/**
 * trees.js — every woody plant taller than three metres, and the timber on the
 * horizon.
 *
 * Parcel `timber-edge`. It draws the two things the sward cannot:
 *
 *   1. **The near timber inside the 640 m box** — the riverbank gallery forest,
 *      the body of timber on the North Division, the sand-ridge oak stringers
 *      threading it, and the sandbar-willow thickets on the point bars.
 *   2. **The timber on the horizon** — the bodies the sources put BEYOND the
 *      modelled ground, drawn as a silhouette band at their true bearing,
 *      angular height and atmospheric contrast.
 *
 * `docs/research/02-flora.md` is the authority: § 1.4, § 1.5 (what the "Dense
 * Forest" north-east of the forks actually was), § 1.6 (the named groves), and
 * ZONE 5, ZONE 6, ZONE 7.
 *
 * The four rules this file is built to obey
 * -----------------------------------------
 *
 * **The plain was OPEN.** Andreas: *"The West Side was an open prairie, entirely
 * free from timber, except for a grove up the South Branch."* The West Division
 * therefore carries NO woody vegetation at all — no gallery, no thicket, not a
 * scattered oak. A treeline in the wrong place is a bigger error than an empty
 * horizon.
 *
 * **The timber was THIN.** § 0: across all PLS corners, 39% of the landscape was
 * open savanna (0–10 trees/ha) and 31% closed savanna (10–50/ha); even ground
 * the surveyors called *timber* was 64% savanna-density, and most bearing trees
 * were 12 inches dbh. Nothing here is a closed eastern hardwood forest: the mean
 * canopy tree is ~30 cm dbh and 15–20 m, and the crowns are open-grown.
 *
 * **Fire made the pattern.** McBride & Bowles found density and fire-intolerant
 * species concentrated on the EAST sides of watercourses, which broke prairie
 * fire running west to east. So the timber sits on the north and east banks and
 * the west banks stay prairie — independently what Andreas describes.
 *
 * **It is July.** Full summer canopy on every woody plant, no autumn colour. The
 * woodland floor (wood nettle, ferns, leaf litter — not spring ephemerals)
 * belongs to `flora.js`, which draws everything at or below 3 m.
 *
 * Why the horizon band computes its own haze
 * ------------------------------------------
 * The band is drawn on a ring at a fixed radius, so the scene's fog — which
 * works on distance to the geometry — would haze a grove four miles out exactly
 * as hard as a treeline at eleven hundred metres. It therefore runs `world.js`'s
 * own haze law by hand against each body's REAL distance, with `fog: false` so
 * the scene does not apply it twice, and one departure: a cap, because the
 * scene's haze is deliberately total by 1500 m and the dossier's horizon timber
 * is at three to six miles. See HAZE_MAX, and docs/LIBERTIES.md **L35**, which
 * records the cap as the liberty it is.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT drawn
 * ------------------------------
 * The Big Woods of north-east Cook, Blue Island, La Framboise Woods and Cottage
 * Grove are all in § 1.6 and all are omitted: at 6 to 14 miles a 60-foot tree on
 * a flat lake plain stands less than a tenth of a degree above a standing eye's
 * horizon — under two pixels, below the contrast threshold, and in two cases
 * below the horizon entirely. `stats.omitted` carries the arithmetic so a critic
 * can check it. Drawing them would be prettier and would be a lie about how far
 * you can see from a flat plain.
 *
 * Where the numbers come from
 * ---------------------------
 * Species, July height, crown width, July foliage colour and confidence are
 * READ FROM `data/flora/zones/*.json` (roles `tree` and `thicket`) through the
 * manifest, per the CONTRACT: the dataset is the durable artifact and a renderer
 * with its own copy of the ecology drifts from it. What stays here is what the
 * records do not carry — the draw archetype per form, and WHERE a tree stands.
 * Zone extents describe ground communities; a tree's position is a question
 * about banks, ridges, fire and which side of the river the town was cutting,
 * answered from the heightfield. The tables below are render parameters and the
 * fallback for a species the records do not describe.

 * surface is Z = 0 and the ground is drawn under it, so a stem rooted anywhere
 * in the 100 mm band between SHORE_Y and the datum passes the mask and then
 * renders standing in open water with its foot invisible. Thirty-six of the

 * 0.20 m, and the number is the geometry rather than a taste: `addTree` sinks a

 * samples by up to 0.03 m (`generators/terrain_gen.py` MESH_FIT_TOLERANCE_M).
 * 0.15 + 0.03 puts the deepest modelled bark exactly at the water plane, so
 * 0.20 leaves 20 mm of daylight under the worst case and nothing more.
 *
 * This is a placement floor, NOT a new waterline: `isWater` still answers the

 * WHERE THE TIMBER STOPS IN THE EAST, and why these are street ids rather than

 *
 * ROADMAP K45(b2). The woody planter used to sweep a fixed square, E/N
 * −316..+316, inside a field S2e carried east to E +1700 — so 73 % of the
 * modelled ground above the planter's own dry floor had never had a stem
 * offered to it. Widening the sweep to the field is one line. Deciding what may
 * grow on the ground it newly reaches is the parcel, and Andreas answers it for
 * both divisions in the same sentence the gallery is already built from:
 *
 *   "On the South Side, a body of timber grew along the river, extending east
 *    as far as WELLS STREET, and following the bend of the river, crossed Clark
 *    Street, and extending south two or three miles" — and the North Side
 *    carried "a body of thrifty heavy growth of timber", EXCEPTING "the sandy
 *    hills near the lake and the marshy places".
 *
 * So the South Division belt has a documented east end — Wells Street — and the
 * North Division one has a documented exception rather than a street: the sandy
 * hills. `z09_sand_prairie` places the relict beach-ridge belt from the State
 * Street break-of-slope east, and `generators/terrain_gen.py` builds that break
 * between E +780 and +880 off the two State Street ground-control points. State
 * Street is therefore where the North Division's timber gives way to the sand,
 * and the woody community that belongs east of it — the open-dune poplars of
 * `z08_lakeshore` — is ROADMAP K45(b) change one and is not built yet. Ground
 * with no community is ground with no stem, which is the honest state of it.
 *
 * They are ids and not numbers because `data/streets/1835.json` already holds
 * both centrelines, surveyed off Wright 1834, and a limit quoted from a street
 * has to move when the street does. Wells stands at E +329.3 and State at
 * E +825.8 in the committed data; the old square's east edge was E +316, so the
 * South Division belt was accidentally within 13 m of its documented end all
 * along and the North Division's was 510 m short of the sand.

 * The cap, and the one place this file argues with the scene's atmosphere.
 * world.js's haze is total by 1500 m by design — docs/LIBERTIES.md L17 leans on
 * that to hide a radial ground skirt nothing is claimed about. But the dossier
 * § 1.6 is a table of timber bodies at three, four and six miles, headed "for
 * distant LOD / horizon silhouettes", and total extinction at 1500 m erases
 * every one of them. Capping the band's haze keeps them on the horizon at a
 * contrast that never exceeds what the scene's own air allows anything else at
 * about 1.2 km. It is a compromise between two parcels' instructions, and it is
 * filed as docs/LIBERTIES.md **L35**.
 *
 * A WARNING ABOUT WHY THIS CONSTANT LOOKS LOAD-BEARING, AND IS NOT.
 *
 * It was briefly recorded — here and in L35 — that this cap had become the only
 * thing keeping the band darker than its own sky, because a fully-hazed surface
 * displayed BRIGHTER than the sky (L 170 against L 162). That measurement was
 * real and its subject was not.
 *
 * The scene's fog does not run where this file assumed. In the vendored r185 the
 * fragment order is `opaque -> tonemapping -> colorspace -> fog`, and the fog
 * colour uniform is uploaded through `getUnlitUniformColorSpace()`. So FogExp2
 * is a straight lerp toward the literal hex IN DISPLAY SPACE, after the tone
 * curve: a fully-fogged pixel is exactly sRGB (136,163,192), L 159.4 — four
 * levels BELOW the horizon sky, which is what airlight is supposed to do.
 *
 * The L 170 came from `hazeDisplayLinear()` below, which USED TO run
 * HORIZON_HAZE through ACES to derive this band's display colour. That was
 * arithmetically correct and answered a question the renderer never asks. The
 * consequence was live and was this file's bug, not the atmosphere's: the band
 * was aimed at (152,175,195) while the ground it stands on converges to
 * (136,163,192), so the far timber sat 16 red and 12 green off the far ground
 * it touches — and because the band is `toneMapped: false, fog: false`, nothing
 * downstream reconciles them. **Fixed 2026-08-13**: the tone curve is gone from
 * that function and both ends now decode the same hex once. The gate compares
 * the band's own hazed end against `scene.fog.color` rather than against a
 * number written down here.
 *
 * So: this cap is about EVIDENCE (holding the dossier's 3-6 mile timber on the
 * horizon), and only about that. Judge it on that argument alone. And do not
 * copy an atmosphere constant into this file and then transform it — the
 * copied values matched world.js exactly the whole time; it was the maths on
 * top of them that drifted, which no drift check on the constants would catch.

 * behind the photographic finding that only 31 % of horizon columns carried any
 * timber; the photograph's own measure is not re-run here, and the item says so.

 * So the modulation may take a bearing down to this and no further, whenever

/**
 * THE ARCHETYPE TABLE IS KEYED BY SPECIES, AND A SPECIES CAN BE RECORDED TWICE.
 *
 * ROADMAP K45(b) change one, and it is the finding this parcel did not expect.
 * `SPECIES` above says "one entry per woody species drawn", and until the
 * lakeshore was routed here that was true. `populus_deltoides` is recorded in
 * BOTH `z05_riverbank_timber` — `tree_gallery`, 22–30 m, 14–22 m crown, the
 * emergent of the floodplain — AND `z08_lakeshore` — `tree_leaning`, 5–15 m,
 * 6–14 m crown, *"isolated, half-buried and leaning, with a sand mound at the
 * base"*. They are the same binomial and nothing else about them is the same.
 *
 * `loadTimberZones` keys its spec map by species id and takes the FIRST zone
 * that names one, so with nothing here the dune would have been planted with
 * twenty-five-metre gallery cottonwoods standing on the open beach — the record
 * read, routed, banded, and drawn as another zone's tree. That is K47's fault
 * one level in, and the reason it is caught here is that the dune is the first
 * community whose cited zone re-describes a species another zone already had.
 *
 * So the archetype — what the record does NOT carry: bole diameter, fork
 * height, foliage-mass count, lean, bark colour — may be given per zone. The
 * record still wins on everything it states. Only the lakeshore needs an entry
 * today; the general repair (a spec map keyed by zone AND species for every
 * community) would redeal the whole town's specs and is its own parcel.
 *
 * **Every number below is invented, as every number in `SPECIES` is**, bounded

/**
 * The communities, and what fraction of the canopy each species holds in them.
 * Weights are the dossier's per-species densities; `perHa` is the STAND density
 * the dossier gives for the community as a whole, which is the number that
 * governs — the per-species figures are microsite densities and sum higher.
 *
 * THE WEIGHT WRITTEN HERE IS THE WEIGHT THAT PLANTS THE STEM (ROADMAP K46).
 * It was not, until 2026-08-16: `mixes` was rebuilt as
 * `records.density[id] ?? fallback`, so one global midpoint per species — taken
 * from whichever `TIMBER_ZONES` entry happened to name it first — overwrote
 * every per-community weight below, and seventeen of the twenty-six entries ran
 * at a number other than the one they are written to.
 *
 * K46 chose the literal, and the reason is a fact about the DATASET rather than
 * a preference. The alternative — key the density by (zone, species) and let
 * each community read the band from the zone its own `dossier` cites — cannot
 * express what this table says, because `wet_woods` cites ZONE 6a and
 * `mesic_pocket` cites ZONE 6b and BOTH resolve to the single record
 * `z06_dense_forest`. A zone-keyed density gives the elm 60 in both, and the
 * 12 that makes it incidental in the fire-protected pocket has nowhere to live.
 * The sub-community reading is real and is recorded nowhere else in this
 * project, so the file keeps it.
 *
 * The record is not discarded; it becomes the CONSTRAINT. Every weight below is
 * checked at load against the band of each zone its community's `zones` names,
 * and one that falls outside every such band is a claim no record carries: it
 * must be declared in that community's `departures`, with the reason, or the
 * load raises. Measured across the twenty-six entries: 23 sit inside their own
 * cited band, 3 fall below one, and none is above — so the hand weights were
 * never an inflation, and the three that depart are the three the prose already
 * explains. `perHa` is the STAND density the dossier gives for the community as
 * a whole, which is the number that governs — the per-species figures are
 * microsite densities and sum higher.
 *
 * `zones` is the machine-readable form of the `dossier` line and is held equal
 * to it by `tools/measure_planting_reach.py`, so the citation a reader sees and
 * the bands the loader checks against cannot drift apart.

/**
 * Head archetype per RECORDED INFLORESCENCE SHAPE, for the woody cohort.
 *
 * K44 measured that three recorded July inflorescences draw no flower and named
 * the cause exactly: *"`trees.js` has no head archetype at all"*. Two of the
 * three are this file's — the **American basswood in bloom** (`flowering`,
 * `cluster_terminal`, sRGB 222,214,152) and the **ironwood's hop-like fruit**
 * (`fruiting`, `cluster_terminal`, 214,212,180), both in `z06_dense_forest` and
 * both in the `mesic_pocket` mix, so both stand in this scene today with nothing
 * on them. The third is the riverbank grape, whose `vine_drape` form no reader
 * implements; it is a ROUTING gap and stays K45(b)'s, not this parcel's.
 *
 * **The repair K44 wrote down is one step short of the truth, and this is the
 * finding.** Handing this file `flora.js`'s `HEAD_OF_SHAPE` verbatim draws
 * `cluster_terminal`'s count — **1 to 4 heads** — because that table is
 * calibrated for a forb, where the whole plant IS one flowering scape. On a
 * basswood the arithmetic says what that looks like: the record's own
 * `size_m` is [0.06, 0.12] m for ONE inflorescence, and a 0.09 m cluster at the
 * 23 m slant range of a neighbouring crown (11 m up, 20 m out) subtends
 * 0.0039 rad — **3.3 px** at this file's `DEFAULT_PX_PER_RAD` of 833. The crown
 * carrying them is 10–16 m across, which is **580 px** at the same range. Four
 * 3-px specks on a 580-px crown is not a tree in flower; it is four pixels of
 * noise, and it would have banked a false pass on K44's own assertion 5.
 *
 * So SIZE comes from the record exactly and MULTIPLICITY is keyed to the crown,
 * which is a liberty and is recorded as one (docs/LIBERTIES.md L115) for the
 * same reason `flora.js`'s is (L35): **the records give the density of PLANTS
 * and the size of ONE inflorescence, and say nothing about how many a plant
 * carries.** Keying it to the crown rather than to a constant is what makes an
 * 18 m basswood and a 7 m ironwood differ by their own evidenced `width_m`
 * instead of by a number typed here.
 *
 *   kind   which archetype draws it. `cluster` is a small dense blob; a
 *          pendulous `catkin` is drawn longer than it is wide. At 3 px the
 *          difference is a silhouette, not a shape, which is why there are two
 *          and not nine — this file is not `flora.js` and must not pretend the
 *          extra archetypes are resolvable at the ranges it draws at.
 *   perM   heads per metre of crown width, before the clamp below.
 *   band   how far DOWN from `height_frac` the heads are carried, as a fraction
 *          of crown height. A terminal cluster sits in the outer shell of the
 *          canopy; it is not scattered through its interior, where nothing
 *          would see it.
 *
 * The map is exhaustive over the shapes the woody records actually carry, and a
 * shape it cannot draw is REPORTED and draws nothing rather than being quietly
 * substituted — the same rule as `flora.js`, for the same reason.

 * vertex colour displays as exactly the sRGB hex it decodes from. The ground's

 * What that error cost is measured in docs/LIBERTIES.md L35: the band was aimed

 * means the band never meets the lerp that would have closed the gap. That is

 * than the atmosphere's: the copied constants matched `world.js` exactly the
 * whole time; it was the maths on top of them that drifted.

  // THE COLUMNAR LADDER IS NEW WITH T-0117 AND IT REDRAWS THREE SPECIES, not
  // one. `columnar` was carried by `FORM_OF` and by the dune's aspen and balsam
  // poplar from the day this file learned the dune, and it drew through the
  // `else` branch above — a SCATTER: `hy` anywhere in 0.14–0.98, the offset up
  // to 0.36 of the crown. On a crown as wide as it is tall that reads as a tree.
  // On a Lombardy poplar it cannot: the record's own crown is 1.4–2.4 m on a
  // 12–18 m stem, an aspect near 8:1, and masses thrown at random heights up
  // fourteen metres of leader are separate blobs on a stick with daylight
  // between them — the same "you can see straight through the stand" failure
  // the limbs above were added to fix, one tree in. Shot rather than argued:
  // even on the even ladder, at ten masses the notches showed from thirty
  // metres, which is why the archetype above asks for fourteen.
  //
  // So a columnar crown is built the way the tree grows: the masses are FILED
  // EVENLY from the base of the crown to the tip, close to the axis, and each
  // one is drawn at half the crown's width so consecutive masses touch. The
  // even ladder is what makes a spire rather than a stack, and it is right for
  // all three species that declare the form — an aspen and a balsam poplar
  // carry their foliage up a narrow leader too; they were being drawn as small

   * WHICH SPECIES STANDS AT THIS STEM — drawn against its own running deficit.
   *
   * ROADMAP K48. The weights in `COMMUNITIES` are SHARES of the stand: `perHa`
   * decides how many stems a hectare of this community holds and the mix
   * decides what they are, so a species' expected count is `share × stems`.
   * Until 2026-08-16 every stem was an INDEPENDENT draw on that share, and an
   * independent draw loses the rare end of a distribution. The American
   * sycamore is 2 of the gallery's 116 over 115 gallery stems — 1.98 expected —
   * and the seeded shuffle dealt NONE. That is a 13.5 % outcome on independent
   * draws, and because this scene is seeded it was not bad luck that would come
   * out next time: it was permanent. Three more species stood as a single stem,
   * so the sycamore was the tail of a distribution rather than a special case.
   *
   * So the draw is corrected against what it already owes. Each species carries
   * `share × drawn − placed`, its shortfall at this stem, and the draw is made
   * proportional to that shortfall instead of to the share — except that a
   * species already owed a WHOLE stem takes the next one outright. Two bounds
   * follow by construction, and they are what the smoke asserts:
   *
   *   - **Nothing overshoots by a stem.** `placed` only ever increments while
   *     `placed < share × drawn`, so no species can end up more than one stem
   *     above what its own weight asks for.
   *   - **Nothing owed a whole stem gets none.** The moment a shortfall reaches
   *     one stem the next stem is that species'.
   *
   * Stress-tested over 35,880 (mix, stand size, seed) cases on the four
   * communities and the edge list, at stand sizes 4 to 900: worst overshoot
   * 0.99 stems, worst shortfall 1.21, and not one species owed a whole stem
   * standing nowhere. Without the outright rule the worst shortfall is 2.32 and
   * 17 of those cases lose a species that the stand owed a stem to.
   *
   * It stays a DRAW. Which species stands at any one stem is still random
   * except where a shortfall has reached a stem (22 % of them), so a stand does
   * not come out combed the way a strict rotation over a raster scan order
   * would.
   *
   * THE WHOLE WOOD IS RE-DEALT, and saying otherwise would be the easy lie
   * here. This consumes exactly the one `rnd()` per stem the independent draw
   * consumed, at the same point in the same stream — but `addTree` draws a
   * tree's own bole, taper and puffs from that same stream and takes a
   * different NUMBER of draws per species, so changing which species stands at
   * one stem shifts every draw after it. Measured on the published mirror at
   * both viewports: 163 stems became 178 and 214 thicket stools became 213.
   * Nothing that decides HOW MANY stems a hectare holds changed — `perHa`,
   * `edgeFade`, `clearedFactor` and the waterline gate are untouched — so that
   * is the same Bernoulli placement re-dealt, not a denser wood.
   *
   * Nothing about WHERE a stem stands changes. This consumes exactly the one
   * `rnd()` per stem the independent draw consumed, at the same point in the
   * same stream, so the positions, the thickets, the shapes and every other
   * consumer of that stream are untouched. What changes is which tree you are
   * standing under.
   *
   * It also does not touch a weight, a density or a band — see K48's box for
   * why neither of the two repairs that DO can be built.

   * ONE BATCH, CULLED PER CHUNK, IN BOTH PASSES — T-0223 step one.
   *
   * The lattice above is only affordable because of what this object is. A
   * `BatchedMesh` holds every chunk in one pair of buffers and submits the
   * visible ones as a SINGLE `WEBGL_multi_draw` call, deciding per chunk which
   * to include from that chunk's own bounding sphere. It does it in the colour
   * pass through `onBeforeRender` (the view camera) and in the shadow pass
   * through `onBeforeShadow`, which three routes to the same code with the
   * SHADOW camera — so the sun's ±240 m box finally rejects the timber standing
   * outside it, which is the whole of what T-0223 measured and costed.
   *
   * The old four quadrant meshes were four calls in the colour pass and four
   * more in the sun's. This is one and one. Draw calls FALL by six at the worst
   * stand while the chunk count rises from 4 to about seventy, which is the
   * trade the ticket said had to be watched: "the colour pass must NOT gain 40
   * calls to save the shadow pass."
   *
   * WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. `renderer.info` counts a multi-draw as one call
   * because it is one call, but the driver still issues a sub-draw per chunk,
   * so this is not free on a real GPU the way the counter makes it look. The
   * lattice is 120 m rather than 40 for that reason — the shadow saving is
   * nearly all won by the first halving, and the sub-draw count is what pays
   * for the rest.
   *
   * The batch matrices are all identity: the chunk geometries carry absolute
   * world coordinates, exactly as the four quadrant meshes did. That is what
   * keeps the wind shader above correct — it reads `modelMatrix * transformed`
   * for its world position, which under batching skips the (identity) per-chunk
   * matrix that `project_vertex` would otherwise apply.
