/**
 * changelog.js — in the PUBLISHED MIRROR ONLY, a re-export (T-0722).
 *
 * The changelog is authored at renderers/web/js/changelog.js, because the
 * walkthrough's What's-new tab imports it and a page cannot import from its own
 * publish mirror. tools/publish.sh copies that file to <site>/js/changelog.js,
 * which is the path Manager and the polecat.live launcher parse and which must
 * not move.
 *
 * It used to also arrive here verbatim, so the mirror shipped 1.31 MB twice —
 * 4.1 % of the site budget, growing at double the rate of the record itself.
 * This re-exports the fleet copy instead. Same module interface, half the bytes.
 *
 * Do not edit: tools/stamp-changelog.mjs writes this file, and tools/publish.sh
 * calls it to. The changelog itself lives at
 * chicago/4d/renderers/web/js/changelog.js.
