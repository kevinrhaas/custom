/**
 * intent.js — the single input-intent object.
 *
 * Every input backend writes THIS and nothing else. The walker reads THIS and
 * nothing else. No backend touches the camera, and exactly one backend is active
 * at a time, so "why is the camera moving" always has one answer.
 *
 * The alternative — pointer-lock moving the camera directly while a touch layer
 * moves it too — is how you get a scene that walks twice as fast on a laptop
 * with a touchscreen, and it is the bug you find last.
 *
 * Fields, all in the walker's units:
 *
 *   forward    -1 back .. +1 ahead        (analogue: a thumbstick gives 0.4)
 *   strafe     -1 left .. +1 right
 *   rise       -1 down .. +1 up           (free-fly only; ignored on foot)
 *   yawDelta   radians to turn this frame, + is left (counter-clockwise)
 *   pitchDelta radians to look up this frame, + is up
 *   sprint     boolean
 *   flying     boolean — the mode, not a keypress
 *   interact   edge-triggered; consume it with `takeInteract()`
 *
 * `flying` sits here rather than in the walker or the HUD for the same reason
 * everything else does: two backends and the HUD all need to agree on it, and
 * the moment it has two homes they will disagree. It also changes what a key
 * MEANS — Space inspects on foot and ascends in the air — so the backend that
 * reads the key has to be able to see the mode.
 *
 * `interactPoint` rides along with `interact`: a crosshair inspection has no
 * point (null) and a tap has the one you tapped, in normalised device coords.
 * `interactSource` says which gesture asked — 'key' or 'point' — because the
 * inspect KEY toggles an open card shut while a click always re-inspects
 * (T-0108), and by consumption time the event is long gone.
 * It lives on the intent rather than in a backend callback so that "what did the
 * visitor ask for" is still answered by exactly one object.
