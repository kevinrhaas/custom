/**
 * popup.js — pick a building, read its provenance.
 *
 * This is the other half of the confidence view, and the reason the project
 * exists: the tint you see and the citation you can quote come from the SAME
 * sidecar record, so they cannot drift apart. If the shader says amber, the
 * table says `reconstructed`, and the note underneath says why.
 *
 * The card reads top-down like a label and bottom-up like a catalogue. First
 * what the building IS: title, other names, its kind, where it stood, the flags
 * that qualify the whole record, the phase's own account (or a lead composed
 * strictly from record fields when none was written), and a facts grid —
 * standing, use, fabric, roof, address, ground, who was here, keepers — each
 * with a quiet dot for its grade. Then the households the residents layer
 * places here. Then, behind three tabs: EVIDENCE (what we included and where
 * it came from, where it stood, whether it was here, whether it was this shape,
 * every attribute with its chip and reasoning, the citations), WHAT WE MADE UP
 * (the liberties taken with THIS building and any tracked open question) and
 * RECORD (the record's own account, the production reference, the dossier
 * link). The dots and the chips grade the same claims: the dot is the label's
 * summary, the chip in the table is the claim itself, and the smoke counts only
 * the chips (`css/card.css` § facts explains why there is never a chip up top).
 *
 * The open question is the newest section and it qualifies the two claims above
 * it rather than adding a third. A chip says how sure we are; it cannot say that
 * the uncertainty is a live dispute between two sources, that the grade is being
 * held down deliberately until evidence arrives, and what would change if it did.
 * That was readable in the Evidence panel — whose entry for the standing one says
 * in as many words that "the provenance card shows it" — and not on the building
 * the panel is talking about. Same gap the liberties had, closed the same way.
 *
 * The shape is the newest of those and was the largest silence. The footprint is
 * the biggest single claim a visitor stands in front of, six of the eight in
 * this dataset are placeholders that say so in their first line, and the card
 * showed no chip, no source and no reasoning for any of them — while the
 * confidence tint had been narrowed to stop carrying dimensional uncertainty on
 * the stated understanding that the card would carry it instead.
 *
 * "Whether it was here at all" is the newest of those and was the oldest gap.
 * This file has read `documented_range` since it was written and the sidecar
 * compiler never wrote the field, so the line never rendered once: the claim the
 * entire scene rests on — that this building stood in Chicago on 1 July 1835 —
 * was the one claim on the card with no chip, no source and no reasoning, while
 * a roof pitch had all three. The same was half-true of the position, whose
 * argument is often the longest thing in the record and reached the card as a
 * bare chip. Both now render through the attribute table's own row renderer,
 * because a card that qualified its load-bearing claims differently from its
 * details is how the two drift.
 *
 * The liberties section is the answer to a gap this card had until now. An
 * attribute chip tells a visitor how sure we are of a value we recorded; it
 * cannot tell them about the decisions that belong to no attribute — that the
 * Green Tree's footprint was reasoned out of a room module and its side
 * additions deliberately left off, that three Wolf Point buildings were placed
 * from bank geometry because no corner survives. Those were readable in the
 * Evidence panel as one undifferentiated list of eighteen. Now the ones that
 * constrain the building you are looking at are on the building you are looking
 * at, which is where a visitor would think to ask.
 *
 * The attribute table now answers a second question beside "how sure are you":
 * whether you are looking at the thing at all. An attribute its archetype never
 * reads is marked — `not built` where the model contains nothing of it, `not
 * modelled from this` where a fixed default stands in its place — because a
 * `attested` chip over an unbuilt feature is true about the evidence and false
 * about the view, and the view is what a visitor is standing in.
 *
 * The record's own account is the newest section and the last of the compiled
 * fields that reached no visitor. Every structure record carries a
 * `research_note` written for a reader — what it actually asserts, which sources
 * disagree, what was decided and why, where the record is weakest — and it was
 * compiled into every sidecar and shown nowhere. That is not the same fault as
 * the two before it: nothing was broken, the field simply had no surface. It is
 * shown verbatim, because a note about how far the evidence goes is the last
 * thing on this card that should be summarised by a program.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a display value. An attribute with no note shows no note.
 * A citation with no archived copy says so, because the archived copy is part of
 * whether a claim can be re-read at all. And a building with no recorded
 * liberties says exactly that — that none were written down, which is not the
 * same claim as none having been taken.

/**
 * What did we include at each level, and where did it come from?
 *
 * The owner asked for this from a card on the dev preview, and the ask was
 * precise: *"when you say what we made up, say what we included in the
 * recreation, or what we included in the inferred building, or what we included
 * in the attested building."* Everything needed to answer was already on the
 * card and none of it was answered — a visitor could read nineteen rows, each
 * with its own chip, and still not be able to say which parts of the building in
 * front of them are evidence and which are ours. The parts were all there; the
 * summary a person reads FIRST was not.
 *
 * It is a partition, not a highlight reel. Every graded claim the card renders
 * below lands in exactly one row here — the presence claim, the position, the
 * outline and every attribute — so the counts add up to the card and a claim
 * cannot be quietly left out of the summary of itself. That is also what makes
 * it gateable: `smoke_renderer.mjs` recounts the chips off the RENDERED card and
 * requires the same three numbers, which is the only form of this section that
 * cannot drift from the card it describes.
 *
 * The three glosses are the Evidence panel's own words, trimmed at a clause
 * boundary so each is a literal substring of the legend in `index.html` — the
 * liberties' rule, applied to prose that has no shared renderer to hold it. Two
 * surfaces defining `inferred` differently is exactly the drift K23a spent a run
 * cleaning up.
 *
 * WHAT THE SOURCES MEAN CHANGES WITH THE LEVEL, and printing one label over all
 * three would be the same category error the card's own history is made of. On
 * an `attested` claim a source is where the value came FROM. On a `reconstructed`
 * one it is what BOUNDED an invention — the record's own note says so in as many
 * words ("the spec is cited because the invention is bounded by it, which is what
 * makes it defensible rather than arbitrary") — and reading that as attribution
 * would turn the citation into evidence for a building nobody claims existed.
 *
 * An empty level says so rather than disappearing. A building with nothing
 * attested is the single most important thing this section can tell a visitor,
 * and a row that renders only when it is non-empty is a row that goes silent
 * exactly when it matters most. The same reasoning the liberties use for their
 * "none are recorded" note, in the opposite direction.
 *
 * And it does not claim to cover the liberties. A liberty belongs to no
 * attribute — that is why it has its own section — so the lead points at "What we
 * made up here" instead of pretending three rows of claim labels are the whole of
 * what was invented.
