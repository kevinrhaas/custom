/**
 * exclusions.js — "what is not here", in the walkthrough.
 *
 * Eight buildings stand in a town the sources describe with roughly forty, and
 * from the air that emptiness is the most honest thing in the scene. What it
 * cannot show is the difference between three completely different statements:
 * a structure absent because nobody has researched it yet, one absent because
 * the evidence dates it after 1 July 1835, and one absent because it had already
 * come down. The first is a gap in the work. The other two are findings — they
 * cost research to establish, they carry citations, and until now they lived only
 * in `data/exclusions.json`, where the one audience that cannot read them is the
 * visitor standing in the gap.
 *
 * That file is the research record and stays authored by hand;
 * `tools/compile_scene.py` derives the per-scene view with the citations joined,
 * filtered by the scene's own year — an entry dating a building to 1837 is not an
 * exclusion from an 1837 scene — and `tools/check.sh` re-derives it, so this list
 * cannot fall behind the record it is quoting.
 *
 * The list deliberately does NOT claim to be everything missing. Most of the town
 * is simply not built yet, and saying otherwise would turn an honest hole into a
 * false claim of completeness — which is the failure mode this whole panel exists
 * to avoid.

 * The chip is derived from the scene, not from the entry: whether a structure

 * compiler answers it. That is what keeps this section from being false about the
 * one building on it a visitor can walk up to — the Western Hotel is HERE, and its
 * doubt is about the date on its own card rather than about whether to build it.
 *
 * `onCard` is the same affordance the liberties have: one renderer, two surfaces,
 * so the panel and the provenance card cannot describe one uncertainty
 * differently. Two things change and nothing else does. The chip drops "standing
 * here", which on the card is the visitor's own position rather than news, and
 * carries only the grade of the claim the doubt sits on — a field's value, not a
 * phrase composed here. And the line that points at the card stops pointing at
 * the card it is printed on: on the panel it says the provenance card shows this
 * claim, and on the card it names the claim shown a few centimetres above.
