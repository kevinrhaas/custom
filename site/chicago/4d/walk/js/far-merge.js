/**
 * far-merge.js — give a draw call back when chunking has stopped buying
 * anything with it.
 *
 * T-0146, the second of T-0149's three pieces. The first (T-0150) stopped
 * drawing furniture beyond a reach at `light`. This one is about the two tiers
 * that have no reach: `full` and `balanced`, where the axial stands draw the
 * whole town and every chunk is its own call.
 *
 * ## The trade this undoes, exactly where it stops paying
 *
 * The 2026-08-21 chunking (T-0067, T-0068, T-0069, T-0119) deliberately
 * converted triangles into draw calls: one town-wide fence mesh has a bounding
 * sphere no frustum can cull, so 33,166 triangles of fence were drawn in every
 * frame including the fences behind you. Splitting the layer into patches of
 * ground gives the frustum something to skip, and at an ordinary stand it skips
 * a lot. `main.js` § BUDGET says so in the same words: *"the call count is the
 * price of the culling that keeps those ceilings reachable"*.
 *
 * A price is only worth paying while something is bought with it. Down Lake
 * Street from Canal nothing is behind the camera, the whole town is inside the
 * frustum, and the frustum skips **nothing** — so the chunk boundaries in that
 * frame are pure loss: 53 calls for the wagon yard's 64,640 triangles, 48 for
 * the fences, 38 for the plank walks, measured on the published mirror at
 * `full` (`tools/measure_stand_budget.mjs --stand lake_at_canal`). This module
 * watches for exactly that condition and, while it holds, submits the chunks as
 * ONE mesh instead of many.
 *
 * ## The two conditions, and why each one makes the merge free
 *
 * A cluster is a fixed patch of ground — `CLUSTER_M` across — holding the chunk
 * meshes whose own spheres centre inside it. It is merged for a frame only when
 * BOTH of these are true of the cluster's bounding sphere:
 *
 *  1. **It is wholly inside the view frustum.** Then no member of it could have
 *    been culled this frame, so drawing the cluster as one mesh submits the
 *    identical set of triangles — the saving is in calls and the triangle count
 *    is unchanged, not approximately but exactly. This is the condition that
 *    matters: the ceilings at the axial stands have four figures of headroom
 *    (1,423,855 against 1,425,000 at `full`), so a merge that could ADD a
 *    triangle would be a worse bargain than the calls it saves. It cannot.
 *  2. **Every part of it is more than `FAR_M` from the eye.** The sun's pass
 *    draws a caster a second time, and its rig is an orthographic box `±r` in
 *    LIGHT space around the visitor (`world.setShadowRig`), r = 240 m at `full`
 *    and `balanced`. A point whose light-space |x| and |y| are both within 240
 *    lies within 240·√2 = 339.4 m of the centre, so anything beyond 340 m is
 *    outside that box whatever the sun's bearing. A merged cluster is therefore
 *    made of meshes that were contributing nothing to the shadow map, the
 *    merged mesh does not cast, and the shadow pass reads the same before and
 *    after. No bound, no tuning: a stated distance and the geometry of a box.
 *
 * Composition with T-0150 is the third condition and it is not a bound either:
 * a cluster with any member the reach is holding back is left alone, so at
 * `light` — where the reach is 300 m and this module's floor is 340 — nothing
 * is ever merged and nothing here can put back a triangle that tier gave up.
 *
 * ## What it is not
 *
 * It is not an LOD and not a simplification: no vertex is moved, dropped or
 * re-typed, no material changes, and the confidence attribute rides along in
 * the merged buffer so the confidence view colours a merged cluster exactly as
 * it colours the chunks. It is a change of BATCHING and nothing else — which is
 * why it can be applied at every tier without the tier meaning something
 * different.
 *
 * Picking is untouched for the same reason it has to be: the chunk meshes stay
 * in the scene and in the arrays each layer raycasts (`enclosures.pickAt`,
 * `yard.pickAt`, …). `THREE.Raycaster` does not test `visible` — it walks the
 * array it is handed — so a merged-away chunk still answers a click with its
 * own `pickId` and its own chunk-local `faceIndex`. The merged mesh itself is
 * given an empty `raycast` so it can never answer instead.
 *
 * Buffers are built LAZILY, the first frame a cluster actually qualifies, and
 * then kept. A cluster a visitor never stands far enough back from never costs
 * a byte, and a town walked end to end settles at roughly one extra copy of the
 * merged layers' vertex data.
