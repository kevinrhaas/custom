/**
 * confidence.js — THE confidence view.
 *
 * `docs/PROVENANCE.md`: "For a museum, a classroom, or a civic audience this is
 * the single most valuable thing the project offers." It is a deliverable, not a
 * debug overlay, and it is implemented exactly once — as a single
 * `onBeforeCompile` patch on the shared building material — so that it cannot be
 * forgotten per-building.
 *
 * The channel is `_CONFIDENCE`, a custom glTF SCALAR float attribute
 * (docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md): 0.0 documented, 0.5 derived, 1.0 inferred.
 * GLTFLoader lowercases unknown attributes, so it arrives as
 * `geometry.attributes._confidence`. three will not wire it up for us and must
 * not: it is data, not colour, and nothing may tint by accident. We declare the
 * attribute in the patch and carry it to the fragment stage ourselves.
 *
 * How each level renders when the view is on:
 *
 *   documented   unchanged
 *   inferred     lerped toward amber
 *   inferred     screen-door dithered translucent massing — an ordered 4x4
 *                Bayer threshold against gl_FragCoord with a `discard`, IN THE
 *                OPAQUE PASS. No blending, no depth sorting, no per-object
 *                render order. That is what lets it work inside one BatchedMesh,
 *                where every building shares a draw call and sorting is not
 *                available even in principle.
