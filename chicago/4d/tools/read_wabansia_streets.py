WHAT THIS FILE IS. Wabansia — Wright letters it *Wonbonsia*, the Democrat and Andreas
*Wabansia* — is the tract north of Kinzie Street and west of the North Branch, surveyed
in 1831 and the earliest speculative addition laid out at Chicago. The project has had
nothing there: no street, no block, no tract edge. This is the first reading of its
street grid, and it reads the EAST-WEST corridors only. It authors no ground: a corridor
here is a pair of ruled lines on a raster, and where that pair belongs on modern ground
is the seating question T-0790's successor carries.

THE SHEET is the National Archives / Historic Urban Plans facsimile registered as
`wright_1834_nara_hup` (5050 x 6628 px at 600 dpi), the same sheet and the same affine
T-1060 and T-1061 read Kinzie's Addition on, for the same reason: at 600 dpi the ruled
lines separate and the lettering can be read letter by letter.

THE METHOD is T-1060's, imported rather than copied — `_profile` projects a window's ink
onto one axis along a fitted shear, `_rules` takes the sharp narrow peaks as ruled lines,
`_frame` carries a pixel to local ENU through the sheet's own committed affine. What is
new here is the DISCRIMINATION, because Wabansia's does not work the way the Addition's
did. In Kinzie's Addition a street corridor is wider than the gaps around it and a width
test finds it. In Wabansia it is not: the blocks are four lots deep at a 33 px lot pitch
and the corridors run 29-39 px, so a width test cannot tell a street from a lot line and
returned five wrong corridors when it was tried. What settles it is Wright's own
lettering: he writes each name INSIDE its corridor, so the corridor is the rule pair that
brackets the name's glyphs, and every pair below was confirmed against the crop the name
was read in. That is why `label_crop_px` is committed beside `rule_px_y` — the crop is
the evidence for which pair was taken, not decoration.

THE TWO DOUBTS THE OWNER RAISED, both settled here on the registered scan:

  * `Right` or `Hight` — HIGHT. The capital carries a looped ascender and a second
    vertical joined by a mid-height crossbar, and it is the same glyph Wright draws for
    the H of `Hubbard` two corridors south on the same sheet. An R in this hand has a
    bowl; this has none. The two crops are committed side by side so the next reader can
    disagree with the comparison rather than with an assertion.
  * `Kain` or `Kane` — KAIN. The third letter carries a dot and the fourth is an n with
    two shoulders; there is no terminal e. This street is inside the water-lot triangle,
    not in the block grid, and is recorded here as a name only.

WHAT IS NOT READ, and is the next run's, not a gap to be filled by guessing:

  * The NORTH-SOUTH streets. Wright letters none of them in Wabansia, so the lettering
    that disciplines the east-west read has nothing to say about them, and the width test
    that would have to stand in its place is the one this tract defeats.
  * The BLOCK NUMERALS (some 79 of them), the water-lot strip, the tract polygon, and
    who the sources put on the ground. T-0790 was split for them.
  * The SEATING. Wabansia's south line is Kinzie Street, which this project has already
    committed off the Thompson plat, so the sheet can be priced against it: § cross_check
    carries the gap, and it is well inside the 16.19 m RMS this sheet's own registration
    admits. A gap that small is a reason to seat the tract on the committed line rather
    than on the sheet — but a seating is a separate demonstration and is not made here.
