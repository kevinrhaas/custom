"""CARRY THE ANONYMOUS-ROOF ADJUDICATION OUT IN THE RECIPES. T-1451.

    tools/execute_roof_redeal.py --apply       execute what can be executed, write the report
    tools/execute_roof_redeal.py --check       re-derive and refuse drift
    tools/execute_roof_redeal.py --self-test   the guards, fired on fixtures

T-1445 adjudicated the town's 285 anonymous roofs against the re-derived
programme and wrote `data/reconstruction/1835_roof_redeal.json`: 253 keep, 32
refamily, 0 retire. That file MOVES NO ROOF. This tool is the other half --- it
carries the verdicts back into the authored recipes, so the generators re-derive
the records rather than anybody hand-editing 32 of them.

THE SPLIT THIS TOOL MAKES, AND WHY IT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE. A verdict is
executable here only if carrying it out leaves the RECORD ID alone:

  * `generate_west_infill.py` reads a placement's id from the recipe
    (`west_rec_008` -> `recon_1835_west_008`) and its family from a separate
    field. Refamilying is a one-field edit and nothing downstream is renamed.

  * The other three generators BUILD THE ID OUT OF THE FAMILY ---
    `recon_1835_south_{family}_{seq:03d}`, `recon_1835_north_{suffix}`,
    `recon_1835_blk_{block}_{family}_{seq:02d}`. Refamilying `..._c1_003` makes
    it `..._d1_003`, and that id is not private to its record: it is named by
    `data/sidecars/1835/`, `data/enclosures/`, `data/liberties.json`,
    `data/signage/`, `data/yard/`, `data/frontage/`, the lodger and seating
    files and the business layer. Those 26 verdicts are an ID MIGRATION across
    the derived layer, not an edit. T-1452 was split once the surface was
    measured: `tools/measure_roof_id_migration.py` classifies every reference
    they stand on, and T-1481 (south), T-1482 (the platted blocks) and T-1484
    (north) carry them out.

So the tool executes the six West Division verdicts, RECORDS the other 26 as
outstanding with the files that name each one, and refuses to pretend the
difference away. An executor that quietly renamed 26 ids and left ten files
pointing at roofs that no longer exist would pass its own check and break the
town.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO, each refusal recorded rather than worked round:

  * A CONFIDENCE IS NEVER UPGRADED. These roofs are `inferred_anonymous` before
    and after. Refamilying changes what an invented building is, never how well
    attested it is.

  * NO VERDICT IS INVENTED HERE. Every family this tool writes is the
    `to_family` T-1445 reached, and the reason written beside it is T-1445's own
    reason, quoted. This tool adjudicates nothing.

  * A FOOTPRINT ONLY MOVES WHEN THE BAND REFUSES THE OLD ONE. 28 of the 32
    refamilied roofs land in a band their committed footprint already fits, and
    those keep every dimension they had. Where the band does refuse, the tool
    takes the band CORNER NEAREST THE STANDING AREA --- the smallest change the
    new family allows --- and never a size chosen to look right.

  * A RETIREMENT IS A SUBSTITUTION, NOT A DEMOLITION. Retire verdicts leave the
    standing count through `data/exclusions.json` under a `retired_reconstruction`
    guard that carries the bucket the roof left and the liberty tokens it
    resolved. The adjudication retires NONE today, so the guard stands empty ---
    which is a measurement, not an omission, and `--check` says the number.

# verdict out where the record id does not move. `generate_north_infill` builds
# the id out of the family and the sequence (`recon_1835_north_c1_020` ->
# `..._d3_020`), so carrying the same verdict out here RENAMES a record that
# twenty-odd other committed files name. The rules that decide the new family
# and the new footprint are the ones above, imported rather than restated: a
# migration that adjudicated anything of its own would be a second opinion about
# a town this tool does not adjudicate.
#
# WHAT THE MIGRATION OWNS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES:
#
#   * THE ARCHETYPE IS ASKED OF THE GENERATOR THAT BUILDS THE PARCEL, not of the
#     crosswalk. They disagree about H2 --- the crosswalk's placeholder is
#     `frame_dwelling` and `generate_north_infill.archetype_for` returns
#     `frame_tavern` --- and it is the generator's answer that decides whether
#     `frame_dwelling_params`' eaves-front refusal applies to a roof. Asking the
#     crosswalk here would have cut two boarding houses to a proportion nothing
#     was going to enforce on them.
#
#   * THE INVENTORY CLASS FOLLOWS THE GROUP. `recon_1835_north_c1_047` is moved
#     from a store to a stable, and a stable is not a principal functional roof.
#     The north recipe authors the class per placement and gates its own 45/15
#     mix, so the class moves with the family and the mix is recounted --- it is
#     not a number chosen to keep the old total. This is the same principal /
#     ancillary line T-1482 has to re-deal for the platted blocks; here it is one
#     roof and the recipe's own counter is the whole of the arithmetic.
#
#   * A YARD GROUP NAMED AFTER A MIGRATED ROOF MOVES WITH IT. Three ancillary
#     placements sit in `nw_w2_005_yard`, `wk_w1_018_yard` and `re_c1_047_yard`
#     --- yards named for the roof they stand behind. Leaving those strings
#     behind would leave three yards named for buildings that no longer exist,
#     which is the rot this ticket is about.
#
#   * A RECEIPT IS NOT A REFERENCE. `renderers/unreal/receipts/` pins a signed
#     build to a `scene_source_commit`, `docs/unreal/prototype/` holds the import
#     report that build produced, and `tickets/` records what was found on a day.
#     All three name these roofs by the id they had then, and all three are
#     TRUE as written. Rewriting a dated measurement so it agrees with today is
#     falsifying it, so they are pinned and `--check-migration` counts them as
#     pinned rather than stale --- and names them, so the exemption is visible
#     rather than silent.
#
#   * THE DERIVED FILES ARE RE-DERIVED, NEVER REWRITTEN. The adjudication ledger
#     and its two reports name every migrated roof, and they are the measurement
#     of whether the migration worked: a rewritten ledger would agree with the
#     migration by construction. They are excluded from the substitution and
#     regenerated, which is how `--check` can ask the live adjudication whether
#     each migrated roof now returns `keep`.
