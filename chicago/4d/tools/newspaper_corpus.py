"""The 1833-1835 newspaper corpus, made citable — build it, and gate it.

    tools/newspaper_corpus.py --build [--deposit PATH]   rebuild corpus.json + derived text
    tools/newspaper_corpus.py --check                    the gate (runs without the deposit)
    tools/newspaper_corpus.py --self-test                the gate's assertions still fire

WHAT THIS IS FOR. `chicago/reference/newspapers/Transcriptions/` holds the owner's
archival deposit: 86 issues of the Chicago Democrat (1833-11-26 to 1835-08-26) and
the Chicago American (1835-06-08 to 1835-08-29), transcribed under the methodology
in that folder's own `Newspaper_Transcription_Workflow.md`. The scene date sits
inside both runs and a Democrat was PRINTED on 1835-07-01. Until now nothing in
this project could resolve a citation into that deposit, so nothing could be cited
out of it. `data/research/newspapers/corpus.json` is that resolver, and every later
ticket in the PAPERS epic resolves against it.

THE DEPOSIT IS ON `main`, THIS SUBTREE IS DEVELOPED ON `dev`. The transcriptions
were committed to `main` on 2026-08-28 and have not been back-merged; a `dev`
checkout has `chicago/reference/` WITHOUT `newspapers/`. That is not a defect in
this tool and it must not be papered over, so the deposit is handled as three
states rather than two:

  present   — every reference path is resolved, file by file, and a missing one FAILS.
  absent    — the whole `newspapers/` subtree is missing, which is what `dev` looks
              like today. Derived text is still fully checked; the reference tier is
              reported as unresolvable-here and the gate stays green.
  partial   — the subtree exists and a file named by the corpus does not. FAILS,
              always. This is the state that means damage, and it is the reason the
              absent case is tested wholesale rather than per-file.

Merging `main` into `dev` today is NOT the fix: main carries sixty Finder-duplicate
`... 2.json`/`... 2.glb` files under `site/chicago/4d/data/`, and merging it turns
this repo's gate red in twenty-three places. T-0275 carries that.

DERIVED TEXT. Twenty-three of the deposit's transcriptions exist only as .docx —
the entire American run, the Democrat's 1835 tail, and three alternate witnesses.
`tools/docx_text.py` extracts them, deterministically and with the standard library
alone, to `data/research/newspapers/text/`. Those files are COMMITTED, which is
what makes an American citation resolvable on a branch that has no deposit. The
sixty-six issues that already carry a committed .txt are NOT copied: they are cited
at their archival path, per the ticket, and re-copying them would put a second,
divergeable transcript of the same issue in the repo.

`data/research/` IS RESEARCH, NOT PAYLOAD. `tools/publish.sh` copies named
subdirectories of `data/` and this is not one of them; the gate asserts that
nothing under `data/research/` has reached `site/chicago/4d/`, so the corpus can
grow without touching the 14 MB the walkthrough actually ships.
