"""The ten group rows, split by division, against the roofs that actually stand there.

Ticket T-0211, found by T-0032 (PR #388). `data/reconstruction/1835_building_inventory.json`
carries the same aggregate three ways — `family_targets` (35 families), `district_group_matrix`
(10 groups x 4 divisions) and `districts` (4 totals) — and `tools/reconcile_665.py` asserts
that all three sum to `roof_total` and that each group's families sum to that group's row.
**Nothing asserted anything about a group's split BY DIVISION**, and the two views were
authored independently. T-0032 found what that permits: the `institutional_public` row read
south 10 / west 1 / north 1 while the named institutional records stand south 5 / west 1 /
north 3. Every sum closed, and the schedule was apportioning phantom headroom in one division
while telling another it had room for a building already standing in it.

## Why the I3 repair does not generalise, and what is asserted instead

An institutional row can be held to a census because Chicago's public buildings are
enumerable. Dwellings, stores and barns are not: an anonymous dwelling is a legitimate
count-unit toward a documented aggregate, so "the row equals what stands" is the WRONG
assertion for the other nine rows. A row 74 roofs above what stands is the programme working
as intended.

What this asserts is the weaker pair the ticket asks for, and it is enough to catch the fault:

1. **The matrix is internally addable, by division as well as by group.** Each row's four
   cells sum to that row's own `total`, and each division's ten cells sum to that division's
   own `target`. Neither was asserted anywhere before this. The second is what makes the
   shed below an identity rather than a coincidence.
2. **Every division already OVER its group row is DECLARED, and no new one appears.** A
   ratchet, in the shape `tools/measure_band_claims.py` uses: the residual is real, it may
   shrink, it may not grow, and a division going newly over a row fails here. This is the
   half `reconcile_665.py` could not report, because
   `max(0, matrix[g][district] - built[(district, g)])` clamps the negative away: a row that
   is wrong by six roofs looked exactly like a row that is right.

## What the overshoot costs, which is why it is worth a gate

The clamp does not just hide the breach — it silently RE-SPENDS it. A division's ten clamped
group heads then sum to MORE than that division's remainder (by exactly the overshoot, since
the cells sum to the target), and `reconcile_665.py` sheds the difference one slot at a time
from whichever group has the most head at that moment. So the North Division's seven
overshooting roofs were paid for out of its ordinary dwellings, and until this ticket nothing
anywhere said so. Both figures are now written into the programme document —
`remaining.district_group_rows_overshot` and `remaining.district_group_slots_shed` — so the
ledger reports the transfer it makes.

**Six of those seven are repaired.** T-0283 moved the freight row's split — north 1 → 7 out of
south 17 → 11, with ordinary_dwellings swapping the other way so that both row totals and all
four district targets stand — and the North's shed fell from 7 slots to 1. The one that is left
is the L93 institutional liberty, which is not an authoring fault: it is this gate and
`measure_institutional_claims.py` reading one liberty differently, and it moves when the liberty
is retired. The argument is `district_group_matrix_note` in the inventory.

# A breach is not repairable by editing a cell on its own: the cells sum to their division's

# for the freight row on 2026-08-29 — see `district_group_matrix_note` in the inventory — and
