WHAT THIS IS FOR.

`data/research/newspapers/register_1835.json` reads 2,201 people out of the Democrat
and the American and says, for each, what the committed town would have to do about
them. `replace_invented` is the finding that a trade the town INVENTED a household for
has a documented practitioner — T-0366 and T-0367 spend those. `new_resident` is the
rest: 1,967 documented people this reconstruction does not hold at all.

THIS PASS TAKES ONE SLICE OF THAT, AND THE SLICE IS DEFINED BY THE COMPILER RATHER
THAN BY TASTE. `tools/compile_register.py` gives a person `replace_invented` only when
the trade it reads for him is one the occupation census invented a household for, and
`new_resident` otherwise. So a `new_resident` WITH a trade is, by construction, a
tradesman the town has no roof to offer and never did: an attorney, an auctioneer, a
schoolteacher, a milliner, a hardware merchant. Nobody else's pass can reach him, and
this one cannot reach into theirs. The people with no trade at all are T-0373's; the
1,536 known only from the post office's letter lists are T-0374's.

THEY ARRIVE WITHOUT A ROOF, AND THAT IS THE HONEST ANSWER RATHER THAN A GAP.

Nothing reached says where any of these people slept. `data/town_census.json` already
counts 52 households whose `lives_at` names nothing, so this dataset has always been
able to hold a person the sources put in the town and nowhere in it. A household here
is a CONTAINER and not a claim: one person, no dwelling, no division, no family, and
every one of those absences written as `reconstructed` with "Not attested" in its own
note. The division vocabulary gains `unplaced` for exactly this, because writing
`south` because most of the town was south is the kind of quiet invention this project
exists not to make.

THE EIGHT REFUSALS, AND WHY EACH ONE IS THERE.

  1. `garbled`                — the transcription bracketed the name as uncertain.
  2. `a firm, not a person`   — 'Hamilton & Sons'. A firm cannot head a household; it
                                is a BUSINESS, and the businesses are T-0263's.
  3. `first evidence after the scene date` — AGENTS.md rule 3.
  4. `no surname the corpus prints`.
  5. `a surname, a trade, and nothing else` — data/residents/index.json already
                                records this decision, under `darwin_of_canada`: a
                                real Chicago resident the project declined to write
                                because "a person record whose only content is one
                                clause of somebody else's sentence inflates the
                                documented count without adding evidence". A printed
                                name with no forename and no initial is that case.
  6. `placed where this project cannot put him in the town` — the gazetteer gives him
                                a place, and the place is not the town, one of the
                                committed streets, or a committed structure. 'Mouth of
                                the St. Joseph' and 'Green Bay' are how the corpus
                                names people who were somewhere else; 'Cook county' is
                                how it names people who may never have been in the
                                town at all. A Chicago street does NOT refuse — this
                                pass claims no location, so a street in a man's own
                                record is not contradicted by a household that says
                                nothing about where he lived.
  7. `the town already names a <Surname>` — a committed resident, or one of the
                                index's researched-not-resident findings, carries that
                                family name. Deliberately blunt: a wrongly refused
                                candidate costs the town one documented resident, a
                                wrongly accepted one mints a second copy of a real man
                                or answers a question the project has already opened.
  8. `surname already minted`  — one surname, one household, across the whole pass. A
                                shared surname reads as kinship and this pass claims
                                none; it is also how the same man under two printed
                                forms ('J. Bates' and 'Bates, J.') would take two.

WHY THE POOL READS `enrich` BACK.

The register is compiled FROM the committed town, so the moment this pass mints a man
the compiler stops calling him `new_resident` and starts calling him `enrich` — he is
in the town now, and it is right about that. Reading only `new_resident` would make
the pass unre-derivable the run after it lands. So an `enrich` whose target is one of
THIS pass's own person ids is read back into the pool as what it is: this pass's
previous answer.

WHAT THIS FILE WILL NOT DO. It will not invent an occupation, a dwelling, a division,
a sex or a family; it will not cite a claim the gazetteer does not carry; and it will
not upgrade a grade to make a record look better. The PERSON is `attested` — a source
names him and gives him his trade. Everything the household says about him beyond that
is written as unattested, because it is.

# pass's output either, and THAT is a precedence rule rather than the same rule
# twice: where two passes reach for one family name, the better-evidenced pass
# keeps it and the later one gives way.
#
# The order is documented (a trade the papers print) ▸ placed (a residency test
# over the corpus, T-0373) ▸ letter-list-only (a name on a list of uncalled-for
# letters, T-0378), best-evidenced first:
#
#   mint_documented_residents   skips hh_doc_, hh_placed_, hh_ll_ — sees none
#   mint_placed_residents       skips hh_placed_, hh_ll_         — sees hh_doc_
#   mint_letter_list_residents  skips hh_ll_                     — sees both

# of the three prefixes above — the prefix read as a household's STATUS ("placed"
# sounds like a lot position; it names a residency test) when it was only ever
# meant to say which pass minted the record. `source_pass` carries that instead.
# The ~747 households already minted under a legacy prefix are UNCHANGED by this
# — see `household_id()` — and stay that way until a dedicated migration renames
# them (tracked separately; this file does not do it).
#

# makes disjoint, not above it, so none of the three passes here should read its
# households as "the town already names a <Surname>". That test is a proxy for
# identity resolution over evidence that is a bare name, and the civic pass does
# not need the proxy — its identities come from the consolidation, which resolves
