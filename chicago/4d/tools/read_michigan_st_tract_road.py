WHAT IS DRAWN. On the 1834 Wright sheet, one road leaves the north bank of the Main
Branch a little east of Market Street, runs north-north-west across North Water Street
and Kinzie Street, bulges west, and ends inside the Michigan St tract at that tract's
Michigan Street. It is drawn as a DOUBLE LINE that curves, and it cuts diagonally across
platted blocks and lot lines - which is what tells it from a street. Apart from the fort's
road on the reservation it is the only such line on the sheet (T-1080, piece 2 of T-1075).

WHAT THE TRACE SETTLES, and it corrects the ticket's own premise. The road does NOT run
north THROUGH the tract. Both of its strokes stop inside the Michigan Street corridor,
short of that street's north rule, and the tract's north tier is ruled across with no road
in it. The road ENDS at Michigan Street.

THE METHOD is a ridge follower, not a row scan, because the road curves and crosses dozens
of ruled lines that a row scan cannot tell from it. From a stated seed on each stroke the
tracer steps STEP px along the current heading, searches +/-HALF px along the normal for
the darkest sample (bilinear), moves there, and re-estimates the heading from the last
three steps under a stated smoothing. Every parameter is committed below, so `--check-sheet`
re-runs the identical trace and `--check` re-derives every metre from the committed pixels
without opening the raster at all.

THE SEATING, and why it is not the tract's. The tract is seated 38 m north of where this
sheet's fit draws it (T-1079: Wright compresses y at his western margin, and the committed
Kinzie-to-Michigan span holds a block tier plus an 80 ft street where the fit's does not).
The road spans BOTH regimes: its southern two thirds lie in the North Division, where this
sheet's fit is good - the drawn rule that carries Kinzie's south side falls 3 m from the
committed line - and only its northern third lies inside the compressed tract. So the road
is seated with a correction that is ZERO at the Kinzie crossing and grows linearly, in the
sheet's own northing, to the tract's committed seating offset at Michigan Street. All of
Wright's compression is put where the project already says it is, and none of it is spread
over ground the sheet gets right.

THE TWO ENDS are carried onto the committed lines the road meets: 6.0 m north at the top, to
the centreline of `michigan_north_tract`, because the drawn strokes stop inside that street's
corridor; and 8.3 m back at the foot, because the drawn junction with the river bank falls
that far south of the committed `north_water`. Both runs are stated here and in the record.
