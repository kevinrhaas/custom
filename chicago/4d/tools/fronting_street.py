WHY THIS EXISTS.

`tools/replace_invented_residents.py` refused 27 documented tradesmen for one
reason: the papers say WHERE they were. J. K. Botsford advertised at the corner
of Dearborn and Lake, D. Graves baked on South Water Street, L. W. Montgomery
made boots on South Water. Every one practises a trade this town raised an
invented household for, and seating him on whichever reconstructed roof the deal
happened to reach would have contradicted the advertisement that names him.

What the deal could not do was ASK where a reconstructed roof stands. A
household's dwelling is a structure id, and the street it stands on lived in a
placement note in prose — in no field, readable by nothing. This module answers
the question from the committed geometry instead, so the frontage is a derivation
and not a claim anybody has to maintain by hand.

HOW THE ANSWER IS DERIVED — the plat first, the centreline only as a fallback.

**A roof on a platted lot fronts the street its lot faces.** That is not a
measurement, it is the plat: `data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json` divides
every block into a north and a south tier and names the four streets bounding
it, so a lot's tier IS its frontage. `plat_occupancy.lot_holders` says which lot
a footprint stands on, under the two tests that module already defends.

**A lot at the end of its tier also fronts the cross street it abuts** — the
westmost lot of a tier touches the block's west bounding street, the eastmost its
east one. It is reported as a SIDE frontage and kept distinct from the tier's
front, because the two are different claims: the lot's frontage is measured on
the tier face, and the cross street is the side the building shows to it. This is
what a corner address means; without it the plat could never answer 'Dearborn
Street' at all, since every tier in this grid faces an east–west street.

**A roof off the platted grid falls back to the centreline band.** The west and
north divisions hold reconstructed dwellings the Thompson lots do not reach. For
those, a roof fronts a street when its footprint centroid lies within
`FRONTAGE_BAND_M` of the platted centreline. 25 m is not a new number: it is the
band `tools/measure_street_frontage.py` already uses for 'on this street', set by
T-A13/T-A14 and quoted by every block parcel since. The platted corridor is
24.384 m wide, so the band reaches 12.8 m past the corridor edge — about a lot's
setback — and no further into the block. The two methods are reported separately
by `--all` and never merged into one number.

The drawn track is ignored throughout: `path_local_enu_m` is the platted line,
which is what every lot and corridor derivation in this project reads (see the
`_doc` in data/streets/1835.json).

RESOLVING A PRINTED PLACE TO A COMMITTED STREET.

`streets_named()` takes the gazetteer's `associated_places` prose and returns the
committed streets it names — and only those. It requires the word `street(s)`:
'Fort Dearborn' is not Dearborn Street, "Kinzie's Addition" is not Kinzie Street,
and neither resolves. 'Water Street' does not resolve either, because this scene
commits both a South Water and a North Water and the line does not say which; an
ambiguous reading is left unresolved rather than guessed. Streets the paper names
that this scene does not commit ('Main Street', 'Monroe Street') resolve to
nothing, which is the true answer: no roof in this model can front them.
