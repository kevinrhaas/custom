"""Re-derive the North Division tier's seven block-numeral crops from committed street lines.

T-1088, split out of T-0858. Wright writes a numeral across the middle of every
block of the Original Town. T-0788 read twenty-two of them by cutting each crop
from that block's OWN committed street lines — an identification made by the
georeference rather than by the reader's eye — and stopped, because the street
grid reached no further. It reaches further now: `data/streets/1835.json` holds
Kinzie Street and the six north-south lines of the North Division (Market,
Franklin, Wells, La Salle, Clark, Dearborn) and Wolcott closing the tier on the
east, all graded `attested`. So the tier between Kinzie Street and the river can
be cut, and it is: seven numerals, 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 running west to east.

WHAT THIS FILE IS. It is the DERIVATION of the crop boxes, not the reading. The
reading — which numeral stands in which block — lives in
`data/traces/thompson_block_numbering.json` § blocks_not_in_the_grid, one entry
per block, each citing the IIIF region it was read on. This tool recomputes those
regions from the committed street lines and fails if they have drifted, so the
citation stays a re-derivable statement about the georeference rather than a
number somebody once typed. It authors no ground: the North Division has no
generated block cell (tools/generate_plat_lots.py emits the three South Division
tiers and nothing else), which is exactly why the readings sit in the
not-in-the-grid section and wait there for a cell.

THE RULE, stated once so a reader can disagree with it:

  east and west   the two flanking north-south centrelines, at their south ends
  north           Kinzie Street's centreline, at whichever flank it runs lower
  south           the southern endpoint of the flanking streets — the point where
                  the platted line stops at the river — taking the northern of the
                  two so the box does not reach across the bank

Block 7 has no committed street on its west: its west edge is the North Branch.
Its box is therefore cut ONE MODULE west of Market Street, the module being the
mean spacing of the six flanking lines (123.36 m). That is a wider box than the
block, and it is cited as such; the numeral falls inside it and the entry records
the tighter region it was actually read on.

    tools/read_north_division_numerals.py            print the derivation
    tools/read_north_division_numerals.py --check    fail if the committed crops
                                                     are not what this re-derives
    tools/read_north_division_numerals.py --self-test  the check fires when broken
