"""Hold dated shoreline states apart and preserve source disagreement as a band.

This is a contract check, not a terrain generator.  It proves four things:

* 1812, 1835 and the 1880s resolve through their terrain epochs to three
  different shoreline-state ids;
* a state without its own trace does not borrow the active 1835 geometry while
  waiting for its own ticket, and a state that HAS one does not alias it either;
* every active geometry reference resolves to the named feature and source;
* the 1834/1849 comparison is the full polygon re-derived from the two committed
  readings, with no adopted midpoint hiding their disagreement; and
* the 1812 state re-derives exactly from `data/terrain/1812_mouth_readings.json`
  and the Wright 1834 trace, still carries no drafted pier vertex, and still
  adopts a reading rather than a midpoint between two.

# the third matched nothing in the data, because when T-1152 opened the 1880s
# state there was no decision yet to match and 1885-07-01 was a placeholder
# standing in for one.  A representative scene date is a sourced judgement --
# T-0473 argues 1888-07-01 from the Glessner completion spread, the 1871-1896
# stillness of the lakefront and the district's own build-out -- and a
# judgement belongs in the record beside its reasoning, where a reader meets it,
# rather than in a constant here that nothing argues for and nothing links.
# So the checker now resolves each epoch through the date its state declares,
