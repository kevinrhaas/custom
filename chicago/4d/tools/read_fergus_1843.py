"""Robert Fergus's *Directory of the City of Chicago, Illinois, for 1843* — read
entry by entry (T-0571).

`--build` reads the committed page text under
`data/research/directories/text/fergus_1843_page_00N.txt` and writes
`data/research/directories/claims/fergus_1843_directory_entries.json`.
`--check` rebuilds in memory and compares, so a hand-edit of the generated file
is caught the way `read_norris_1844.py` catches one; it also holds the per-page
counts declared in `coverage.json` to what the text actually yields, because a
declared page that quietly loses forty entries is exactly the hole coverage
exists to catch.

TWO SHAPES ON FOUR PAGES, and the segmenting rule is different for each because
the printer set them differently.

  Page 1, the BUSINESS DIRECTORY (lines 752-1204). Fergus groups these by trade
  under an ALL-CAPS heading and sets each card's subject in FULL CAPITALS at the
  head of its entry. So the heading is a line that shouts and ends in a stop, an
  entry begins where a line begins with a shouted name, and every other line is
  the turn of the entry above. The heading is carried onto the claim as
  `trade_heading`: it is the printer's own classification of the business and is
  worth more than anything a parser could infer from the prose.

  "Shouted" has to be defined carefully, because these cards list their partners
  and their eastern agents in the running prose and the transcription wraps them
  onto a line of their own: "J. R. Hall, Boston, agents", "W. Smith, Patrick
  Ballingall." both open a line with a capital. The head of a card is the leading
  run of tokens that are each an initial, an ampersand, or a word carrying two
  consecutive capitals — and it is a head only if at least one of those words
  does carry them. "C. McDONNELL" and "FREER & DeWOLF" are heads; "A. Rindge" and
  "J. Henry" are the middle of somebody's card.

  Pages 2-4, the ALPHABETICAL DIRECTORY. Fergus sets it in one alphabetical
  sequence broken by letter sections ("-A- Surnames", "H Surnames"). The web
  transcription this project holds wraps the long entries, and it does NOT
  indent the turn — so the indent trick that works for Norris is unavailable.
  The rule here is the directory's own organising principle instead: an entry
  begins where a line begins with a surname IN THE CURRENT LETTER SECTION. A
  turned line that opens with a capital opens with a place or a date — "Ill.,
  Nov. 25,1893, a. 80. ]" under A, "Feb. 22,1862" under B — and its initial is
  not the section's. Where the capital IS the section's letter and the head
  carries no comma, the entry grammar is absent too, and alphabetical order
  decides: `Cass` arriving after `Clarke & Co.` is the tail of that firm's
  address, not a new name.

  Seven times on page 2 the transcription runs a new entry onto the same line as
  the tail of the one before — "aged 84-6. Ballantine, David (B. & Sherman), ..."
  Those are cut mid-line and located with `spans`, which is what `spans` is for.

1843 IS EIGHT YEARS LATE, and Fergus compiled it in 1896 out of the 1844 canvass.
Nothing here is an 1835 fact. Every claim carries `describes_date: "1843"`, and
the crosswalk is the only place a name in this volume may touch a person standing
in the scene of 1 July 1835.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# T-0987 stretch 12 — THE SEPARATOR THE COMPOSITOR SET AS A POINT.
#
# `split_entry` closes the surname at the first comma, because that is the format
# Fergus sets: `Surname, Given, trade, address`. Where the comma is not there the
# head runs on, and the surname this reading hands the crosswalk is not a surname
# at all — `Boyington. Charles H`, `Cook. George`, `Harding Charles`. The
# crosswalk reaches an 1835 person through the surname and nothing else, so a
# surname like that makes NO match and NO refusal: the entry leaves no trace in
# any pool this ticket counts. That is a hole in the denominator, and stretches 10
# and 11 measured the same hole in Norris 1844.
#
# TWENTY-SIX person entries in this volume carry a space inside their surname and
# are neither an institution, a real two-word name, nor the page-citation run-on
# class (`84-5-6] Cutmore`, six of them, a different defect and not this one).
# Twenty-five are repaired below and one is left alone.
#
# THE SECOND HAND. The committed text of this domain is K. Torp's 2007
# transcription on Genealogy Trails. This repository ALSO holds, under
# `data/research/books/text/fergus_26_29.txt`, the Internet Archive's own OCR of
# the printed volume — Fergus' Historical Series Nos. 26-29 bound in one, of which
# No. 28 IS this directory (source record `fergus_historical_series_26_29`). Two
# independent extractions of one printing, and neither was made from the other.
# Every row below carries what that second hand prints, verbatim with its own
# damage, so the comparison can be run again.
#
# WHAT THE TWO HANDS SAID, and the confidence follows it and is not chosen:
#
#   5  the printed volume sets a COMMA where this transcription sets a point
#      (Boyington, Goodwin, Graff, Houfe, Tarbox). The separator is DOCUMENTED:
#      the volume prints it, and Torp's point is this transcription's damage.
#   2  the printed volume sets a COMMA where this transcription sets NOTHING
#      (Harding, Seger). Also DOCUMENTED, and these two are the whole of the
#      no-separator class.
#  18  BOTH hands read a point. The surname is DOCUMENTED — two readings agree on
#      the letters — but that the point stands where the format sets a comma is
#      INFERRED, and the reason is stretch 10's and is stated again here: a
#      surname is never abbreviated, so a stop immediately after one cannot be an
#      abbreviation point. The five rows above are the corroboration that reading
#      had lacked: in five places out of twenty-three the second hand reads the
#      comma outright, so the point is a defect class in this printing and not a
#      punctuation Fergus chose.
#
# THE REPAIR MOVES THE READING ONLY. `quote` and `as_printed` keep the damage —
# a tidied quote cannot be found again — and every repaired claim states both
# readings in `normalized.surname_repair`. `--self-test` fails if a row stops
# matching exactly one entry, if a repaired entry stops reading its surname, or if
# a repair tidied a quote.
