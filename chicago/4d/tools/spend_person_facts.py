"""The candidate-fact table, and the spend of the facts it asserts — T-1232.

WHAT WAS WRONG. The resident layer had spent years of reading into `resident_research`
blocks and then left the findings there, in prose. 94 of those blocks carry an ASSERTED
IDENTITY — the project's own verdict that the person behind the research is the person on
the card — and inside their summaries sat dated arrivals, origins, marriages, deaths,
expansions of initials and departures that the structured fields beside them still read as
null. `hh_andrus_thomas` is the whole defect in one record: the DuPage history gives
"arrival in Chicago Dec. 1, 1833", and the card's `origin` says "Not attested."

A fact that exists only in a paragraph is a fact no query can reach, no gate can hold and no
later ticket can fill a family from. This tool turns each of them into a ROW.

THE TABLE IS THE PRODUCT, NOT THE SPEND. Most rows are withheld, and that is the point.
Three standing rulings do the withholding and none of them is this tool's to overturn:

  later_only          T-0513's ladder, applied by T-0514/T-0515: a volume printed after
                      1 July 1835 may date and corroborate and may NEVER promote. A birth
                      year arithmetic'd out of an 1871 death notice is a real reading and
                      is not an 1835 fact.
  outside_chicago     A source that puts the person somewhere else. Paul Kingston left for
                      Racine on 2 January 1835; that is why his presence cannot be lifted,
                      and writing it down is what makes the grade legible.
  contradicted        Two readings that disagree — including a volume that disagrees with
                      itself, which Fergus 26-29 does about where John S. C. Hogan died.
  insufficient_identity   A surname-only agreement, or a name too common to tie.
  unresolved:T-NNNN   The fact belongs to a field another ticket is building. A trade is
                      T-1145's plural roles; a premises is T-1147's location spend.
  duplicate           The record already holds the value; the row records which source it
                      rests on, which is often more than the record could say before.
  no_candidate        The block proposes nothing to adjudicate — either the consolidation's
                      "confirmed, not moved" verdict on an identity, or a documented no-find.
                      It is NOT a finding that the person did not exist, and it is listed
                      rather than skipped so the table can prove every block was read.
  asserted            Written onto the record, with its source, its date and its reason.

NOTHING HERE MINTS A PERSON. A marriage names a spouse and a chronology names a travelling
companion; neither becomes a household member. T-1170 fills families, from exactly these
rows, under the household model. T-1146 acceptance 4 is the rule and this tool obeys it by
having no code that can create one.
