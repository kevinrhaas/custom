"""Rule on every lead volume 1 of the Newberry index offered — T-0590.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `tools/measure_research_spend.py` measured `newberry_index` on
2026-09-03 at 2,619 units read and 0 ruled on: the project's largest unspent
read. The owner's finding, in his words: "i see lots of research being done and
some apparent findings from parsing but there are not outputs or updates to the
household and resident data it seems, should i be concerned?" `leads.json` held
319 questions already framed against the residents, the civic lists, the 1840
heads and the structures, and nothing had answered one of them.

A ruling is the deliverable; a merge is not the quota. `census_1840/crosswalk.json`
states the standard: "A refusal is declared as explicitly as a merge - the absence
of one reads like a pair nobody has looked at yet." So every lead is ruled, and
every ruling is ANCHORED - to the card it stands on, and to the person in the town
it reaches where it reaches one.

WHAT A CARD CAN AND CANNOT DO. A Newberry card heads a family surname and names
the printed work that treats that family in a locality. It carries no forename,
no date about a person and no place beyond the locality of the book. So the
ladder below can never reach a merge on a card alone, and `read_newberry_index.py
--check` enforces exactly that on crosswalk.json. This file does not weaken it:
it says, one card at a time, WHY not - and separates the leads whose answer is
already on the shelf from the ones that need a book nobody here has.

THE LADDER, in order. The first test a lead fails decides it.

  1 ocr_variant_only      No candidate reached this heading by an exact surname
                          key - every one of them came through the OCR-similarity
                          window. The heading is not certainly that surname at
                          all, so the pair is refused twice over. This is the
                          `Beeubion` / `Jean Baptiste Beaubien` case already
                          written out by hand in crosswalk.json.
  2 locality_absent       Every card under this heading names Illinois only -
                          no Chicago, no Cook County. The lead stands on a
                          surname with the locality actively absent.
  3 discriminator_found   A card carries a token that is a candidate's FORENAME.
                          This would be the one thing that could lift a lead off
                          the surname, so it is tested rather than assumed. It is
                          never an automatic merge: it is raised for a hand
                          ruling. Volume 1 yields none, and the count is printed
                          so a later volume that does yield one cannot pass
                          quietly.
  4 testable_in_a_held_work
                          A Chicago or Cook County card, on an exact surname,
                          citing a work THIS PROJECT ALREADY HOLDS (Andreas, or
                          the 1839 directory). Outcome `candidate`: plausible,
                          insufficient, and answerable without acquiring
                          anything. This is the reading list.
  5 surname_only_chicago  A Chicago or Cook County card on an exact surname,
                          citing a work nobody here holds, or no work the
                          citation table could read. Refused, and the work it
                          waits on is named.

WHAT IS COUNTED. `measure_research_spend.py` dedupes a domain's rulings by their
anchor, so the spend of this file is the number of DISTINCT CARDS ruled on, not
the number of leads: 319 leads stand on 542 distinct cards, and each card gets
one ruling naming every lead it stands under. `lead_rulings` carries the per-lead
verdict the ticket asks for and is deliberately not an adjudication key, so the
same work is not counted twice.

    tools/rule_newberry_leads.py --write       write the rulings
    tools/rule_newberry_leads.py --check       re-derive and compare
    tools/rule_newberry_leads.py --self-test   prove the assertions fire
