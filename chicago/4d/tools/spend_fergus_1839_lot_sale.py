"""Fergus 1839's Fort Dearborn Addition lot sale, spent on the people it names (T-0681).

    python3 tools/spend_fergus_1839_lot_sale.py             write the ledger and the cards
    python3 tools/spend_fergus_1839_lot_sale.py --check     everything re-derives; nothing drifted
    python3 tools/spend_fergus_1839_lot_sale.py --report    person by person, what they bid on
    python3 tools/spend_fergus_1839_lot_sale.py --self-test the rules below, held over what it derives

WHY THIS EXISTS. T-0666 (PR #791) read the Fort Dearborn Addition lot sale of 10-24 June
1839 out of Fergus' Chicago Directory for 1839 — printed pages 47-49, 100 distinct bidders
— and crosswalked them against the town. Eleven bidders match a person this project holds a
card for. Not one of those eleven cards was told what the sale says about them, and three
of the eleven named a card that cited nothing the ruling rests on at all.

That three is not an estimate: `tools/research_spend_baseline.json` carries it as the
directories domain's write-hop ceiling, raised by T-0635 with the sentence "The number is 3,
it is T-0666's to pay, and T-0681 is filed to pay it… The ceiling comes back down to 0 when
T-0681 lands." This is that pass, and it pays EVERY match rather than the visible three: a
card that cites the volume only because Fergus' 1837 poll or its 1839 city register happened
to name the same household reads as written to the second hop while the lot sale itself has
reached nobody.

THE COUNT IS THE CROSSWALK'S, NOT THIS FILE'S. T-0685 (PR #935) settled four more bidders
while this pass was being written and the matches went from eleven to fifteen; the pass
picked them up on its next run because it reads `residents.matches` and holds no list of its
own. No number here is hard-coded, and `--check` re-derives the ledger from the crosswalk
rather than comparing it to a total somebody wrote down.

A SEPARATE PASS, NOT AN EXTENSION OF THE LATER-LISTS ONE, and the reason is the paragraph
already on those eight cards. `tools/spend_fergus_1839_later_lists.py` writes one paragraph
per person naming the two lists it reads; folding a third list into it would mean rewriting
101 paragraphs that are already correct about what they say, to add a sentence that is true
of eleven of them. Every previous pass in this series — civic, the later lists, the land
tract sales, the directories — is its own tool, its own ledger and its own marker, and this
one keeps that shape. A card met by two passes carries two paragraphs, each saying what its
own source says.

THE FOUR RULES, unchanged from passes 1-3 because the defect they guard against is the same.

  1. ONLY WHAT THE CROSSWALK ALREADY DECLARED. This pass re-adjudicates nothing. It reads
     `residents.matches` and writes exactly those. The `contested` and `ambiguous` rows
     are rivals still standing; the surname-only rows are refusals; and the voter,
     letter-list and 1840-head pools match a row in another reading rather than a card in
     this town, so there is nothing to write them onto.

  2. TWO FIELDS AND NO OTHERS. A person gains the source id in `sources` and a paragraph in
     `note`. Not a grade, not an arrival, not a claim block, not a placement, and above all
     not `lives_at` — see rule 3. `--self-test` holds it by diffing a record through the
     applier and asserting the changed key set.

  3. THE LOT IS NOT A LOCATION, and the crosswalk says so itself: the Fort Dearborn
     Addition is the Beaubien, or Reservation, lands, which in July 1835 were the garrison's
     ground and were not platted into lots at all. A block and a lot number from this sale
     place no house, no shop and no household in the town this project builds. That sentence
     travels onto every card this pass writes, quoted rather than paraphrased.

  4. NO GRADE MOVES. A sale four years after the scene date is a second source about
     CONTINUED RESIDENCE, not about July 1835. T-0515 applies the ratified ladder against
     every source at once; this pass hands it the evidence and not the verdict.

THE LEDGER IS NOT A CROSSWALK, deliberately, and for the reason pass 1 gave:
`data/research/directories/fergus_1839_lot_sale_spend_1835.json` carries no "crosswalk" in
its name so that `measure_research_spend.py` does not read a record of WRITES as a second
adjudication and report the pass grading its own homework.
