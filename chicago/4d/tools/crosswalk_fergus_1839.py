"""Fergus' 1839 directory against the four pools of 1835 names (T-0506).

The ONLY place a name in the 1839 directory is allowed to touch a person standing
in the scene of 1 July 1835. It touches them as CORROBORATION and as CANDIDATE
ENRICHMENT, never as an 1835 fact: under the ratified grading ladder a later
listing alone never makes an 1835 resident, and NOTHING HERE MINTS OR REGRADES
ANYBODY. The file this writes is a proposal for the passes that spend it —
T-0513 consolidates it, T-0514 and T-0515 are the ones allowed to write people.

The rule, written out so it reads back without the code:
  SURNAME must match after both are folded (case, punctuation and the
  transcriber's usual confusions removed), AND the first initial of the given
  name must match. A surname-only agreement is a REFUSAL, however good it looks —
  this directory lists forty-one Smiths. Where one 1835 name meets more than one
  1839 entry on that rule the match is AMBIGUOUS and is filed as such, not
  resolved; where two 1835 people meet one 1839 entry it is CONTESTED and no match
  is made.

FOUR POOLS, because the ticket asks for four and they are not the same object.
The residents layer is the town as it stands, and a match there is enrichment of a
record that already exists. The voter, poll and tax entries (T-0493), the
letter-list and newspaper persons, and the 1840 heads are LISTS OF NAMES, and a
match there is one more line of evidence about a name the project has not yet
made into a person. They are counted separately and never mixed.

WHAT THIS DIRECTORY WILL NOT GIVE, however well a name matches: an address. Fergus
prints on page 3 that no street but Lake carried numbers in 1839 and that "the
numbers now given are those of the present day" — 1876's. The street NAME crosses;
the number does not, and `address_is_street_only` says which rows are which.

T-0670'S FORENAME RULE, AND WHY IT TOO READS ONE POOL OF THE FOUR. Where BOTH
readings print a full forename and the two disagree, the match is REFUSED and the
refusal is filed — tools/name_agreement.py is the rule, imported rather than
restated. It is applied to the RESIDENTS pool, where a false match writes a trade
onto a person's card, and not to the three lists of names, which mint nobody here
and are consumed by spend passes of their own whose ties are theirs to re-derive;
`forename_rule_scope` below says so on the file. Running it matters most for the
ties: an 1839 line whose own forename contradicts the 1835 name was standing in
the tie pool, and a discriminator weighing that line can name it.

THE TIE DISCRIMINATOR (T-0696), AND WHY IT READS ONE POOL OF THE FOUR. A trade may
NARROW a tie and never make it a match; a premises and a year may not. The rule is
tools/tiebreak.py and it is run here over the RESIDENTS pool only — not because
that pool is the interesting one, but because a discriminator needs a trade on the
1835 side of the tie and the residents layer is the only one of the four pools that
holds one. The voter and poll lists, the letter-list persons and the 1840 heads are
lists of NAMES: there is nothing on their side to narrow on, so their ties stand by
the construction of the pool rather than by a ruling, and `discriminator_scope`
below says so on the file.
