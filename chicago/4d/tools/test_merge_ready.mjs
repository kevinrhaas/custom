/**
 * test_merge_ready.mjs — the thing that merges a finished pull request, tested
 * in the states that actually kept this repository's queue from draining.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-14 the PR lap was fixed twice — it could not SEE
 * its pull requests (GraphQL budget), then it gated for ~7 minutes per PR
 * against merges landing every few minutes — and after both fixes the queue
 * still did not drain, because NOTHING MERGED A FINISHED PULL REQUEST. Three
 * pieces each assumed one of the others did it:
 *
 *   pr-lap.sh header       "auto-merge does that once `gate` goes green"
 *   steward-janitor.yml    "`custom` merges through the lap plus auto-merge"
 *                          — while deliberately excluding `custom` from itself
 *   chicago-4d-bake.yml    the ONLY `gh pr merge --auto` in the repo, on bakes
 *
 * Measured the same day: #1327 and #1312 both merged with `auto_merge: off`.
 * Auto-merge was armed by hand or not at all.
 *
 * THE SCRIPT IS NOT COPIED HERE. Each case runs the REAL
 * `.github/steward/merge-ready.sh` with `gh` faked on PATH, so a change that
 * makes it merge something it should not fails here rather than on `dev`.
