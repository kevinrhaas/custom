THE HOLE THIS CLOSES. Wright's legend is nine coloured chips, each naming a survey
tract and most of them a date, and it is the only place on any sheet in this project
that says WHO SURVEYED WHAT GROUND AND WHEN. T-0792 asks for nine tract polygons off
those colours. Nothing had ever measured the chips. Three open tickets — T-0792 itself,
T-0796 on the Michigan St tract, T-1082 on the wash between Wright's bank shading and
his inked bank line — all say some form of "read it against the legend's swatches", and
none of them could, because the swatches had no committed colour, no pixel box and no
statement of how far apart they are.

WHAT THIS READS, AND IN WHAT ORDER OF CONFIDENCE.

  the chips        Nine boxes located on the NA/HUP raster by their own darkness against
                   the paper, each chip's interior sampled with its inked border eroded
                   away: median, mean and per-channel standard deviation, and the count.
                   This is a measurement of the raster and nothing else, and it is the
                   only `documented` claim here.
  the separation   The distance between every pair of chip medians, against the spread
                   INSIDE a chip. This is arithmetic on the measurement.
  the bands        Where each separable colour appears on the sheet: pixels near a class
                   colour, thinned to the broad boundary bands by requiring a cell of
                   8x8 px to be at least 45 % covered, then joined into components. A
                   band is evidence about the raster; naming the ground under it is not,
                   and the naming lives in docs/RESEARCH/wright_1834_legend_swatches.md
                   where it can be argued with.

THE RESULT THAT MATTERS, and it is a refusal. The nine chips do not carry nine
separable colours. Chips 3 (Wabansia) and 7 (Fractional Section 15) differ by 10 RGB
units; chips 4, 6 and 9 (Kinzie's Addition, the unnamed 1833 survey, Part of Canal
Section 9) lie within 30 of each other; and the per-pixel spread inside a single chip is
30 to 60 units per channel. So a pixel of wash on the sheet cannot be assigned to a chip
— only to a CLASS of chips. T-0792 asks for the two ambiguous swatches to be read "by
matching swatch to ground on the sheet"; measured, that method cannot do it, and saying
so is worth more than a confident wrong answer. What is left is position: inside a class
whose other members are named ground, the band that is not on named ground is the
unnamed chip's. That argument is piece 2's to make with polygons.

WHY THE NA/HUP SHEET AND NOT THE BPL ONE. The chips are a centimetre of paper; at 600
dpi they are 54 px wide and at the BPL scan's resolution they would be half that. The
local metres printed beside every band come from the committed NA/HUP affine
(`data/traces/gcp/wright_1834_nara_hup_gcps.json`), whose own y scale is under challenge
in T-0878 — so they are stated as INDICATIVE, to say which part of town a band is in,
and nothing in this file is geometry anything else may stand on.
