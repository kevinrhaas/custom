WHAT IS READ. Two pages of genealogytrails.com/ill/cook, both printing the first Chicago
Catholic church register out of the *Illinois Catholic Historical Review*, vol. 4 (July
1921 - April 1922): `marriages_catholic.txt`, the marriage register with the article's
commentary around it, and `church_catholicdeaths.txt`, the death and burial page. Nobody
in this project has seen the register, and nobody here has seen the Review either: the
reading is `transcription_mediated` twice over on every row.

THE COUNT THE TICKET CARRIED WAS WRONG, AND THE PAGE SAYS SO ITSELF. T-0573 was written
against "87 marriages of 1834-1839". The page carries 128. Eighty-seven is Father
O'Meara's SUBTOTAL, printed in the article's own tally near the foot of the page:

    Rev. John Mary Iranaeus St. Cyr, baptisms, 46; marriages, 22. Rev. Bernard Schaeffer,
    baptisms, 31; marriages, 18. Rev. Timothy O'Meara, baptisms, 195; marriages, 87.
    Besides these officiating clergymen there were 6 baptisms and 1 marriage by John F.
    Plunkett...

22 + 18 + 87 + 1 = 128, and this parse independently returns exactly 22 St. Cyr, 18
Schaeffer, 87 O'Meara and 1 Plunkett. That agreement is the strongest check available on
a list nobody can re-count against the book, so it is an ASSERTION here and not a remark:
`--check` fails if any of the four moves. The per-year figures the ticket carried (1836:8,
1837:36, 1838:21, 1839:12) were wrong for the same reason and the true ones are 1834:4,
1835:6, 1836:11, 1837:50, 1838:36, 1839:21.

NAMES ARE PEOPLE, which is `data/research/church/README.md`'s rule and the reason a row
here is a PERSON and not a marriage. An entry naming a groom, a bride and two witnesses
carries four readings. The 128 entries carry 513 named readings, and the entry-level
structure is kept beside them in `entries` so the marriage is not lost in the process.
The officiating priest is NOT one of the readings: he is the recorder, he is carried in
every row's `cells.priest`, and his own dates are a claim rather than a row.

TRAP 1, THE ONE THAT WOULD PLANT THREE HOUSEHOLDS IN THE WRONG TOWN. This page is titled
"First Chicago Marriage Records" and it is NOT all Chicago. Footnote 5 hangs off the third
of three May 1834 entries and reads: "They all (the last three couples) were married in
the home of Hy Durbin in the presence of several witnesses, Bear Creek, Sangamon County,
Illinois." The article's closing prose says the same thing again. So entries 2, 3 and 4
carry `place: "Bear Creek, Sangamon County, Illinois"` and `at_chicago: false` ON THE ROW
ITSELF — twelve readings of eight people who were never in this town on that day — and
the gate fails if that count moves. Entry 1 (N. Murphy and Mrs. M. Frauner) is Chicago:
the article names it as the first marriage St. Cyr performed here.

TRAP 2, THE BOURASSA PAIR. `Mark Bourassa` marries Josette Chevalier in March 1835 on the
marriage page; `Leon Bourrassa` buries a 28-day-old son on 2 July 1835 on the death page.
The ticket forbids joining them without a stated rule. They are NOT joined: the surnames
do not even fold equal (`bourassa` against `bourrassa`) and the forenames are different
names, not spellings of one. The refusal is written out in `crosswalk.json`, because an
absent merge and an unexamined pair look identical from the outside.

THE CROSSWALK. Only the SCENE-YEAR entries are crosswalked — the 1835 marriages and the
1835 deaths — against the named persons of `data/residents/`. The rule: surnames must
fold equal (case, punctuation, apostrophes), AND forenames must agree initial for initial
in one direction or the other. Surname-only agreement is a REFUSAL however good it looks.
Everything the rule reaches is a CANDIDATE, and a candidate becomes a merge only when a
second attribute agrees as well; that happened exactly once, for Thomas Owen.

THE LADDER, ratified 2026-09-03. A source later than 1835 never mints an 1835 resident on
its own. Most of this page is later than 1835 — 118 of the 128 entries are 1836-1839 —
and nothing here creates a resident. It corroborates, it enriches, and above all it DATES:
every row carries `describes_date`.
