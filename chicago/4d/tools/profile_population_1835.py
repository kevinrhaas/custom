"""The known population of 1 July 1835, profiled per attribute and per tier.

T-1160. The owner, 2026-09-17: *"do a population analysis of the known population
… analyze demographics, gender, age, occupations, arrival date and reason, all the
attributes for all members of all households and descriptions of the population
composition and types so we can make a best profile of the town."*

`tools/summarize_residents.py` (T-0517) is the older profile and this EXTENDS it
rather than forking it: the layer loader, the markdown table printer and the
percentage helper are imported from there, so a change to how a household is read
moves both. What this adds is the axes that one lacks — age, origin, arrival,
reason for coming, plural roles, lodging and community — and a TIER on every row,
because the reconstruction bands below (T-1167 onward) need to see exactly what
they are filling in and at what honesty.

    python3 tools/profile_population_1835.py              # every section
    python3 tools/profile_population_1835.py sex age      # two sections
    python3 tools/profile_population_1835.py --list       # the section names
    python3 tools/profile_population_1835.py --build      # write the report + JSON
    python3 tools/profile_population_1835.py --check      # re-derive both, byte for byte
    python3 tools/profile_population_1835.py --self-test  # break each rule, require it to fire
    python3 tools/profile_population_1835.py --write-vocabulary   # the two vocabularies

IT IS A PROFILE OF THE EVIDENCE, NOT OF THE TOWN. The town census of November 1835
counts 3,265 people; this layer holds 1,282 person entries and most of them are a
name on a post-office return and nothing else. Every table below says how thin its
own axis is, and the closing section names the buckets the MODEL tickets (T-1293)
and the reconstruction bands have to supply. Nothing here reconstructs anybody — and
the `reconstructed` tier is counted rather than assumed away, which is how the twelve
attribute values already standing at that tier came out of a layer whose person grade
reads zero reconstructed.

THE TWO JUDGEMENTS, both made once and both auditable:

  * `SEX_RULES` — how a name may imply a sex. A recorded `sex` wins; then a gendered
    TITLE (Mrs/Miss/Widow/Mr); then a forename that stands in exactly one sex's pool
    of `data/reconstruction/1835_invented_name_pools.json`. Ranks and professional
    styles (Capt., Rev., Dr.) are deliberately NOT read as male: they would be an
    inference about the period rather than about the person, and the age axis already
    takes the honest half of that reading.
  * `REASON_RULES` — the phrase in a household's stated `reason_for_coming` that
    puts it under a controlled term. An unmatched reason is REFUSED rather than
    bucketed as "other", so a new reason cannot fall silently through the axis.
