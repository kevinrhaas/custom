"""The closing research audit: the T-1143 ledger read over the four town layers (T-1241).

WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHAT IT IS NOT. `research_spend_ledger.py` accounts for research from
the SOURCE side: every registered reading unit gets one durable disposition, and the gate
refuses an unclassified one. That is a complete answer to "what did we read, and what did
we rule about it" and no answer at all to "what did the town end up carrying". A ledger at
zero unclassified units is compatible with a town whose businesses have no proprietors and
whose roofs have no occupants, because those are two different books.

This is the other book. It reads the ledger's asserted units onto the layers they land in,
then reads the layers themselves, and prints the two beside each other so a gap is visible
as a gap rather than as a silence. T-1157 signs the research spend off; this is the
evidence section it reads, and it makes NO GO/NO-GO judgement of its own.

A STATED GAP IS A FINISHED ANSWER. The bar here is not that every number is large. It is
that every number is DERIVED — nothing in the report below is typed — and that the
report says plainly where the research stopped. Section 7 exists to be read, not to be
driven to zero.

`--build` writes the report; `--check` re-derives it and refuses a drifted one, which is
how tools/check.sh consumes it; `--self-test` mutates the measurement and proves the check
fires.
