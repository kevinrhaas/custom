WHY THIS EXISTS. `tools/measure_research_spend.py` asks two questions of this project's
research. The first is whether what was READ was ever RULED ON. The second — the one the
owner actually asked on 2026-09-03, "there are not outputs or updates to the household and
resident data" — is whether a ruling that names a person in this town ever reached that
PERSON'S CARD. Measured on dev the morning of 2026-09-04, the civic domain answered:

    civic   99 reached, 99 judgeable, 0 on a card, 99 unwritten

Ninety-nine adjudicated matches between the four early Chicago lists and the residents
layer, and not one of the ninety-nine had put a source on the record it named. The
adjudication happened in `data/research/civic/voter_crosswalk.json` and stopped there.
This pass is the hop, and it is the whole of what T-0634 asks for: write what is already
ruled onto the card it names, and measure the difference.

THE FOUR LISTS, and what each is. They are the town's own paper, not a recollection of it:
the poll list of the first election of the Board of Trustees of the Town of Chicago,
10 August 1833; the tax list of the Town of Chicago, 1833; the poll list of the 1834
election, filed 11 August 1834; and the 1835 poll list. This project has never seen the
IRAD originals — the reading is twice mediated, Schulz's transcription and Genealogy
Trails' republication of it — and every record here says so.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT WRITTEN, in four rules.

  1. ONLY WHAT THE CROSSWALK ALREADY DECLARED. This pass re-adjudicates nothing. It reads
     `outcome: "matched"` rows and writes those; a `candidate` row is a rival still
     standing and writes nothing, and an `unmatched` row names nobody. The pass is
     therefore reversible from the crosswalk in both directions, and re-running it after
     a re-adjudication moves exactly the rows the re-adjudication moved.

  2. TWO FIELDS AND NO OTHERS. A person gains the source id in `sources` and a paragraph
     in `note`. Nothing else on the record is touched — not a grade, not an arrival, not
     a claim block, not a placement. `--self-test` holds that by diffing a record through
     the applier and asserting the changed key set.

  3. NO GRADE MOVES, and this is the rule the ratified ladder forces. Under it (T-0513)
     "attested = 1835 poll + any second independent source ... inferred = 1835 poll alone,
     or 1833/1834 lists with another source". A pass that both wrote the evidence and
     re-read the ladder off it would be grading itself; the ladder is applied by T-0515,
     against every source at once, and this pass hands it the evidence rather than the
     verdict. The count of grades this pass changes is zero and `--check` holds it there.

  4. ONE PARAGRAPH PER PERSON, NOT PER ENTRY. Fifty-five people carry the ninety-nine
     matches between them — Philo Carpenter stands on three of the four rolls — and a
     card that said the same thing three times would be harder to read, not better
     evidenced. Every list that names the person is named in the one paragraph, with the
     line as printed and the record id it was read into, so nothing is lost by the fold.

THE LEDGER IS NOT A CROSSWALK, deliberately. `data/research/civic/voter_spend_1835.json`
records what this pass did, and it is named so that `measure_research_spend.py` does NOT
read it as an adjudication: that instrument counts any file with "crosswalk" in its name,
and a ledger of writes counted as rulings would report fifty-five new rulings reaching a
person and fifty-five of them written — the pass grading its own homework and inflating
both columns of the very measurement it exists to move. The adjudication is
`voter_crosswalk.json` and remains the only one.
