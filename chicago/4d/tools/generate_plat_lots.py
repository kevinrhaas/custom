"""Generate the platted block and lot grid from the module, not from a trace.

ROADMAP K7. The 1830 Thompson plat is a PARAMETER source in this dataset — no open
high-resolution scan of it exists and the surviving artifact is a Canal Commissioners'
working copy — so its geometry is generated analytically from the module it fixes
(80-ft streets, 18-ft alleys) and snapped to the street lines this project has already
committed. Tracing the 1834 sheets instead would bake their 3.7-4.5% anisotropic paper
stretch into every block face: the corridors those draughtsmen drew run about 5 ft wide
of 80 on both sheets, which is stretch and pen placement rather than a wider street.

What each part of the output is entitled to claim, and why:

* A **block boundary** is a street centreline offset by half the platted corridor. The
  centrelines are `data/streets/1835.json`, whose own geometry confidence is `inferred`,
  and the half-width is the module. Arithmetic on inferred inputs is inferred, so that is
  what the block edges carry.
* A **lot line** is `conjectural` and stays that way. Four lots to a block face is read
  off the owner's crop of Wright's sheet at the Clark reach — block 18's north row runs
  4 3 2 and its south row 5 6 7 (`docs/RESEARCH/clark_reach_bulge_1834.md` § 8) — and a
  reading of ONE block does not document the subdivision of the other seventeen. The
  alley is worse off: 18 ft is the module, but nothing in `data/sources/` says which
  blocks were alleyed or where the alley ran inside them.
* A block is emitted only where the committed centrelines of all four of its bounding
  streets actually REACH it. Extending a street line past where this project has drawn it
  would be an invention dressed as geometry, so those blocks are listed in `omitted` with
  the street that falls short — which is the same list as the street control still owed
  under ROADMAP § S9.

Thompson's block NUMBERS reach six blocks of this grid and no more. The owner's crop
carries two numerals side by side in the South Water tier — 19 west of 18, the stream in
the La Salle corridor between them — and that fixes the step (one per block) and the
direction (falling eastward) along a row. Counting along that row numbers the tier's six
blocks, and block 16 lands on Dearborn-State, where G. Spring's 'LOT No. 7, in block No.
16 ... on Lake street' and the Mansion House's own Andreas-and-Botsford placement already
agree it should. Nothing outside the tier is numbered: how the run passes from one row to
the next is not readable from two numerals in one row. The judgement, the identification
and the refusals live in `data/traces/thompson_block_numbering.json`; this module only
stamps them. Block ids stay named for the streets that bound them, which is a description
that never goes wrong.

# T-1191. A CORRIDOR IS NOT A BLOCK, and until 2026-09-19 this file could not say so:
# one pair of lists decided both which streets a block may be cut between AND which
# streets a building may be reported standing in, so the north bank had neither. That
# is why `plat_corridors.corridors()` returned nothing north of the river and why the
# comment above used to give the block rule as the reason for the corridor gap.
#
# The two questions have different evidence bars. Cutting a block needs BOTH bounding
# lines fixed and the ground between them read. Asking whether a point is in a platted
# roadway needs only that one street's own corridor be read off a sheet — which the
# north bank's are, and have been since T-0451 and T-1060:
#
#   * the Thompson North Division tier — the plat letters the figure 80 at the head of
#     every one of its six corridors, on the Kinzie line, and nothing else
#     (`data/traces/thompson_north_division_streets.json` § lettering); the same sheet's
#     own fit returns an 80 ft corridor as 45.6 px = 24.4 m against the platted 24.384
#     (`docs/RESEARCH/north_division_streets.md` § 3);
#   * Kinzie's Addition — 22.17 m, read corridor by corridor off Wright's 1834 survey
#     and scaled against the Original Town's corridors on the same sheet
#     (`data/traces/kinzie_addition_street_grid.json` § control_summary).
#
# Each record carries its own `corridor_width_m` and this module uses it, because the
# Addition's corridor is 2.2 m narrower than the Original Town's and one town-wide
# half-width would have drawn the Addition's roadways over its own lot lines.
#
# NORTH WATER STREET IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN THE LAYER, and neither is Wabansia, and
# the control file says so in its own `not_in_the_corridor_layer` block with the
# reason per street. The short of it: North Water's line is cut from the river bank
# rather than from a platted rule, so offsetting it by half a module would invent a

# ------------------------------------------------------------- the seated tracts
#
# T-1454. A THIRD KIND OF GRID, and it exists because the two above cannot reach it.
# `grids()` cuts a cell between four committed street CENTRELINES and that is the whole
# of what it can do. The Michigan Street tract north of Kinzie Street and Wabansia on
# the North Branch are each ruled by lines this project has never committed as streets —
# the tract's own borders and its mid-block alleys, Wabansia's three block columns and
# its own west margin — so neither has ever carried a block in this file, let alone a
# lot, and every placement ticket that wanted to name one had nothing to name.
#
# What both DO have is a committed SEATING: a tool that has already hung that sheet's
# own ladder on the committed grid and written the answer down —
# `tools/seat_michigan_st_tract.py` into `data/traces/michigan_st_tract_seated.json`
# (T-1079), `tools/seat_wabansia_streets.py` into `data/traces/wabansia_seating.json`
# (T-1070, T-1086). The cells below are cut on THAT seating and never on a second one.
# Wabansia's corners come out of `seat_wabansia_streets.seating()` itself, the same
# closure that placed its six streets; the Michigan tract's out of the four corners its
# seating committed. One edge cannot be derived twice, which is the rule that file's own
# `_polygon` states about the one edge it shares with the tract outline, one layer up.
#
# AND THE LOTS ARE THE SHEET'S OWN. This is the half of the parent ticket Kinzie's
# Addition could not answer — there, no lot rule has been read, so its blocks stand
# undivided and say so. Here Wright rules lot lines inside both tracts and both readings
# measured them: thirty-two lot frontages in the Michigan Street tract, west column and
# east, front row and back (`michigan_st_tract_grid.json` § readings.north_south), and
# one column divider per Wabansia block in the tiers where the sheet draws one
# (`wabansia_block_numbering.json` § columns, `lots_wide` and `lot_divider_px`).
#
# NOTHING IS STRETCHED TO FILL. A face the reading did not reach keeps
# `subdivision_withheld` with the reason, the same way the Addition's blocks do — three
# of the Michigan tract's eight faces are in that position. And Wabansia's blocks are
# divided ACROSS ONLY: the sheet draws a north-south lot line and no east-west one, so
# each lot runs the full depth of its tier and the block says that is what the reading
# gives rather than cutting a back row nobody drew.

# The anisotropic stretch the 1834 sheets carry, which this file's header names as the
# reason a block face is generated and never traced. It is the bar a read lot row has to
# close inside before its scale is a fit rather than a disagreement.
