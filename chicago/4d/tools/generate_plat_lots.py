"""Generate the platted block and lot grid from the module, not from a trace.

ROADMAP K7. The 1830 Thompson plat is a PARAMETER source in this dataset — no open
high-resolution scan of it exists and the surviving artifact is a Canal Commissioners'
working copy — so its geometry is generated analytically from the module it fixes
(80-ft streets, 18-ft alleys) and snapped to the street lines this project has already
committed. Tracing the 1834 sheets instead would bake their 3.7-4.5% anisotropic paper
stretch into every block face: the corridors those draughtsmen drew run about 5 ft wide
of 80 on both sheets, which is stretch and pen placement rather than a wider street.

What each part of the output is entitled to claim, and why:

* A **block boundary** is a street centreline offset by half the platted corridor. The
  centrelines are `data/streets/1835.json`, whose own geometry confidence is `inferred`,
  and the half-width is the module. Arithmetic on inferred inputs is inferred, so that is
  what the block edges carry.
* A **lot line** is `conjectural` and stays that way. Four lots to a block face is read
  off the owner's crop of Wright's sheet at the Clark reach — block 18's north row runs
  4 3 2 and its south row 5 6 7 (`docs/RESEARCH/clark_reach_bulge_1834.md` § 8) — and a
  reading of ONE block does not document the subdivision of the other seventeen. The
  alley is worse off: 18 ft is the module, but nothing in `data/sources/` says which
  blocks were alleyed or where the alley ran inside them.
* A block is emitted only where the committed centrelines of all four of its bounding
  streets actually REACH it. Extending a street line past where this project has drawn it
  would be an invention dressed as geometry, so those blocks are listed in `omitted` with
  the street that falls short — which is the same list as the street control still owed
  under ROADMAP § S9.

Thompson's block NUMBERS reach six blocks of this grid and no more. The owner's crop
carries two numerals side by side in the South Water tier — 19 west of 18, the stream in
the La Salle corridor between them — and that fixes the step (one per block) and the
direction (falling eastward) along a row. Counting along that row numbers the tier's six
blocks, and block 16 lands on Dearborn-State, where G. Spring's 'LOT No. 7, in block No.
16 ... on Lake street' and the Mansion House's own Andreas-and-Botsford placement already
agree it should. Nothing outside the tier is numbered: how the run passes from one row to
the next is not readable from two numerals in one row. The judgement, the identification
and the refusals live in `data/traces/thompson_block_numbering.json`; this module only
stamps them. Block ids stay named for the streets that bound them, which is a description
that never goes wrong.

#
# T-1191. A CORRIDOR IS NOT A BLOCK, and until 2026-09-19 this file could not say so:
# one pair of lists decided both which streets a block may be cut between AND which
# streets a building may be reported standing in, so the north bank had neither. That
# is why `plat_corridors.corridors()` returned nothing north of the river and why the
# comment above used to give the block rule as the reason for the corridor gap.
#
# The two questions have different evidence bars. Cutting a block needs BOTH bounding
# lines fixed and the ground between them read. Asking whether a point is in a platted
# roadway needs only that one street's own corridor be read off a sheet — which the
# north bank's are, and have been since T-0451 and T-1060:
#
#   * the Thompson North Division tier — the plat letters the figure 80 at the head of
#     every one of its six corridors, on the Kinzie line, and nothing else
#     (`data/traces/thompson_north_division_streets.json` § lettering); the same sheet's
#     own fit returns an 80 ft corridor as 45.6 px = 24.4 m against the platted 24.384
#     (`docs/RESEARCH/north_division_streets.md` § 3);
#   * Kinzie's Addition — 22.17 m, read corridor by corridor off Wright's 1834 survey
#     and scaled against the Original Town's corridors on the same sheet
#     (`data/traces/kinzie_addition_street_grid.json` § control_summary).
#
# Each record carries its own `corridor_width_m` and this module uses it, because the
# Addition's corridor is 2.2 m narrower than the Original Town's and one town-wide
# half-width would have drawn the Addition's roadways over its own lot lines.
#
# NORTH WATER STREET IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. It is the one north-bank street whose
# line is derived from the river bank rather than from a platted rule
# (`tools/derive_north_water.py`), it bends through 26 vertices, and T-0447 records
# that the plat does not give it the ground it runs on. Offsetting that polyline by
# half a module would invent a rectangle the sheet does not draw. The north-bank
# frontage rule stays `tools/measure_north_bank_frontage.py`, unchanged.
