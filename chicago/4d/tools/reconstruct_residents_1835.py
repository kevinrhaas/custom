"""T-1167: the ONE writer of a `reconstructed` resident, and its programme's gate.

`grade: reconstructed` means a person the sources do not name, drawn from the
population model to fill a count the town demonstrably needs. The owner retired the
previous reconstructed population on 2026-09-02 because nothing said, in one place,
what had been invented or what would replace it, and ruled that it comes back only
under an explicit programme file. That file is
`data/reconstruction/1835_resident_reconstruction_programme.json`; this tool is the
only thing allowed to act on it.

THE BOUNDARY, IN ONE LINE. Every research writer of `data/residents/` calls
`tools/refuse_reconstructed_grade.refuse()` and may emit only `attested` or
`inferred`. This tool does not call it. That asymmetry IS the rule, it is asserted
from both sides — `refuse_reconstructed_grade.py --check` proves the four writers
still carry their call, and `--self-test` below proves this one is held to the
record contract instead — and neither half is a comment.

A STAGE IS A TICKET. Bands 3A-3C each own one stage of one deterministic build, so
the whole reconstructed layer re-derives from the programme rather than accreting.
`--stage <key> --build` runs one; `--check` re-derives every IMPLEMENTED stage and
holds the committed layer to the record contract; `--self-test` runs the mutation
cases. No stage is implemented by T-1167 itself: this ticket writes no person, and
`--build` says so rather than inventing a default.

# stage `attribute_fill_arrival` (T-1169) — arrival year, origin and reason
#
# The first stage of this programme that writes anything, and it writes no PERSON:
# it fills three attribute blocks on households that already exist, at the strongest
# tier each household's own evidence allows. Three legs, in order:
#
#   1. THE EVIDENCE LEG. The Old Settlers roll gives an arrival year and a birthplace
#      for the 46 of its 327 rows the crosswalk merged into this layer. Those are
#      spent onto exactly the cards they name, at `inferred` — never `attested`,
#      because the roll is a recollection registered in 1879 and its own
#      `arrival_year_basis` says it dates the claim and does not prove it.
#   2. THE DRAWN LEG. An arrival YEAR for the 1,196 households whose `arrival` holds
#      a `not_later_than` BOUND and no reading, drawn from the known layer's own
#      year distribution truncated at that bound; and an origin region drawn from the
#      roll's birthplace distribution. `basis.kind` is `model` and each carries the
#      seed that redraws it.
#   3. THE ARGUED LEG. A reason for coming, from the household's own recorded trade
#      where it has one and from its arrival season where it does not. `basis.kind`
#      is `rule` and there is no seed, because nothing was drawn — see the programme
#      file's `arrival_fill.the_argued_leg.WHY_IS_NOT_APPORTIONED` for why this stage
#      refuses to build the cohort x trade table T-1169 asked for.
#
# EVERY BLOCK THIS STAGE WRITES CARRIES `written_by_stage`. That marker is the whole
# of how `--check` re-derives: a block the stage owns is recomputed and compared, and
# a block it does not own is one some earlier reading put there and is not touched.
# Without it `--build` would be a one-way write — the second run would see a filled
# `origin` and skip it, and nothing could ever say the committed value still follows
# from the model row it claims.

#
# The 1840 federal census counts a household by sex and age band and names only its
# head. Where THIS layer has already bridged that head to an 1835 resident - a
# separate adjudication, made in `census_1840_identity_bridges.csv` on 1835 evidence
# and never on the household composition - the row's other tallies are a count of
# people who were alive, in that head's house, five years later. Back-projected, the
# ones born before the scene date were alive on 1 July 1835 too, and the card names
# almost none of them.
#
# THREE THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
#   * It does not use an unbridged 1840 row. T-0507's line stands for everyone else:
#     1840 Chicago had roughly doubled, so its households are a SHAPE to test against
#     and not a population to fill from.
#   * It does not carry the under-5 band. Under 5 on 1840-06-01 means born on or after
#     1835-06-02, and all but the first month of that span is after the scene date.
#     Nothing in the band says which, so the whole band is dropped rather than a
#     fraction of it guessed.
#   * It does not claim a relation the count does not state. A row that says "one free
#     white female 30 under 40" says a woman lived there; it does not say wife, mother,
#     sister or servant. These people are `household_member`, or `child` where the
#     back-projected band is under fifteen, and nothing more.
