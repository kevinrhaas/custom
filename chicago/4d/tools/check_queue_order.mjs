/**
 * The owner's queue ranking may not go BACKWARDS. Asserted on the branch.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is T-0817's first ask, written after the ranking was
 * lost for the second time.
 *
 *   2026-09-04  the owner: the queue "got massively reordered ... please put it
 *               back with all of the research items ... at the top". Restored.
 *   2026-09-05  gone again. `origin/dev` at d08fae3b4 carried the restored file
 *               at 415 lines; one merge later — PR #801, a branch cut long
 *               before the re-rank — dev carried 321 lines opening with the
 *               2026-08-30 revision. The whole research band was gone, and the
 *               ledger explaining it with it.
 *   2026-09-05  and a third time, to the drain band (#909): "it has now been
 *               stripped THREE times ... which is how six tickets the owner put
 *               at the top of QUEUE.md came to be sitting at line 416."
 *
 * WHY A GATE AND NOT ONLY A BETTER MERGE DRIVER. `tools/merge-queue.mjs` did its
 * job in the #801 case — it refused — and it was not enough, for a reason T-0817
 * states exactly: **GitHub does not run this repository's merge drivers.** A
 * squash-merge on the server never loads .gitattributes' driver, so the driver
 * protects a local `git merge` and cannot protect the thing that actually lands.
 * A gate can, because `check.sh` IS the required `gate` check on dev's ruleset —
 * so this refuses the merge button itself, which no driver can reach.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, and it is deliberately not a judgement about ranking. The
 * RE-RANK LEDGER at the top of QUEUE.md records one entry per re-rank, each
 * quoting the instruction behind it. A branch cut before a re-rank is missing
 * that entry. So:
 *
 *     every ledger entry on the BASE must still be present on the BRANCH.
 *
 * That is decidable without reading a single ranking, which is the whole point:
 * the gate never asks whether an order is good, only whether the branch has
 * silently dropped a decision the base had already recorded. T-0817's own words:
 * "A PR that carries an older ledger than its base is carrying a regression, and
 * that is decidable without judging any ranking."
 *
 * ENTRIES ARE COMPARED AS A SET, NOT BY DATE. Two re-ranks happened on
 * 2026-09-05 alone, so "is our newest date >= theirs" would have passed a branch
 * that dropped one of them. The identity of an entry is its first line, which
 * carries the date and the instruction.
 *
 * IT SKIPS RATHER THAN GUESSES when there is no base to compare against — a
 * clone with no `origin/dev`, a detached checkout, an offline runner. A gate that
 * fails for want of a network is a gate people learn to bypass.
