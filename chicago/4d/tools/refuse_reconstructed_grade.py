"""T-1144 acceptance 8: a research writer may not mint a `reconstructed` resident.

`grade` is the resident-EVIDENCE classification on a person: `attested` for a
confidently corroborated real named circa-1835 Chicagoan, `inferred` for one
reasonably believed to belong to that population. A third value exists in the
vocabulary — `reconstructed` — and it is reserved. It means a person the sources
do not name, drawn from the population model to fill a count the town needs. The
owner retired the previous reconstructed population on 2026-09-02 and ruled that
it comes back only under an explicit programme file; T-1167 is where that begins.

The danger this refuses is not a writer that sets the field on purpose. It is the
quiet one: a mint that falls through to a default, or a later pass that copies a
grade off a reconstructed neighbour, and the town gains people no source names
without anyone deciding that it should. `mint_documented_residents.py`,
`mint_letter_list_residents.py` and `mint_placed_residents.py` each hardcode
`"grade": "attested"` today and `synthesize_resident_research.py` retires any
reconstructed person it meets — so this is an invariant that happens to hold, and
nothing asserted it. T-1228's lesson on this same gate file is that an invariant
nobody asserts is one a refactor may delete unseen.

So: every writer of the resident layer calls `refuse()` on what it is about to
write, in EVERY mode including `--check`, and `--check` here proves every one of
them is still wired. The reconstruction generator T-1167 brings simply does not call it;
that is the whole boundary, and it is one line per writer to see.

What this does NOT touch: per-attribute `confidence`. A record may say
`{"value": null, "confidence": "reconstructed", "note": "Not attested."}` about
one field of a real attested person, and hundreds do. That is a statement about
one fact, not about whether the person existed, and refusing it would be wrong.
