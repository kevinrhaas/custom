"""T-0714 — every tool that can re-derive itself, and whether the gate ever asks it to.

    tools/audit_check_gates.py            the report: which --check modes check.sh runs
    tools/audit_check_gates.py --gate     fail if the ungated set has GROWN
    tools/audit_check_gates.py --write    re-record the baseline after a deliberate change
    tools/audit_check_gates.py --self-test

WHY THIS EXISTS. `crosswalk_census_1840_heads.py --check` had been red on `dev` for an
unknown number of days when T-0714 measured it: 498 heads adjudicated on disk against
788 read off the pages. Every sibling crosswalk IS gated and fails the moment its
committed file stops re-deriving; this one alone was not, so 290 heads of reading sat
un-adjudicated without one red build. The fault is not the crosswalk. The fault is that
NOTHING ASKED whether a tool with a `--check` mode is wired into `tools/check.sh`, so the
answer could only ever be found by hand, one tool at a time, by someone who suspected it.

WHAT THIS ASSERTS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It does not assert that every `--check` runs in
the gate: some of these are one-shot passes whose inputs are gone, some are slow, and a
few are red today for reasons that are their own tickets (T-0691 holds
`mint_letter_list_residents.py --check`, which is red because a cohort drifted, not
because this file is wrong). Gating them is work with rulings in it and it is not free.
What this asserts is a RATCHET: the set of `--check`-capable tools the gate never runs
may SHRINK freely and may not GROW. A new derivation arrives gated, or it arrives with a
deliberate line in `data/research/check_gate_baseline.json` saying why not.

HOW IT READS check.sh. A tool counts as gated when `tools/check.sh` invokes it with
`--check` anywhere — the same string a reader would grep for. A tool check.sh runs under
some OTHER mode (`--gate`, `--self-test`, `--offline`) is still counted UNGATED here, and
the report says which modes it does run, because those modes prove different things: a
self-test proves the assertions fire, and only `--check` proves the committed file still
follows from its inputs.

WHAT T-0896 ADDED, AND WHY THE RATCHET ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH. T-0714's baseline recorded
the tools and nothing else, and `--write` rebuilt the file from the survey — so a reason
written into it by hand did not survive the next write, and the acceptance T-0896 was
filed with ("each carries a stated reason a reader can act on") could not be met at all.
Reasons are AUTHORED now, `--write` carries them forward by tool, and the gate asks for
one. Three ways to fail instead of one:

  * a tool newly ungated and absent from the baseline — the original ratchet;
  * a tool in the baseline that the gate DOES run `--check` on now. The set may shrink
    freely, but the file has to be told, in the commit that shrank it. It was not: the
    baseline said 18 on 2026-09-13 and the survey said 16, because
    `crosswalk_norris_1844_advertiser.py` and `generate_school_section_grid.py` had been
    gated since and nothing asked. A ratchet that can only measure growth against a
    number allowed to stay too high is a ratchet with slack in it;
  * an ungated tool carrying no `why_not_gated`. Silence is what this whole file exists
    to end, and an empty string is silence.

A REASON IS NOT ONLY "it cannot be gated". Ten of the sixteen are ungated because their
`--check` is RED — the committed file has stopped following from its inputs and nobody
knew. That is a finding, not an exemption, so those rows carry the measured red and the
ticket that owns it; `owner_ticket` is where a reader goes next.
