"""Carry Kinzie Street west, from the town's last committed point to Wabansia's own
boundary rule.

    tools/carry_kinzie_west.py            print what it would write
    tools/carry_kinzie_west.py --write    write data/streets/1835.json and the trace
    tools/carry_kinzie_west.py --check    the committed reach re-derives from the readings

T-1085, found by T-1070. `kinzie` in `data/streets/1835.json` ends at local east -320,
attested off the Thompson plat (T-0713), which draws the Original Town and stops at its
west boundary. J. S. Wright's 1834 survey draws the same street on west, the whole length
of Wabansia: the corridor is read and committed at `data/traces/wabansia_streets.json`
§ streets `kinzie`, with Wright's own `Kinzie` lettering inside it at NA px 1150-1450,
y 2060-2110. So the reach exists on a sheet this project holds, and the committed line
was silent about it — while T-1070's seating had to EXTRAPOLATE that line 418 m west to
have something to hang Wabansia's ladder from, and said so in writing. Six streets stood
committed north of a line that did not reach them.

WHY IT IS ITS OWN RECORD AND NOT A LONGER `kinzie`. `data/streets/1835.json` § _doc:
"a bend added to the plat line moves platted lot lines the whole length of the street and
re-scores the corridor-intrusion count". This carries no bend — the reach is collinear
with the committed line by construction, and `--check` asserts it — so nothing moves. But
the two halves are NOT THE SAME CLAIM and a record carries one confidence, one surface and
one traffic:

  * EAST of -320 the Thompson plat draws the street and the town wears it: geometry
    `attested`, `worn_earth`, traffic `ordinary`.
  * WEST of it Wright draws the street and nothing in this corpus wears it: geometry
    `inferred`, `unworn_prairie`, traffic `none`.

The project already splits a street this way where the claim changes — `market` and
`market_north`, `michigan_north` and `michigan_north_tract` — and this follows them.

WHAT IS ATTESTED AND WHAT IS INFERRED, kept apart because the temptation is to trade one
for the other. Wright ATTESTS THAT the street runs here: he rules the corridor across the
whole tract and letters it. What this tool INFERS is WHERE it lies. Carried through the NA
sheet's own affine, Wright's Kinzie corridor centre lands 9.1 m south of the committed line
at the tract's west end — the same figure T-1070 measured — because the sheet's drawn
bearing in this corner is about 1.2 deg off the one the committed grid takes from modern
control over a baseline four times longer, against a registration admitting 16.19 m RMS
with no control point within 900 m of this tract. So the same division of labour the
seating used holds here: the SHEET says the street is there and how far west it goes, the
COMMITTED GRID says where the line runs and which way it lies. `geometry_confidence` is
`inferred` for that reason and not because the reach is in doubt.

THE WEST END is Wabansia's own west boundary rule at tier 7 — the tier Kinzie Street
bounds on the south — read by T-1074 at `data/traces/wabansia_block_numbering.json`
§ west_margin, and it is the outer rule of that pair, which is the same bound
`seat_wabansia_streets.py` gives the six streets north of here. The reading stops where
the tract stops and this line stops with it: Wright carries Kinzie further west still,
off the tract and off T-1074's reading, and that ground is nobody's yet.

THE EAST END is `kinzie`'s own west end, to the centimetre, so the two records meet
without a gap and without an overlap.

    "KINZIE STREET WEST OF THE TOWN, the 430 m between the Original Town's west boundary "
    "and Wabansia's — a separate record from `kinzie` because the two halves are not the "
    "same claim (T-1085). WHAT EACH SHEET GIVES: the Thompson plat draws Kinzie Street to "
    "the town's west line and stops, which is why `kinzie` stops at local east -320 and is "
    "`attested` there (T-0713, the owner's ruling of 2026-09-04). J. S. Wright's 1834 "
    "survey rules this corridor across the whole of Wabansia and letters `Kinzie` inside "
    "it (NA px 1150-1450, y 2060-2110), read at data/traces/wabansia_streets.json. So THAT "
    "the street runs here is Wright's claim and this project takes it. WHERE it runs is "
    "derived: the line is the committed `kinzie` line carried west on its own bearing to "
    "the easting of Wabansia's west boundary rule, which T-1074 read at tier 7. Wright's "
    "own corridor centre, carried through the NA sheet's affine, lands 9.1 m south of that "
    "line at the tract's west end — a bearing about 1.2 deg off, against a registration "
    "admitting 16.19 m RMS with no control point within 900 m of this tract — so the sheet "
    "measures the extent and the committed grid holds the line. `geometry_confidence` is "
    "`inferred` for that derivation, not because the reach is doubtful. STATUS, argued "
    "rather than inherited from `kinzie`: east of -320 the street is a worn earth track "
    "with ordinary traffic, which is a claim about the town's own ground, where the "
    "buildings and the bridge approach are. West of it this corridor runs along the south "
    "line of a survey over prairie — Wabansia's six streets north of it are committed "
    "`platted, unopened, unworn` on the same reading, and the one household the sources "
    "put on that tract before this date is a single advertised dwelling. Nothing in this "
    "corpus attests a wagon track, a grade or ordinary traffic 430 m west of the town's "
    "last building, so none is drawn: `track_width_m` is 0 and the wear claim stops at the "
    "seam, which is exactly where the evidence stops. COLLINEAR WITH `kinzie` BY "
    "CONSTRUCTION and gated so: this record adds no bend to the plat line, so no platted "
    "lot line moves and the corridor-intrusion count is re-scored rather than assumed "
    "(T-1085 records both numbers). Generated by tools/carry_kinzie_west.py — do not "
    "hand-edit the path."
