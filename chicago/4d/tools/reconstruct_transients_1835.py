"""T-1353, stage `transients` — the summer crowd of 1835, counted apart from the town.

    python3 tools/reconstruct_transients_1835.py --self-test  the rules, each refusing its own case

WHAT THIS STAGE IS. The Chicago American of 13 June 1835 puts the town's own population
at 2,500 to 3,000 and then says, in the next breath, that "strangers, to the amount of
some hundreds more, fill our public houses and streets". MORE — outside its own estimate.
T-1352 bounded those strangers at 192 to 900 persons on 1 July 1835 and deliberately
adopted no point, printing two candidates and leaving the choice here. This stage spends
one of them, mints the crowd as reconstructed persons, and keeps it OUT of the resident
count, because a visitor of the season is not a resident and the whole distinction is
what the model is built on.

THE POINT THIS STAGE ADOPTS: **384**, the reading `twice the 1843 rate`.

Why that one and not 550. The 384 stands on the only figure Chicago's own enumerator ever
printed for transients — 533 of them, in a row of his own, in the census of 1 August 1843 —
doubled because 1 July 1835 was a land-sale week and 1 August 1843 was not. The multiplier
is invented and the model says so; the RATE under it is measured. The 550 is the midpoint
of a newspaper's "some hundreds more", which is an editor's impression printed eighteen
days before the scene and BEFORE the sale crowd arrived, and which the same paper offers
as a phrase rather than as a count. This project prefers a measured comparandum with an
invented multiplier over a rhetorical band read at its middle, because the first names the
one invented step and the second is invented end to end. Both sit inside T-1352's bracket;
384 is the lower and this stage takes the lower, as the bracket's own floor row does.

AND THE CAPACITY ARGUMENT THAT LOOKS LIKE EVIDENCE AND IS NOT. The lodging model's BUILT
places carry 320 surge beds — the gap between their ordinary night and their crowded one —
and the minted cohort below is 307, which is a near-perfect fit and would read as a
confirmation. It is not one. The town of 1835 had 42 boarding houses and this
reconstruction has built five of them; the programme's full surge is 764, not 320, and the
fit is a measurement of how far the STRUCTURE band has got rather than of anything the
crowd did. Reading it the other way would let the reconstruction's own incompleteness
choose a population, so it is written down here and refused.

WHAT IT MINTS, AND THE FOUR THINGS IT REFUSES TO MINT. Of the 384, seventy-seven are set
aside and 307 are drawn. Each refusal has a reason a reader can check:

  1. THE NAMED LAND-SALE PURCHASERS. The Public Domain register enters 232 purchases at
     Chicago on 26-27 June 1835 from 105 distinct purchasers, of whom the resident
     crosswalk can place only 28 in the town — a floor of 77 visitors the register NAMES.
     A drawn person may never stand in for a person a source names, so those 77 slots are
     reserved and left empty. They are owed a reading, not a draw.
  2. THE CREWS ASHORE. T-1352 records 4 to 6 hulls lying at Chicago on the scene date from
     the Marine Journal of 4 July 1835, and no committed source in this corpus gives a
     crew complement for an 1830s lake schooner. Without one, a crew is a number this
     project would be inventing whole, so the hulls carry nobody and T-1372 — which seats
     the crews — is told what it is waiting for.
  3. THE HARBOUR-WORKS GANG. The federal harbour improvement was at work through 1835 and
     no committed source gives its strength in any month. Same refusal, same reason.
  4. THE TRAVELLERS OF BUSINESS AND OF STATE. The papers name these one at a time — the
     Democrat of 1 July has Lewis Cass, Secretary of War, arrived on the 29th in the
     steamer Michigan. A man a newspaper names is a reading waiting to be made, and
     drawing an invented traveller beside him would bury him.

  So the 307 are ONE row of T-1352's composition table: the immigrant and land-seeking
  parties awaiting lots — the row the sources describe as a crowd rather than as people
  they could name. "Our wharves are covered with men, women and children just landed from
  the vessels."

WHERE THEY SLEPT — and the one liberty this stage takes. T-1352 names six classes of
sleeping place, each a sentence in a committed source, and RANKS NONE OF THEM. No source
in this corpus gives a share. An equal deal across the six is therefore the only
apportionment that adds no ranking the record does not carry; it is stated as a liberty,
it is seeded, and every share is replaceable by a source that ranks them. 307 over six is
51 apiece with one over, and the remainder goes to the first class in the table's own
printed order.

  * The four ROOFED classes — a room in a public house, the floor of that room, the floor
    of a private house, a store house thrown open — become `party` households, and their
    `lodged_at` row resolves to the CLASS and not to a house. This stage names no inn and
    fills no bed: the lodging places' beds are dealt by T-1371 and T-1372 out of the
    lodging model's surge, and a transient seated into a tavern here would be booked into
    a bed that stage is about to sell twice.
  * The two OUT-OF-DOORS classes — the open sky upon the wharves, a tent at the landing
    place — become `camp` households whose `lodged_at` row names `the_landing_place`, the
    one camp ground a committed source actually puts people on ("Some build tents upon the
    spot they were landed from the boats"). It is a CANDIDATE, not a placement: T-1214
    owns where a camp stands and how large it is, and the row says so.

WHY `lodged_at[]` AND NOT `lives_at`. `lives_at` is the residence a household kept in this
town, and the town census counts a person as housed when it names a structure the scene
carries. A visitor of the season kept no residence, and writing one would move the resident
count — which is the one thing this ticket forbids. So the singular field stays null with
its reason on it, and where somebody slept for a fortnight travels in a plural list that
carries its own rung, its own tier and the ticket that resolves it.

NOTHING HERE IS A FINDING. Every person is graded `reconstructed`, carries the model row
and the seed that redraws them, and says in their own note what evidence retires them.
No Native or Metis person is written: T-1352 carries the Native-visitor row as a bracket
and not as people, stage `underdocumented` (T-1177) is the only stage that may mint one,
and this stage draws from the two eastern pools only — the crowd coming off the lake
vessels in June 1835 is the emigrant trade out of New England, New York and Ireland, and
the French colonial community of this country is the oldest RESIDENT community here
rather than a summer arrival.
