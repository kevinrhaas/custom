"""Norris's 1844 firms, dated against 1835 (T-0588).

    tools/date_norris_1844_businesses.py [--check]

THE QUESTION THIS FILE ANSWERS, and it is a dating question, not a matching one:
of the firms Norris's 1844 volume prints, which ones does some printing put in the
town of 1 July 1835? Under the ratified ladder an 1844 listing alone never puts a
business in the 1835 town, so a firm reaches this scene only if a DATE reaches it,
and the ticket names the three printings that could carry one — the Historical
Sketch, the firm's own advertising card, and Fergus's 1843 directory. This walks
all three over every firm the volume prints and writes down what each one reached.

THE THREE DATING ROUTES, written out so they read back without the code:
  SKETCH. The 65 town findings read out of Norris's own Historical Sketch and
  Statistical Account (T-0567) carry a `describes_date`. A finding dated at or
  before 1835 whose PRINTED QUOTE names every significant word of a firm's name is
  a candidate dating; the reader's `normalized` gloss is deliberately NOT searched,
  because it is this project's prose and finding this project's own words in it
  would date nothing.
  OWN CARD. A card in the Advertising Directory (T-0568) may print its own
  founding — "established 18xx", "since 18xx", "commenced business in 18xx". The
  card's `dated_statement`, and a scan of the card's printed text for founding
  language beside a year, are both taken.
  FERGUS 1843. Fergus's 1843 directory (T-0571) is a year nearer the scene and its
  business entries are advertisements too. A Fergus entry matched to the firm and
  carrying founding language beside a year at or before 1835 is a dating; a Fergus
  entry with no such year is PRESENCE IN 1843 and is not one. Being in print in
  1843 is not being in business in 1835, and this file never treats it as though
  it were.

CONTINUITY IS THE FOURTH THING, AND IT IS WORTH LESS THAN A DATE. A firm the 1835
newspapers already carry — the 206 businesses of `gazetteer.json` — and Norris
still prints in 1844 is corroborated as having survived nine years. That is
CONTINUITY: it confirms a business the town already holds and it adds none, it
carries no founding date, and it moves no grade. It is recorded here because the
owner's ask was to validate and confirm as well as to add, and because a reader
who finds Newberry & Dole in both volumes should be able to see that this project
noticed. The rule is the standing one, adapted from names to firm styles:
  A firm printing and an 1835 business agree when the SET of surnames printed in
  the firm style is equal on both sides, and no given-name initial printed on both
  sides for a shared surname contradicts. A ONE-surname firm additionally REQUIRES
  an initial printed on both sides and agreeing — "B. Jones & Co." against a town
  that holds a Jones is the eleven-Smiths refusal, however good it looks. Where a
  firm meets more than one 1835 business on that rule the match is AMBIGUOUS and
  is filed as such, not resolved.

WHAT THIS WRITES INTO THE TOWN: nothing. That is the finding, not an omission —
see the `written` block, which carries the reason in the file rather than only in
a pull request nobody will read again.
