"""Trace the 1834 Chicago River channel at the forks off the Wright 1834 survey.

The river geometry in `data/terrain/epochs/e1834_harbor_cut/` is not a shape
someone drew by eye — it is the output of this computation, whose inputs are the
committed ground control (`data/traces/gcp/wright_1834_gcps.json`), the committed
datum (`data/datum.json`), and one IIIF region of the BPL master scan whose
sha256 is recorded in the output. Re-running it reproduces the GeoJSON.

    python3 tools/trace_river.py            re-trace and write the GeoJSON
    python3 tools/trace_river.py --check    re-trace and diff against what is committed
    python3 tools/trace_river.py --debug    also write a PNG overlay of the trace
    python3 tools/trace_river.py --check-properties
                                            hold the committed files to the literals this
                                            file writes: no numpy, no network, milliseconds.
                                            This one IS in tools/check.sh; see the function.

How it works, and why it is a trace rather than an inference
------------------------------------------------------------
Wright draws the river the way period plats do: a **black bank line with a grey
wash band on the water side of it**, the middle of the channel left as bare
paper. So the water is not one colour to threshold — it is the region *between*
two shaded bands. The steps:

  1. local background: the paper's luminance varies with foxing, stain and the
     scan's vignette, so "darker than paper" is measured against a block
     percentile of the neighbourhood rather than a global level;
  2. the grey wash is separated from the pink/green/blue/yellow ward washes by
     its lack of hue departure from the local paper, not by luminance;
  3. a morphological CLOSING across the unshaded mid-channel joins the two bands
     into one solid channel, and an opening sheds the thin coloured street bands
     that touch it;
  4. seeds on each reach select the channel blob, holes are filled, the boundary
     is traced and simplified;
  5. pixels go to EPSG:26916 through the same least-squares affine that fixed the
     datum, then to local ENU metres.

Needs numpy, scipy, Pillow. The full re-trace is not part of tools/check.sh —
like the datum re-derivation it is a deliberate, occasional re-run, and it
degrades to a clear skip when the dependencies or the network are missing. That
left a "do not hand-edit" file with nothing gating it at all: `hydrology.geojson`
drifted from this generator on two provenance grades and no gate could see it
for a month (T-0687). `--check-properties` closes the half that costs nothing —
every literal these files carry, checked offline — and `tools/check.sh` runs it.

    The speckle floor exists so that stray tinted paper is not dragged into the

    away drafted bank wash. Rows 662-690 of the region carry a dry seam three to
    six pixels wide *inside* the wash, running parallel to the bank a little west
    of it; the strip of wash east of that seam is 205 px, well under the 500 px
    floor, and goes out with the specks. The closing is then left with nothing to
    bridge to, so the traced boundary walks the seam instead of the bank and

    """Hold the committed GeoJSON to the literals above — offline, in milliseconds.

    `--check` is the real gate: it re-traces the scan and reproduces both files
    byte for byte. It cannot live in `tools/check.sh`, and the cost of putting it
    there is the reason, not an oversight — it needs numpy, scipy and Pillow,
    which the agent sandbox does not carry, and it fetches a 1,120 px IIIF region
    from Boston Public Library over the network. A per-commit gate that installs
    a scientific stack and reaches the internet is a gate that gets skipped, and
    a skipped gate is what let T-0687 happen.

    So the half that needs neither is gated instead. Everything this file writes
    divides cleanly in two: MEASURED values, which come out of the image or the
    GCP refit, and LITERALS, which are typed here. The drift T-0687 found was
    entirely in the literals — two provenance grades — and so is every drift a
    hand-edit of a "do not hand-edit" file can plausibly introduce, because
    hand-editing coordinates is not a thing anybody does by accident. This
    compares every literal and takes the measured numbers as given.

    What it therefore does NOT catch, said plainly so nobody trusts it too far:
    a coordinate, a `drafted_width_m`, an affine RMS or the region sha256 that
    stops matching the scan. Only `--check` can see those, and it stays a
    deliberate, occasional re-run.
