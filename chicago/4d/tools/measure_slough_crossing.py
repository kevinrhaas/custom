"""Does the Slough Log Bridge span open water, or does it span solid ground?

T-0109. The question is the ticket's title and it was a real fault for two
months: the crossing stood at its attested place on Water Street with the South
Division's drain unmodelled beneath it, so a visitor walked a timber deck laid
over prairie. `data/structures/slough_log_bridge.json` said so in its own words,
`docs/LIBERTIES.md` L69 said so, and nothing measured it.

    tools/measure_slough_crossing.py          print the readings
    tools/measure_slough_crossing.py --gate   exit 1 if the crossing spans dry ground

THE CUT LANDED WITHOUT THIS GATE AND THAT IS THE POINT. T-0005 carved zone 14
into the terrain epoch (changelog v204) and T-0118 straightened its last reach
under this very deck (v210) — both AFTER T-0109 was filed, neither aimed at it,
and no check anywhere would have noticed if the channel had come back a metre
west and left the deck over dry bank again. A terrain spec is a stack of swale
entries with hand-written lines and half-widths, and a bridge is a placement in
a different file; nothing but this reading joins them.

WHAT IS ASSERTED, and each one is a way the crossing can be wrong:

 1. OPEN WATER UNDER THE DECK. Along the deck's own span, the committed
    heightfield must fall below the epoch's water surface in one continuous run.
    A run of less than `MIN_OPEN_WATER_M` is a damp swale, not a stream a town
    would bridge, and this is the assertion that fails if the channel moves out
    from under the deck.
 2. THE ABUTMENTS STAND ON BANK. That run must not reach either end of the span:
    a log crossing lands on dry ground at both ends, and a deck whose ends are in
    the water is a raft. `MIN_BANK_SEAT_M` is the seat each end must keep.
 3. THE DRAIN REACHES THE RIVER. From the deck to the watercourse's mouth, every
    sample along the spec's own centreline must be below the water surface —
    otherwise the crossing spans a puddle rather than a watercourse, which is the
    same fault wearing a different face. Upstream is NOT asserted: the record
    reads the July drain above its backed-up pool as a damp swale standing above
    the water, so a dry reading there is the claim and not a failure.
 4. THE RECORD'S CLEARANCE IS THE SCENE'S. `clearance_m` is the one flatly
    conjectural dimension on the crossing, and the deck it describes is built
    from `walk_surface_m` less the stringer and the plank. Those three numbers
    live in three places and nothing held them together.
 5. NOTHING ELSE STANDS IN THE CUT. Inside the crossing's reach, anything rooted
    on ground below the water surface must either BE the crossing or declare that
    it rides it (`rides`), the way the river walk's crossing footway does.

The deck is not described here. Its span, its width, its bearing and its
clearance are read out of the committed record, so this file holds one number
about 1835 and it is zero: everything else is the dataset's own.
