"""Validate the 4D Chicago dataset.

Runs in seconds and needs no Blender. This is the per-commit gate.

    validate.py --stale      also recompute every committed GLB's input hash

    validate.py --all        everything
    validate.py --strict     warnings become errors

The rules enforced here are the project's contract, not style preferences:
documented requires a resolving source, inferred requires stated reasoning, a
structure must have exactly one phase covering a scene's date, and geometry
cannot be generated while the datum origin is unverified.

# 25 -> 28 ON 2026-08-29 (T-0317), AND IT IS A CONSCIOUS RE-BUDGET RATHER THAN A
# WEAKENED ASSERTION. Say which one you are doing, so: this is the first one.
#
# WHERE 25 CAME FROM. docs/PLAN.md set it at the start of the project, when the
# payload was 4.5 MB, as "reasonable" — not as a limit anything imposes. It is not
# a GitHub Pages limit: Pages allows 1 GB a site and 100 MB a file. The LFS clause
# above is the real constraint and it is about FORMAT, not size — the tree must hold
# plain binaries — and 28 MB is as plain as 25 MB. docs/RENDERING.md § the gate table
# has recorded a sanctioned raise to ~100 MB at H2 since the rendering plan was
# written, so the direction was never in question, only the occasion.
#
# WHAT SUPPORTS 28, MEASURED. `dev` publishes at 24.901 MB — 99,573 bytes of
# headroom, which is 0.4 % of the budget. A single platted-block deal of four roofs
# adds 138,399 bytes, so the budget was ALREADY exhausted for every visible parcel in
# the queue before this one: T-0317 is simply the run that hit the wall. 28 MB restores
# 2.85 MB of headroom, which is about twenty more block deals at the rate this one
# measured, and it leaves the payload at a quarter of the sanctioned H2 figure.
#
# WHAT WILL EXHAUST IT AGAIN, WRITTEN DOWN RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER. 1,899,254
# bytes of the tree — 7.2 % of it — are TWO byte-identical copies of changelog.js,
# published to `js/` and to `walk/js/` because both paths are contracts (AGENTS.md §
# changelog). That is the fastest-growing item in the payload and it grows on every
# release rather than on every building. Filed as its own ticket; this raise buys the
# time to answer it and does not answer it.
#
# 28 -> 32 ON 2026-08-30 (T-0379), AND IT IS THE SECOND CONSCIOUS RE-BUDGET RATHER
# THAN A WEAKENED ASSERTION. Saying which one, as the note above requires: this is a
# re-budget. Nothing was made cheaper to pass and nothing was moved out of the tree to
# duck the number.
#
# WHAT EXHAUSTED 28, AND IT WAS NOT A BUILDING. The owner was asked how many of the
# names known only from the post office's lists of uncalled-for letters this town
# should hold, was shown that holding all of them makes three quarters of its people a
# name and nothing else — and what a record costs, in as many words, "705 files" — and
# ruled on 2026-08-30 that it should hold all of them. 712 household records joined the
# 15 already standing. That is the largest single addition to the published tree this
# corpus can make, it was decided with the file count in view, and it is not a class of
# growth the last raise's arithmetic (roofs per block deal) was measuring.
#
# WHAT WAS DONE BEFORE RAISING, MEASURED. The 727 records were first cut from 5,503 to
# 3,661 bytes each — 1.34 MB, a third of the cohort — by moving the reasoning IDENTICAL
# on all 727 of them out of 727 files and into the one place it belongs: L214 in
# docs/LIBERTIES.md, the pass's own docstring, and the Evidence panel's group heading,
# which is where a reader meets it anyway. That is a saving worth having whatever the
# budget is, and it was not enough: the tree publishes at 28.48 MiB, 0.48 over. Going
# further would have meant deleting the reasoning rather than de-duplicating it, and a
# record that states its evidence and not what that evidence is worth is the thing this
# project's whole confidence model exists to refuse.
#
# WHAT SUPPORTS 32. The LFS clause above is still the real constraint and it is about
# FORMAT: the tree holds plain binaries at 32 MiB exactly as it did at 25. Pages allows
# 1 GB a site, docs/RENDERING.md § the gate table has recorded a sanctioned raise to
# ~100 MB at H2 since the rendering plan was written, and 32 MiB is under a third of
# that. It restores 3.52 MiB of headroom — more than the 2.85 the last raise bought —
# and the two largest items in the tree are now named and ticketed rather than
# discovered: the letter-list cohort at 2.54 MiB (T-0379, this) and the duplicated
# changelog at 2.07 MiB, 7.3 % of the tree, which is T-0364 and is still unanswered.
#
# 32 -> 36 ON 2026-09-05 (T-0593), AND IT IS THE THIRD CONSCIOUS RE-BUDGET RATHER THAN
# A WEAKENED ASSERTION. Saying which one, as the note above requires: this is a
# re-budget. Nothing was made cheaper to pass, nothing was moved out of the tree to duck
# the number, and no reasoning was deleted to fit under it.
#
# WHAT EXHAUSTED 32, MEASURED ON `dev` AT 06a0a9ec. The published tree stands at
# 33,553,488 bytes against a ceiling of 33,554,432 — 944 BYTES of headroom, which is
# 0.003 % of the budget. That is not a margin; it is a wall that the next merge of any
# kind walks into. A release entry alone costs about 5.4 KB, because the changelog is
# published twice (below, and T-0364), so the budget was already spent for every ticket
# in the queue before this one. T-0593 is simply the run that hit the wall, exactly as
# T-0317 was at 25 and T-0379 at 28.
#
# WHAT THIS UNIT ADDS, AND WHY IT CANNOT BE TRIMMED INTO 944 BYTES. Re-dealing lot 7 of
# block 16 from a D3 cottage to an H1 house publishes 22,285 bytes net: the new roof and
# its sidecar in place of the old (+13,761), the yard fences and dooryard stems the
# larger footprint re-derives (+911), the ruling L222 in liberties.json (+7,655), the
# release entry in its two published copies (+5,414), and 7,404 bytes of sidecars that
# were STALE ON DEV and that any PR touching compile_scene.py has to carry. Everything
# in that list is either derived geometry or reasoning. The two prose items together are
# 13,069 bytes against an overflow of 21,341, so deleting BOTH of them entirely — the
# liberty that records the invention and the note that tells a visitor what changed —
# would still leave the tree 8,272 bytes over. Going further would have meant deleting
# reasoning rather than de-duplicating it, which is what the 28 -> 32 note refused, for
# the same reason, and it is refused again here.
#
# WHAT SUPPORTS 36. The LFS clause at the top is still the real constraint and it is
# about FORMAT: the tree holds plain binaries at 36 MiB exactly as it did at 25. Pages
# allows 1 GB a site, so this is under 4 % of what the host permits, and
# docs/RENDERING.md § the gate table has recorded a sanctioned raise to ~100 MB at H2
# since the rendering plan was written. It restores 3.98 MiB of headroom — more than
# either previous raise bought, 2.85 then 3.52 — which is the first raise in the three
# to leave room for a year of releases rather than a season of them.
#
# WHAT WILL EXHAUST IT AGAIN, NAMED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED. The same two items the last
# raise named, both still open and both now larger: the duplicated changelog is
# 2,753,794 bytes, 8.2 % of the tree and the fastest-growing item in it because it grows
# on every release rather than on every building (T-0364), and the letter-list cohort is
# 2.54 MiB (T-0438). Answering T-0364 alone would return more than two thirds of what
# this raise buys. Neither is answered here: a re-budget buys the time to answer them
# and is not an answer, and folding either into a ticket about a dwelling on Lake Street
# would be two units in one revert.

    `excluded` is a settled finding and a record is a settled decision. Between

    open. It has been four free-text sentences since the scaffold, read by
    nobody but an agent, and its own stated purpose — "listed here so nobody
    promotes them to documented without new evidence" — was a sentence with
    nothing behind it. One of the four IS in the dataset, so that sentence is
    checkable, and this checks it: an entry naming a committed record must say
    which of the record's claims carries the uncertainty, and that claim may not
    be `documented`. The day the evidence arrives, the promotion fails here and
    the entry has to be argued off this list rather than quietly outgrown.

    The other direction is the cheaper half and worth as much: an entry naming a
    structure that has since been built, still declaring itself unbuilt, would be
    the drift L12 was caught by — a document and its data disagreeing because
    nobody carried a change back.

    The named claim must also be one the provenance card RENDERS, which is the
    other half of the same promise. The Evidence panel's entry for a standing
    structure ends by telling a visitor that "the provenance card shows it" — a
    sentence about a surface this file could not see, which is exactly the shape
    of the two faults that cost this project a `documented_range` and an
    `asset_is_placeholder` that never rendered on any building. `carried_by` could
    have named a graded block the card has no section for, and the panel would
    have gone on promising it. The claim is now held to `CARD_CLAIM_PATHS`, and
    each of those paths is held to being one the card really reads.

    A question is required for the reason a reason is required on an exclusion:
    an id and a shrug is not a finding. `sources` are held to rule one like
    every other citation in this project, and an entry with none must SAY it has
    none and why — the escape hatch is a sentence a reader can weigh, not an
    empty array. The dossier pointer is checked to resolve to a committed file
    and to a line in it, because a pointer into research nobody can find is the

    panel it was read only by the generator, so none of it was ever checked.

    `source_id` resolves in `data/sources/`, and this was the second file after
    `exclusions.json` where nothing enforced it. A citation here could have named
    a source that never existed, and now a visitor reads these ids joined to
    their citations.

    one set. A gate walking its own copy would agree with the panel until a zone

    file's BYTES were the terrain's staleness hash, so a sentence of reasoning
    reported the ground as stale and could not land without a Blender bake. The
    rule was right, the data was short, and the gate one level down was charging a
    bake for prose. `generators/terrain_inputs.py` strips prose from the hash, the

      * tiers 5-6 "must never be the sole evidence for a `documented` attribute";
      * "no geometry is traced from them" — an outline "comes from tier-1 sheets
        or stays inferred".

    Both were written in the prose AND in `data/source.schema.json`, and until
    now neither was enforced anywhere: the word `tier` did not occur in this
    file. Every other rung of the confidence model has had a gate for weeks —
    `documented` owes a resolving source, `inferred` owes stated reasoning, an
    invention owes an admission — while the question those gates all assume an
    answer to, *how good is the source*, was checked by nobody.

    Two readings of the tier-5 rule appear in `docs/PROVENANCE.md` and they are
    not the same rule. The table says such a source may not be the SOLE evidence;
    the 2026-08-10 revision says a tier-5 map "never reaches it, alone or in
    company". The table's reading is the one enforced here, with reasons: the
    revision exists precisely to stop over-caution making the dataset less
    accurate, and forbidding a documented value from CITING a retrospective would
    punish corroboration — the opposite of what it was written for. A value
    carried by a period survey and cross-checked against a 1933 pictorial map is
    better evidenced than the same value with the map struck out.

    The third rule here is a warning, not an error, and it is the one with
    findings in it today. `documented` "still requires a period source"; the
    ladder puts first-hand and testimony-derived evidence at tiers 1-3 and later
    scholarly synthesis at 4. Values resting on nothing but tier 4 are counted
    and named rather than failed, because the fix is research and not a rename:
    either those values are over-graded or those sources are under-tiered — a
    page transcribing a period newspaper is tier 2 whatever the site hosting it
    is, and this dataset already grades one chicagology page that way. Regrading
    a confidence is also a mesh input, so the decision arrives with a bake
    attached. Priced and queued in `docs/STATUS.md` § 43.

    """A rung is a judgement about a document; this holds it to one.

    `check_evidence_ladder` asks what rung a claim rests on and takes the rung
    from the source record, where somebody typed it. Nothing ever asked what the
    number was a judgement ABOUT — which matters most for the modern pages that
    carry old documents, because there the number is not a judgement about the
    page at all. `chicagology_prefire252` is tier 2 because it prints an 1893
    Tribune retrospective; `chicagology_kinzie_bridge` is tier 3 because it
    prints Andreas, and its `note` said so in as many words — "Tier 3 for the
    Andreas transcription; the surrounding apparatus is a finding aid" — in a
    sentence no check could read. That is the shape of every fault this family of
    gates has found: a true sentence in a file, describing something nothing
    verified.

    So a record that dates its own RETRIEVAL rather than a document — `date`
    reading "accessed 2026-08-10" — and that claims a rung at or above
    `TESTIMONY_MAX_TIER` must declare `transcribes`: the documents it carries,
    each with its own date and its own rung, and each saying which of this
    project's claims it carries. The record's tier is then the best rung
    declared, derived rather than asserted, exactly as a changelog version is.

    Declare the documents the dataset DRAWS ON. A page also carrying a period
    city directory that no value here rests on is carrying apparatus, and
    apparatus goes in `note`; declaring it would claim, falsely, that a rung this
    dataset does not use is a rung it stands on.

    A page that has been READ and reprints nothing is the third state, and it
    needs a word of its own because it is indistinguishable here from a page
    nobody has opened — both declare nothing, and the count below would go on
    calling a read page unread, which is the sentence-nothing-can-see fault this
    whole family of gates exists to end. `wikipedia_chicago_river` is the case:
    it PARAPHRASES Swearingen's 1803 river soundings and footnotes them to a
    named reprinting, which is a citation and not a transcription. Such a record
    says so in `carries_no_document` — the reading, not a flag — and may not be
    graded at or above `TESTIMONY_MAX_TIER`, because there is no document on the
    page for the rung to be a judgement about.

    Two limits, both real and neither closable here. The check cannot read a
    transcription, so it cannot tell whether the document named actually says
    what the note claims — a human read is what put the entry there and a human
    read is what would overturn it. And it is per-record, while
    `check_evidence_ladder` is per-value: a source cited for corroboration on one
    attribute lends its rung to every attribute that lists it, so clearing a
    warning is not the same as improving the evidence for the value that carried
    it. `docs/RESEARCH/evidence_tiers_chicagology.md` walks the committed cases
    one at a time for exactly that reason.

    The confidence model answers "how sure are we of this value". It has nothing

    second is the reason this exists rather than the first:

    - A transcription slip in any of those sums is invisible. The numbers happen
      to be right; nothing was making them right.
    - **The module could not be changed.** `data/traces/street_control.json`
      records a live disagreement about the platted street width (80 ft
      annotated on Hathaway 1834, against Currey's 66 ft) whose consequence is
      2.13 m on every offset. Settling it against five paragraphs means five
      hand-redone sums and a reviewer with a calculator; settling it against one
      figure and this check means editing one number and reading which buildings
      moved.

    The rule runs in both directions, which is what stops the file going quietly
    out of date: a phase with coordinates and no `derivation` is an error, and a
    derivation naming control, a street, a kerb or an epoch that does not
    resolve is an error too. A placement no line in the dataset can check
    declares `not_derivable` and owes a reason — three of the nine do, and their
    reasons are the honest ones: no surviving street here, a position stacked on
    another inferred position, an interpolation plus a free 40 m.

        drawing one, whatever the record says about it;

    """Every inferred value in a record must be CLAIMED in LIBERTIES.md.

    This is the inverse of the check the walkthrough already makes. The panel and
    the provenance card report the liberties that were *recorded* — which is not
    the claim that everything taken was written down, and the project's standard
    is that a visitor can tell you which parts we made up. An inferred footprint
    is not merely an unknown: the polygon gets drawn, the building stands on it,
    and the visitor sees one specific shape. That is an invention, and an
    invention nobody wrote down is exactly the gap the standard is about.

    The same argument runs past the drawn geometry, which is why the requirement
    now covers every attested value in the record. An inferred `roof_type` is
    not an absence in the model: a gable gets built, and the visitor sees a gable.
    An inferred `gallery: false` is the same claim in the negative — the front
    of the building is rendered plain because nobody found evidence either way,
    and *that* is a decision a visitor cannot recover from a dithered tint. The
    confidence chip says "we do not know"; only the liberty says what we did about
    not knowing.

    So the confidence value drives the requirement, mechanically: mark anything
    inferred and the gate demands an entry whose `Covers:` field names that
    structure and that aspect. The claim is DECLARED, not inferred from the
    entry's wording. Reading the prose — the earlier rule — meant a liberty could
    discharge a footprint by mentioning the word while discussing a gallery, which
    is a coverage check that can be satisfied by an accident of phrasing.

    The claims are checked the other way too. A `Covers:` token that names no such
    structure, no such phase, or an attribute that is not inferred is an
    over-claim: the document says it admitted to something it did not, and that
    reads as diligence while providing none. Entries under **Resolved** are exempt
    from the last of those, because an append-only document has to be able to say
    "evidence settled this" without the settlement itself becoming a gate failure.

    **And the ground answers to all of it too.** Every paragraph above is about a
    building, because the check read `data/structures/` and nothing else. The
    terrain invents on the same terms and at a larger scale — a 6 m bank face
    nobody recorded, on every bank in the box, which is the piece of ground every
    visitor walks down to the water on — and none of that was demanded by a
    check: L32 and L33 were written by a person who noticed. A liberty owed by
    somebody's attention is precisely the arrangement this gate exists to
    replace. Ground claims are enumerated by the same function that puts them on
    the Evidence panel and claimed in a namespace of their own,
    `terrain.<epoch>.<claim>`, because the terrain is not a structure and the one
    document whose subject is honesty should not have to call it one.

    A regex over JavaScript is a blunt instrument and this one is deliberately

    else. A name is only followed when its path lands on a dict, so `const e =
    p.local_e` binds nothing further and a later unrelated `e` in the same file
    cannot be mistaken for it.

    `roots` is how a caller states a binding this scanner cannot infer. The
    per-structure sidecar needs none — `record.sidecar` names itself — but the
    derived documents are read as `doc` and then handed entry by entry to a
    renderer, where the name arrives as a function parameter and the anchor is
    gone. `check_derived_contract` declares those bindings rather than guessing
    them: `("doc", [])` for the document itself, `("claim", ["claims"])` for the
    parameter that holds one of its claims. Each is (identifier, path prefix),
    and it is a claim about the module that the gate's other direction then
    holds to the document.

    What it cannot see is stated rather than implied: a sidecar value handed to a
    function is read through that function's parameter, so `claimRow(label, span,
    range)` puts `range.confidence` out of reach. This finds the reads that name
    the field where the sidecar is in hand, which is where the field name is
    chosen and therefore where it can be wrong.

    Where it errs it errs loudly. Bind a name to a sidecar block and then reuse
    that name for an unrelated object in the same module, and this attributes the
    second object's fields to the sidecar and reports them missing. That is a
    false alarm a reader resolves in a minute by renaming the variable, and it is
    the direction to fail in: the alternative is the silence that let a card read
    a field nobody wrote for the life of the project.

    `check_position_derivations` recomputes each placement FROM the module. Nothing
    checked the module itself: 80 ft was an annotation read once during the datum work,
    a second source said 66, and the file recorded the disagreement and left it. The
    corridors are measured now (`data/traces/vectors/street_corridors_1834.json`,
    written by `tools/measure_street_widths.py`), and this is the offline half of that
    measurement — the half that runs on every commit, because the tool needs the network
    and a commit gate that needs the network fails for reasons that have nothing to do
    with the commit.

    Three things are held, and the third is the one with teeth:

    - **Every metre is re-derived from its pixels.** A corridor's width comes back out
      of the two committed boundary pixels through the sheet's own committed affine, and
      the summary comes back out of the corridor list. A metre edited by hand, or a
      median that no longer matches the readings under it, is an error — the same rule
      `tools/rederive_datum.py` applies to the origin.
    - **The adopted figure has to be the one the readings support.** `platted_street`
      may only carry the candidate nearest the measured median, and may not carry a
      candidate the readings exclude. Moving the module to 66 ft now fails here instead
      of moving five buildings quietly.
    - **The control-point finding may not go stale.** The measurement recorded that two
      GCPs sit inside a block rather than in the Canal Street corridor, and what it costs
      the datum to correct one of them. Both figures are pinned to the GCP pixels they
      were computed from, so the day somebody adopts either correction the gate fails
      until the sheet is read again. A finding whose inputs have moved is not a finding.

# --- the OTHER derived documents ------------------------------------------
#
# `sidecar_shape` says in as many words that it covers the per-structure sidecar
# and not `exclusions.json` or `terrain.json`, because those "have their own
# readers and their own shapes". That sentence has been true and unenforced
# since it was written, and it names precisely the interface the three faults of
# STATUS § 28-30 lived in: a field read and never emitted, a field emitted and
# never read, and a field that never entered the interface at all. Three
# documents were outside every one of those gates.
#
# The binding is DECLARED rather than inferred, and that is the whole design.
# A per-structure sidecar names itself — `record.sidecar` is an anchor a regex
# can follow. These are fetched into a local `doc` and then handed entry by
# entry to a renderer, so the field names are chosen inside a function whose
# parameter is `claim` or `ex` or `u`, with nothing left to anchor on. Writing
# the binding down is a claim about the module, and the gate then holds the
# module to it in both directions: a declared root that reads a field the
# document does not carry fails, and a field the compiler writes that no root
# reads must be declared internal with the reason.
#
# `internal` is § 48's partition arriving at a second family of documents. The
# bounded set there was the source schema; here it is what the compiler emits,
# which `compile_scene.py --check` and `compile_liberties.py --check` already
# prove is exactly what the dataset derives to.

    The two directions of `check_sidecar_contract` are *read and never emitted*
    (an error: the renderer reads undefined forever) and *emitted and never
    read* (a note: an unshipped claim). Neither can see the third kind, and the
    third kind is what happened here: `data/source.schema.json` grew
    `transcribes`, `carries_no_document`, `what_it_supplies` and
    `what_it_does_not_supply` — four fields whose own schema descriptions are
    addressed to a reader — and `cite()` never carried one of them into a
    sidecar. Nothing was broken. A shape unioned over what IS emitted cannot
    report what was never offered, and the compiler was consistent with itself,
    which is all `--check` proves.

    What makes the fault checkable is that the candidate set is bounded: it is
    the schema's own properties. So the partition is declared in
    `compile_scene.SOURCE_FIELD_SURFACE` and this holds it three ways.

    1. A schema property in neither half fails. That is the mechanism — a field
       added to a source record costs one line saying whether a visitor sees it,
       and the sentence has to be written by whoever knows the answer.
    2. A `visitor` field that some record carries and no compiled citation does
       fails. This is the check that was missing: it is exactly the state the
       dataset was in until today, for four fields and the life of the project.
    3. A `visitor` field never read by `renderers/web/js/citations.js` fails.
       The card is where the promise is kept, and one module renders every
       citation in this walkthrough — which is what makes the § 40 objection
       ("the scan cannot follow a value into a function") not bite here: the
       shape has one name and one renderer, so a member read is a real read.
       It is still a name scan and not dataflow, and that limit is why the
       smoke asserts the rendered card rather than trusting this.

    The reverse of 3 — a key emitted and never read — stays a note, as it is at
    the top level, because the honest response to it is a decision rather than
    an error.

    The four keyword arguments exist for the self-test and default to the
    committed halves; nothing in the suite passes them.

# fauna: zone records, presence modes, and the July gate

# The flora section above exists because a mid-July prairie is easy to render as
# a September one. This one exists for the mirror-image reason: a mid-July
# Chicago is easy to render as a May one. Every headline wildlife event in the
# record — passenger-pigeon flights, prairie-chicken booming, waterfowl clouds,
# the spring dawn chorus — is a spring, autumn or winter phenomenon, and 1 July
# is the QUIETEST wildlife date in the Chicago year. docs/research/08-fauna.md
# § 0.3 states that as guidance; the rules below make the wrong record
# unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged, exactly as the phenology gate
# does for the flora.
#
# The second thing this section enforces is that "present" and "visible" are
# different claims. Liberty L2 licenses fauna at low density and often as sound
# only, and that liberty is worth nothing unless the data can SAY "here, and not
# seen" — which is what `presence.mode` is for.

#
# TWO ORTHOGONAL AXES, AND THE WHOLE SECTION EXISTS BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT
# QUESTIONS. `confidence` is the project's per-attribute evidence grade and is
# checked by check_attested exactly as it is on a roof pitch. `grade` belongs to
# a PERSON and says how much of that person is reconstructed:
#
#   documented  a source names this person
#   derived     a real, named person whose details are partly reconstructed
#   inferred    a hypothesised resident filling a demonstrable need of the town
#
# The word "recommended" is NOT in this vocabulary. The programme was renamed
# away from it on 2026-08-13 and the rename is enforced by name below, because a
# vocabulary that merely omits a word gets it back the first time somebody
# copies an older file.
#
# The gate that actually protects the scene is the arrival date. A person who
# arrived in September 1835 is not in a scene set on 1 July 1835, and the
# failure mode is silent: nothing about a household record looks wrong when its
# subject was still in Vermont. Arrival values carry a `precision` because the
# sources give years far more often than days - and one of those precisions,
# `either_of_two_days`, exists for a source that gives two and declines to pick.
# The rule is asymmetric on
# purpose - the EARLIEST day a value permits must not be after the scene date
# (an error), and a value whose LATEST day is after it earns a warning rather
# than a failure, because "1835" with no month is a real state of the evidence
# and not a mistake.

# household records had nowhere to live but a free-text note, which is to say
# nowhere a query can reach it — and the households this project most needs to
# keep apart are exactly the ones a shared surname makes mergeable. Four
# household cards in this dataset are Kinzies — six until T-0839 folded two
# duplicate initials cards on 2026-09-05; `data/research/books/crosswalk.json`
# already has to refuse "Mr. John Kinzie" the elder against John Harris Kinzie
# his son, and a household set recording no Kinzie relationship at all offers
# that refusal no support.
#
# A `kin` row is an ordinary graded claim block — `value` names the OTHER
# person, so walk_attested checks its confidence, sources and note exactly as
# it checks an arrival — plus three fields that make it a link: `person` (whose
# relative this is, in THIS household), `household` (where the other person
# lives) and `relation` (the term, from the closed set below).
#
# TWO RULES, AND BOTH EXIST BECAUSE HALF IS THE POINT. Hurlbut's note says HALF
# brother — same father, different mothers — and that is the specific form a
# summary flattens to "brother" the first time nobody is watching. So the
# vocabulary keeps the degrees apart, and:
#
#   * a relation is only legal against its declared inverses, which for a
#     sibling link is a sibling link OF THE SAME DEGREE. A half brother whose
#     mirror row says plain brother is the flattening, caught.
#   * every row is RECIPROCAL. A kinship written on one record and not the
#     other is half a fact: the household you read second still says the two
#     men were unrelated, which is the defect T-0597 was opened about.
#
# THE ASYMMETRIC RELATIONS, ADDED AS PAIRS (T-0734). Until this ticket the set
# was siblings alone, on the rule that "a relation whose inverse is unknown
# cannot be checked for reciprocity ... add the pair together or not at all".
# That rule is kept and satisfied rather than relaxed: `husband` is declared
# WITH `wife`, and the parent terms WITH the child terms, so every relation
# below still has a mirror this file can demand and check. What made them
# askable was the corpus — the St Cyr register marries six couples this town
# holds both halves of, and buries an infant it names the father of, and the
# household records had no way to say so. A relation is still refused outright
# unless its inverse appears here; uncle/nephew and cousin remain undeclared
# because nothing in the corpus has needed them yet.

# two words is right is a fact about the OTHER person's sex, and the register
# that states the tie usually states that too.

    """Can the bake rebuild everything the staleness gate holds it responsible for?

    The staleness gate above hashes `generators/build.py` into every asset, so a
    one-line comment in that file restales all 343 buildings and the remedy is a
    full rebake. That remedy has to be able to reach every asset it is asked to
    heal — and for one of them it could not.

    `build.py` walks `data/structures/` and resolves each record's phase against the
    SCENE's target date; a record no phase covers is skipped, printed as
    *"skip: no phase covers ..."*, and built by nothing. The first Cook County
    court-house is such a record: Andreas dates it to the fall of 1835 and the only
    scene targets 1 July, so `build.py --only cook_county_courthouse_1835` builds
    nothing — while its GLB was committed, was in the manifest, and WAS hashed by
    the staleness gate like every other asset. Editing `build.py` therefore staled
    an asset that the rebake could not then refresh, and the tree could not be made
    green by any committed route. It cost two runs their intended change (T-0008
    monkey-patched `resolve_phase` from a throwaway script; T-0015 reverted a
    demonstrated export guard rather than do that twice) before it was written down
    as T-0139.

    So the rule this asserts is the one that was being assumed: **a committed,
    input-tracked asset must be reachable by the bake.** Reachable means some scene
    in `data/scenes/` resolves that structure's phase — the same rule `build.py` and
    `validate_scene` apply, restated on the asset side.

    It is deliberately the mirror image of `check_drawn_by`'s "no GLB survives the
    move": that one catches geometry that outlived its build instructions, this one
    catches geometry no build instruction reaches. Both say a committed mesh must
    have a live route back to the data.

    Three ways to satisfy it, and the choice is the author's: give the scene set a
    date that covers the phase, teach `build.py` to take a phase explicitly, or stop
    committing the asset. T-0139 took the third for the court-house, because the
    scene already reports it as *"1 excluded by date"* and nothing loads it.
