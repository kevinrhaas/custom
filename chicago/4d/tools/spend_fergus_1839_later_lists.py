"""Fergus 1839's two LATER lists, spent on the people they name (T-0635, consolidation pass 2).

    python3 tools/spend_fergus_1839_later_lists.py             write the ledger and the cards
    python3 tools/spend_fergus_1839_later_lists.py --check     everything re-derives; nothing drifted
    python3 tools/spend_fergus_1839_later_lists.py --report    person by person, which list meets them
    python3 tools/spend_fergus_1839_later_lists.py --self-test the rules below, held over what it derives

WHY THIS EXISTS. T-0634 was consolidation pass 1 and spent the town's own rolls of
1833-1835. This is pass 2, and its window opens where pass 1 closed. Two crosswalks landed
in that window whose rulings name a person in this town and had never reached that person's
card:

    fergus_1839_election_crosswalk_1835.json   T-0664   86 residents matched
    fergus_1839_register_crosswalk_1835.json   T-0665   15 residents matched

Both were read out of the same volume — Fergus' Chicago Directory for 1839 — and both are
LATER evidence read backwards. The election is the poll of Chicago's first city election,
2 May 1837, printed pages 40-46. The register is the city register of 1839 and the printed
tables of mayors and sheriffs, printed pages 38-39. Neither is an 1835 fact and neither may
ever become one; what each is, is a SECOND INDEPENDENT BOOK meeting a name this project
holds, which is the thing the ratified ladder asks for and the thing 92.8% of this town's
records did not have.

WHY THE MEASURE SAID ZERO. `tools/measure_research_spend.py`'s second hop reported
directories at 0 unwritten while these 101 rulings sat unspent, and the reason is a defect
in the instrument rather than a fact about the domain: both files put their rulings one
level down, under `residents.matches`, and the hop only walked lists that were direct
values of the document. It could not see them. T-0635 repairs that descent in the same PR;
this tool is what the repaired number is then paid down with.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT WRITTEN, in four rules — pass 1's rules, unchanged, because the defect
they guard against is the same one.

  1. ONLY WHAT THE CROSSWALK ALREADY DECLARED. This pass re-adjudicates nothing. It reads
     the `residents.matches` rows and writes those. `contested`, `ambiguous` and the
     surname-only refusals are rivals still standing and write nothing; the voter,
     letter-list and 1840-head pools name a row in another reading rather than a card in
     this town, and this pass does not touch them.

  2. TWO FIELDS AND NO OTHERS. A person gains the source id in `sources` and a paragraph in
     `note`. Nothing else is touched — not a grade, not an arrival, not a claim block, not
     a placement, and above all not `present_on_scene_date`. `--self-test` holds that by
     diffing a record through the applier and asserting the changed key set.

  3. NO GRADE MOVES, and here the crosswalks themselves forbid it. Each carries a
     `carry_rule` saying in its own words that a later appearance is corroboration of
     CONTINUED RESIDENCE and not of July 1835, and that the person's grade does not move on
     it alone. That sentence is quoted onto every card this pass writes, so the limit
     travels with the evidence. T-0515 applies the ladder against every source at once.

  4. ONE PARAGRAPH PER PERSON, NOT PER ENTRY. A man who voted in 1837 and held an office in
     1839 is named in one paragraph naming both, with the claim id each was read into, so
     nothing is lost by the fold.

THE LEDGER IS NOT A CROSSWALK, deliberately, and for the reason pass 1 gave:
`data/research/directories/fergus_1839_later_spend_1835.json` carries no "crosswalk" in its
name so that `measure_research_spend.py` does not read a record of WRITES as a second
adjudication and report the pass grading its own homework.
