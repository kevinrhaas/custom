"""Audit every graded value in the dataset against what the three levels MEAN.

The three levels are not a scale of how sure we feel. They name three different
acts, and each one implies things that can be checked:

  attested       A source STATES this value.
                 -> It must cite at least one source.
                 -> Its own note must not say the sources are silent on it.

  inferred       Reasoned from evidence about THIS PARTICULAR THING — a described
                 location, a measured lot, a neighbouring record.
                 -> There must be reasoning: a note saying what was reasoned from.
                 -> It cannot sit on a structure that is itself an invention,
                    because then there is no "this particular thing" to reason about.

  reconstructed  Invented to fill a demonstrable need; no source speaks to it.
                 -> It MAY cite sources: an invention bounded by a source is
                    defensible rather than arbitrary, and the bound is worth
                    showing. So a citation here is not an error.
                 -> But if a source flatly states the value, the grade is too low.

The rule that matters most, and the one this was written for: EVERY VALUE ON AN
INVENTED STRUCTURE IS RECONSTRUCTED. A typology — what a shoemaker's shop of the
period was ordinarily like — is evidence about a KIND, not about a building, and
the building is not there. Grading those as `inferred` made 158 structures that
never existed render solid in the confidence view while the Exchange Coffee
House, a real tavern with a name and a keeper, rendered as a dithered ghost
because its wall height is honestly unknown. The view told the visitor the exact
opposite of the truth.

Run bare to report; `--strict` exits non-zero on any error, which is how
tools/check.sh consumes it.
