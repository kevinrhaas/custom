"""The one sampling rule: a family's authored band, and how an instance is drawn from it.

`data/reconstruction/1835_family_archetype_crosswalk.json` authors, per family, the
footprint band, the storey count, the eave band and the placeholder archetype. This
module is the single place that reads them and the single place that turns a band into
an instance's dimensions.

It exists because the same arithmetic was in two files and only one of them ran it.
`tools/generate_block_infill.py` samples inside the band, so its twelve blocks carry a
size distribution; `tools/generate_north_infill.py` retyped one value per family into
Python, so its sixty roofs were the same building sixty times (ROADMAP T-V1). Uniformity
is itself a claim and no source makes it, so the rule moved here and both parcels import
it rather than one of them owning it.

**Sampling adds variety, not knowledge.** Every value it returns is an invention bounded
by the family band; it grades at the bottom tier wherever it lands, exactly as the
constant it replaced did. What changes is that the band is now used as the range it was
authored as instead of being collapsed to a point.

# sampling a pitch without looking at what it does to the RIDGE moves the fault
# one field over. The crosswalk authors both — `roof` carries a rise:run band and

# together. So the sampler here is CONSTRAINED: it samples inside the pitch band,
# but where part of that band would put the ridge outside the family's own
# `ridge_ft`, it samples from the part that does not.
#
# WHAT IT WILL NOT DO. It will not leave the pitch band to reach a ridge band, in
# either direction. The pitch band is a claim about the roofs of a building type
# and the ridge band is another; where the archetype's own geometry cannot satisfy
# both — a narrow-fronted outbuilding whose ridge runs across its short axis
# cannot reach a ridge band written for a house's span at ANY pitch the family
# allows — the sampler stays inside the pitch band and the residual is reported by
# `tools/measure_ridge_band.py` rather than hidden by a pitch nobody claims. A

# `wall_height_m` draws the eave first and draws it free, and once a low eave is
# drawn there may be no pitch inside the family's band that reaches the family's
# ridge band at all. The gate then reports a roof outside its ridge band and the
# fault reads as a conflict between two committed claims, when what actually
# happened is that the sampler asked the second claim to carry the first one's
# choice.
#
# It is not a conflict. `tools/measure_ridge_reach.py` sweeps every family's
# authored footprint band and asks whether ANY (eave in band, pitch in band) reaches
# the ridge band: for every family the crosswalk authors a pitch band for, at every
# footprint in its band, the answer is yes. The four claims — footprint, eave, pitch,
# ridge — are jointly satisfiable everywhere, so nothing in the specification has to
# give way. What gives way is the sampler's ORDER, and only where it has to.

# WHAT THIS DOES, and what it deliberately does not do. The eave is sampled exactly
# as before, from the part of the authored band the archetype can build. Where the
# value drawn cannot reach the ridge band at any pitch the family allows, it is HELD
# at the nearest eave inside its own authored band that can — the same reading
# `eave_floor` and `eave_limits` already take at the two ends of the band, and the
# same discipline `pitch_deg` takes on the pitch: shrink to the part of the band that
# satisfies the other committed claim, never leave the band to satisfy it. A held
# value is still inside the band its note cites, so the note stays true and
# `tools/measure_band_claims.py` keeps passing it. Where no eave in the band can
# reach the ridge band either, nothing is held and the residual is the gate's to
