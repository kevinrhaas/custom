WHAT THIS STAGE IS. The order book carries twenty-four buckets whose axis reads
`family/trade` — an adult in a family household who works at something — and every one of
them is short. 308 people across the three civil divisions, 197 men and 111 women, and no
roster of 1835 Chicago prints them: the letter lists name merchants and the subscription
rolls name subscribers, and the men who dug the harbour and drove the drays and the women
who kept the boarding houses and sewed for the town were never written down. This stage
draws them as HEADS OF THEIR OWN HOUSEHOLDS, each with a trade, a name from the pools, an
age band from the bucket that ordered them. No arrival: that table is computed over the
scene these cards are overlaid into, so drawing from it here would move the table that drew
them, and the research layer's own arrival fills (T-1169) re-derive from it.

WHERE THE TRADES COME FROM, AND WHAT IS NOT DONE WITH THEM. T-1346 counted every printed
trade in the Fergus 1839 directory against this project's controlled vocabulary — 1,377
mapped entries over 88 trades — and that table is the only per-trade share the corpus
yields. The table's own `how_to_use_it` says what this stage does with it: draw from
`rows`, renormalised over the trades being drawn for, and never write a trade whose
`in_vocabulary` is false. The 1839 shape is FOUR YEARS LATE and this stage does not hide
that: it is the shape of the town the same people built, read back onto the year they
were building it, and the ledger says so beside every count.

FOUR REFUSALS, EACH ONE WRITTEN RATHER THAN QUIETLY TAKEN.

  1. NO SENIORITY RULE. T-1173's rules sketched "labourers young, master tradesmen
     older", and this stage does not take it. The 1839 table carries no ages and the 1840
     schedule carries no trades, so nothing in this corpus prices the association; a
     seniority curve drawn here would be a liberty invented to make a table look like a
     town. Each trade is dealt across the age bands in proportion to the bands the order
     book actually ordered, and the master/journeyman split is T-1183's, which is the
     ticket that models how a business was staffed.

  2. NO KIN. Every drawn head is owed a family — the 1840 size histogram says a Chicago
     household of that year held 4.4 people — and this stage writes the size it is owed
     onto the card and seats nobody in it. The kin of a family household are
     `family/none` in the order book and that quota is T-1174's and T-1171's, not this
     stage's: drawing them here would order the same 930 women and children twice, which
     is the one arithmetic the book exists to prevent. `household_owed` carries the drawn
     size, the seed that drew it and the ticket that seats it.

  3. NO ARRIVAL. The arrival model's `arrival_year_of_the_known_layer` is derived from the
     compiled scene and the scene carries these cards, so an arrival written here moves the
     table that drew it — and T-1169's fills over 1,440 research cards re-derive from that
     table, so the whole research layer would move under a stage that is not supposed to
     touch it. The block says so and names the stage that owns it.

  4. NO TRADE PAST ITS CEILING. Where the December 1835 State census counts a class one
     person keeps — fourteen physicians, twenty-two lawyers, four druggists — the town
     model's own `against_the_state_census` table says how many more the town is short,
     and this stage may not draw past that number. A class the town already matches draws
     nobody. The count a ceiling refuses is not lost: it falls to the RESIDUAL trade, and
     the ledger prints the arithmetic rather than absorbing it.

THE RESIDUAL. Day labour for the men and domestic service for the women. Neither is an
establishment, so neither is enumerated by a census that counts stores and shops, and
neither advertises, subscribes or signs; they are the work the record cannot see, and a
model that let the directory's shares stand unadjusted would give this town more printers
than labourers. The residual is where the ceilings' refusals go and where the rounding
remainder goes, and the ledger states it as a number, not as a rule.

WHERE THE CARDS LIVE. `data/residents/reconstructed_trades/`, beside T-1172's
`readmitted/` and for the same reason: `data/residents/households/` is re-derived by the
research mints and `data/residents/index.json` is derived from that directory, so a
reconstruction that is not a reading lives outside both and is overlaid onto the scene by
`tools/compile_scene.py`. Nothing here reaches back into a research card.

EVERY VALUE IS REPRODUCIBLE. Nothing is random: each value comes from `blake2s(seed)` over
a seed a reader can retype, and the seed is printed on the record that carries the value.
`--check` re-derives the whole directory and refuses a single differing byte.

README = """# data/residents/reconstructed_trades/

DERIVED. Written by `tools/reconstruct_trade_households.py --build` (T-1347, of T-1173),
the `trade_households` stage of the 1835 resident reconstruction programme. Do not
hand-edit a card here: `--check` re-derives the whole directory and refuses a differing
byte, and `tools/check.sh` runs it.

Every person here is `grade: reconstructed` and **nobody in this directory is named by any
source**. They exist because the order book counts the town of 1 July 1835 as short of
that many adults at a trade in that division, and each card says on its face which bucket
ordered it, which seed drew every value and what evidence would retire the person.

The directory is deliberately OUTSIDE `data/residents/households/`, for the reason
`readmitted/` is: that directory is re-derived by the research mints and
`data/residents/index.json` is derived from it, so a reconstruction that is not a reading
lives here and is overlaid onto the scene by `tools/compile_scene.py`.
