"""Fix cohorts 13, 14 and 15 — the named residents that have no research row.

    tools/select_resident_research_pass_13.py            (re)write the manifest
    tools/select_resident_research_pass_13.py --gate     the committed manifest is current

T-0492 fixes all three here, in one file, so that T-0508, T-0509 and T-0510 do not
edit `tools/check.sh` and the same population frame at the same moment in three
parallel runs. `_14.py` and `_15.py` are two lines each and import this.

WHAT THE FRAME ACTUALLY IS, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSERTED. The ticket asks for 237
named people with no research row, in three cohorts of 79. The tree holds **228**,
and the arithmetic is worth writing down because the difference is not rounding:

    238  people carrying no `resident_research` block at all
     -5  unnamed placeholders ("The rest of the Beaubien household, unnamed" and
         four like it) — a count, not a person, and outside every cohort since the
         pilot
     -5  real named people whose ids and containers are `inf_*` / `hh_inf_*`
         (J. Garland, J. W. Reed, Dr. Josiah C. Goodhue, Thomas S. Eels,
         J. Shrigley), retained unplaced by T-0489. `select_resident_research_pass_5.py`
         refuses an `inf_` id outright and this follows it. They are real people and
         they are worth researching; that is a ticket, not a silent inclusion here.
    ---
    228  = 76 + 76 + 76

AND WHERE THEY COME FROM, WHICH IS THE SURPRISE. 225 of the 228 are the **pilot,
pass 2 and pass 3 cohorts** — reserved, and never researched: no findings ledger,
no reference package, no row on any person. That is T-0511's finding from the other
side. So T-0492's acceptance clause "zero overlap with passes 1-12" cannot be met
as written — the population that satisfies it is THREE PEOPLE — and the non-overlap
that carries the meaning is stated instead:

  * zero overlap AMONG 13, 14 and 15;
  * zero overlap with the 611 people who DO carry a research row, which is passes
    4-12 and the reference packages behind them.

Researching a person the pilot reserved in June and never reviewed is the work the
owner asked for. Refusing to, because a reservation exists, is how 225 people stay
unresearched for ever.

THE FRAME IS FROZEN, and deliberately. It was measured on 2026-09-03 against
`data/residents/households/*.json`, sorted inside each stratum, round-robin
interleaved across the three strata and chunked in fixed order. A person who
acquires a research row after this — which is what T-0508 to T-0510 are for — does
NOT make the manifest stale; a person who VANISHES, or turns into a placeholder,
does, and the gate says so.
