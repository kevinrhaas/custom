"""Seat the Michigan St tract's platted grid on the committed town grid.

    tools/seat_michigan_st_tract.py            print what it would write
    tools/seat_michigan_st_tract.py --write    write the streets file and the seating
    tools/seat_michigan_st_tract.py --check    the committed lines still re-derive

The reading is `data/traces/michigan_st_tract_grid.json` (T-1076) and none of it is
repeated here. That reading identified the tract's two streets: its east-west street,
the one Wright letters `Michigan St`, is Kinzie's Addition's Michigan Street, and its
north-south street is Market Street carried north. This tool takes the LADDER out of
that reading — how far each ruled line stands from those two streets, measured inside
one corner of one raster — and hangs it on the two committed lines the reading named,
`michigan_north` and `market_north`.

WHY NOT COMMIT THE PIXELS. Because the sheet's fit is local, and at this tract it is
badly local. Wright's fit puts Michigan Street 99 m north of the
committed Kinzie line here; the committed grid, which takes that tier from the Thompson
plat and from modern control over a baseline four times longer, puts it at 138 m. The
plat draws exactly ONE tier of North Division blocks in that span, so it has to hold a
block plus an 80 ft street — 453 ft does and 328 ft does not. The sheet is compressed in
y at its western margin, and the tract is seated on the grid rather than on the fit — the same trade `tools/seat_kinzie_addition_streets.py` makes, at three times
the size.

THE COST IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. Seated, the tract's south border stands 60.5 m
north of Kinzie Street where the sheet's fit draws 22.0 m. That 38.5 m is Wright's
compression, not a fact about the tract, and it is the reason this tool exists instead
of a paste of `local_enu_m` values. The alternative — hanging the ladder on `kinzie`
instead, whose drawn position the sheet does get right — would place a SECOND Michigan
Street 38 m south of the committed one, which is precisely what the reading refuses.

Nothing here is fitted to modern pavement and nothing is chosen to look right.
