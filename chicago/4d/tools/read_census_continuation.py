"""read_census_continuation.py — the row grid and the glyph boxes of an 1840
continuation sheet, measured off the image rather than judged by eye.

## Why this exists

The right-hand (continuation) sheet of the 1840 population schedule carries the
numbers rather than the names: twelve slave columns, the family TOTAL, seven
industry columns, pensioners, ten deaf/dumb/blind/insane columns and seven
schools columns. T-0535's reading of `33S7-9YYJ-24` closed against all five of
that sheet's printed column totals in four passes and was taken as the price of
a sheet. It was not: T-0538 and T-0541 were both split when the estimate broke,
and the reason T-0541 recorded is the one this file answers.

**These sheets are not ruled across.** The reading of `33S7-9YYJ-5V` measured it:
a row-darkness profile taken through the empty slaves block finds exactly two
strong horizontal rules on the leaf — under the printed heading and above the
enumerator's footer — and the largest excess over local background anywhere
between them is 4 grey levels, against 77 to 211 for those two. The printed form
rules the page vertically only. So there is no grid to count rows against, and
every row assignment has to come from the enumerator's own ink.

Which made the reading a matter of opinion, sheet after sheet, and produced the
disagreement this tool exists to end: the ink of one sheet's TOTAL column
clusters into 31 groups at one threshold and 28 at another, and `coverage.json`
had 28 "to the nearest line" from an inventory pass. Nothing said which was
right, because nothing was reproducible.

## What it measures, and what it refuses to do

It measures three things and prints them, and every one of them is re-derivable
from the committed image with no numbers typed in:

1. **The column geometry.** Vertical printed rules, found as a column-darkness
   profile over the body band. The eight single-width columns of the middle of
   the form — TOTAL and the seven industry columns — are then named off the
   pitch of those rules and the wide cells that bracket the run; pitch alone is
   not enough, and locate_columns() records why.
2. **The ink of each column**, as a local-background-subtracted mask. A flat
   global threshold does not work on these leaves: the exposure falls off two
   grey levels per hundred pixels toward the gutter, so ink at the right edge is
   paler than paper at the left. The background is a 25-pixel Gaussian of the
   crop itself and the mask is what stands 45 levels darker than it.
3. **The glyph components** of each column: 8-connected components of that mask,
   after a 5x5 closing to join a stroke a scan has broken, filtered to those at
   least 40 pixels in area and 12 pixels tall. Each is reported as a box.

**It does not read digits, and it must not.** A tool that guessed at a `4` that
is two strokes reading as `11`, or at a `7` and a `9` that differ by a loop,
would launder a guess into a measurement — which is the one thing this project's
provenance rule forbids. The boxes are the measurement; a human reads the digit
in the box, at magnification, against the glyph forms the sheet's own footer
row calibrates.

## The grouping rule, which is the actual finding

A number is one line's entry. Two components belong to the same number when the
hand has not gone back to the left of the cell for a new one: the y centres are
within `--group-dy` (55 px, against a line pitch measured at 58-90 on 5V) AND x
does not step back. That rule, and nothing else, produces the group count. The
count it produces is reported WITH the alternatives at the neighbouring
thresholds, because a count that changes with the threshold is a range and
saying so is the honest form of the answer.

Row identity is then ANCHORED, where it can be, by cross-column coincidence: an
entry in the commerce, manufactures or learned-professions column sits on the
same line as the TOTAL group it coincides with in y, and those coincidences are
independent of any threshold. On 5V, 22 lines are anchored that way. They are
the committed part of the row grid; the bands between them are named as open.
