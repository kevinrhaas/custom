"""Keep another resident pass's findings when a mint rebuilds its own card (T-1137).

    python3 tools/resident_mint_carry.py --self-test

THE BOUNDARY IS A WRITER-OWNED MARKER, not the mint's entire derived note.  Every pass
that appends prose to ``persons[].note`` already writes a stable ``MARKER`` so its own
once-each gate can find the paragraph.  That same marker is the honest boundary for a
mint: everything from the first foreign marker onward is appended evidence, even when
the prose the mint derives before it has changed.

The old prefix test survives only as a compatibility path for an unchanged derived
note carrying an older, unmarked suffix.  If both the derived prose and an unmarked
suffix change, there is no safe boundary to infer and this module refuses to guess.
New appenders are discovered from the same source shape as ``spend_write_once.py``;
the two old-settler markers predate the ``spend_`` convention and are included by name.

The note is only one co-owned field.  Consolidation passes also add household blocks,
person evidence, citations, a ladder rule, and ``occupation.later_occupation``.  This
module carries those in the same fixed slots the four mints already use, while callers
name optional fields they themselves own so an old derivation cannot resurrect one.
