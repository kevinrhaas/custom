"""What a ONE-LETTER CANDIDATE TEST would propose over the town's cards (T-1002).

THE QUESTION, and T-0961 found it the hard way. `clusters()` in
`tools/consolidate_town_cards.py` buckets the town's cards by the SURNAME AS A STRING and
then lets `compatible()` weigh the forenames — a full word against the same word, an
initial the word begins with, or a card that prints a title and no forename at all.
Nothing in that test admits a LETTER. So three duplicate pairs the project holds were
never proposed to it, not refused and not deferred:

    beaubien_madore     Madore Benjamin Beaubien   / beaubien_medore_b   Medore B Beaubien
    clybourne_archibald Archibald Clybourne        / clybourn_archibald  Archibald Clybourn
    heacock_russel_e    Russel E. Heacock          / heacock_russell_e   Russell E Heacock

and each was found by hand, by one afternoon's reading of one table. The forty-one
clusters `data/residents/card_merge_rulings.json` holds are the pairs the string test
could see, and that file had no way to say how many it could not. This tool is the way.

WHAT IT DOES. It runs the candidate test again with one letter of slack — Levenshtein
distance exactly 1, the same `one_letter_apart()` T-1001 wrote and `check.sh` already
gates — on the SURNAME, and on the first forename token where the surname is exact. Then
it subtracts the pairs the exact test already proposes, and prints what is left. It is a
MEASUREMENT and not a proposal: nothing here changes `clusters()`, and running it changes
no committed file.

THE ANSWER IT GIVES, measured on the tree that shipped T-1002 — quoted rather than gated
for equality, because the residents layer grows on almost every ticket:

    1,376 cards that name somebody
       21 pairs the exact candidate test already proposes
       71 pairs a one-letter test would ADD — 63 on the surname, 8 on the forename
       12 of those 71 already carry a written ruling, T-1002's three among them

SO THE CLASS IS NOT THREE, AND IT IS NOT THE 71 EITHER. Read the list and it falls into
three kinds that want three different answers, which is why T-1002 rules its three and
sends the rest to an epic rather than folding on a distance:

  * A SPELLING THE SOURCES REALLY DO SET TWO WAYS — Clybourn/Clybourne, Foot/Foote,
    Forsyth/Forsythe, Lloyd/Loyd, Pearson/Pearsons, Pruyne/Pryne, Eldredge/Eldridge,
    Wesencraft/Wessencraft. These are the C7/C9 shape and each needs its own page.
  * A CARD MINTED OFF A GARBLE — `chark_john_a` for Clark, `tmple_john_t` for Temple,
    `smow_george_w` for Snow, `canp_george_s` for Camp, `mgregor_a` for McGregor,
    `blanshard_f_g` for Blanchard. R5 refuses these by rule and T-0695 is the ticket that
    reads them; a fold here would repair a wreck by guessing at it.
  * AN INITIAL GATHERED ACROSS A FOLDED SURNAME — J. Green against Major John Greene,
    J. B. Falker against James Walker, J. Ambrose Wight against three Wrights. The slack
    is on the surname and the forename inference is `compatible()`'s own, so the test
    cannot decline it; what it means in practice is that a fold on the surname multiplies
    the initials it reaches, and R2's two-rivals refusal is doing most of the work.
  * TWO PEOPLE ONE LETTER APART — J. H. Collins against John Rollins, John Hale against
    John Vale, Mark Noble against Mary Noble, James Sheldon against James Wheldon. A
    distance cannot tell these from the first kind, and that is the whole argument for
    ruling a cluster on a page instead of on a distance. T-1001 measured the same thing
    over the land register and answered NO for the same reason.
