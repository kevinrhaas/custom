"""Expand the inferred-household programme: people, adoptions, and new buildings.

    python3 tools/generate_inferred_households.py --check    re-derive and diff

Phase two of docs/ROADMAP.md K1. Phase one wrote the town's DOCUMENTED and DERIVED
people and deliberately wrote no inferred ones; this expands
`data/reconstruction/1835_inferred_household_programme.json` into

  * `data/residents/households/hh_inf_*.json` — one file per inferred household,
    every person graded `inferred`, none of them named;
  * `data/residents/index.json` — the manifest's household rows and counts, and
    the five documented households whose buildings this parcel finally builds;
  * `data/structures/*.json` — the new records: the seven documented buildings
    phase one found with no record, and the inferred workplaces and dwellings the
    occupation census requires.

The adopted anonymous roofs are NOT written here. They belong to the two
anonymous-infill generators, which read `tools/inferred_occupancy.py` for the
occupancy block so their own byte-for-byte drift check keeps working.

WHAT THIS FILE WILL NOT DO. It will not invent a name: every inferred person
carries a designation and says in its note that it is a hypothesis. It will not
grade an invention `inferred` to make a gate pass: a position nobody recorded is
`conjectural` here exactly as it is on every other record in the dataset, and it
owes docs/LIBERTIES.md a `Covers:` token like any other invention.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Most of this layer's roofs stand on free ground: a frontage-band assignment, tested
# for clearance and buildable ground, and written into the programme as a centre. Two
# of them do not. `inf_bakery_lake` and `inf_butcher_market` front the north face of
# `blk_lake_clark`, and `recon_1835_south_d3_013` declares a shared party wall with the
# butcher — a claim about one wall, made from the other side.
#
# Written as centres they could not honour it. Both were authored at bearing 0 where
# that face runs at 0.465, so their front walls landed 0.804 m and 0.784 m off the
# committed boundary against the 0.800 m the seven frontage records on the face stand
# at: near the line, parallel to nothing, and by arithmetic nobody re-derived. The
# party wall was 16 mm open and `tools/measure_street_line.py` had to bank it by name.
#
# So a building here MAY declare a face instead of a centre, and then it takes its
# line, its bearing and its outward offset from `data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json`
# — the committed plat, through the one `tools/block_faces.py` module both infill
# generators already read. What the programme still authors is where along that face
# the building's west wall stands, which is the same thing a frontage row authors as
# its corner clearance: an interpretive choice about which part of a street a made-up
# building occupies, expressed in the face's own frame rather than as a coordinate
# beside the plat.
#
# STANDING ON A DERIVED BLOCK FACE IS NOT STANDING ON A RECOVERED LOT. The buildings
# are still invented, their positions are still `reconstructed`, and the derivation
# block still says `not_derivable` — nothing here upgrades a confidence. It removes a
# hand-typed coordinate, which is the whole of the claim.
