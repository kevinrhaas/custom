"""The 1830 schedule and St Mary's register, written onto the cards they name (T-1330).

    python3 tools/spend_appearance_bounds.py             write the ledger and the bounds
    python3 tools/spend_appearance_bounds.py --check      everything re-derives; nothing drifted
    python3 tools/spend_appearance_bounds.py --report     person by person, what each row bounds
    python3 tools/spend_appearance_bounds.py --self-test  the rules below, held over what it derives

WHY THIS EXISTS. T-1326 wrote the town's own poll and tax rolls onto the 236 cards they
name, as `persons[].dated_bounds[]`, because a paragraph in `persons[].note` is not a field
and `tools/research_spend_ledger.py` counts a reading as SPENT only where a structured,
source-bearing, `attested`/`inferred` node NAMES the unit. Its sibling T-1329 held three
further corpora on the same footing and in a worse state: the 1830 Peoria & Putnam
schedule, St Mary's baptismal register, St Cyr's marriage pages and the town's press, 238
units, of which only ten sat on a card in any form at all. This pass is the register and
the schedule half of that — T-1330 — and unlike T-1326 it is NOT a legibility pass: an
identification has to already stand before a bound can be written, and where none does the
answer here is a written refusal in the ruling registers and no card is touched.

WHAT IT WRITES, AND THE TWENTY-SEVEN ROWS IT IS LIMITED TO. Two adjudications already made
elsewhere, read and never re-made:

  * `data/research/census_1830/resident_crosswalk.json` — `matched[]`, 14 rows, where the
    1830 reading and a town person agree on surname AND given name. That file REFUSES a
    surname-only agreement in writing (63 of them) and holds one surname-variant row as a
    declared candidate; neither reaches a card, here or anywhere.
  * `data/research/church/st_marys_baptisms_crosswalk.json` — the 13 register appearances
    whose ruling is `merged`, resolved to a person through that file's own `merges[]`,
    whose `into` name is looked up in the residents layer and must resolve to exactly one.

NOT ONE ROW COMES FROM ST CYR'S PAGES. That crosswalk proposes one merge and makes none:
its 13 units in this corpus are 10 declared candidates, one entry printed with a blank
where the forename stands, and two prose readings that bound the register rather than
populate it. A candidate is a rival still standing, and writing a bound off one would print
an undecided identity as a decided one. They are refused in
`tools/spend_remainder_rulings.py`, by name, with what would reopen them.

THE FOUR RULES THAT KEEP A ROW FROM SAYING MORE THAN IT CAN.

  1. THE 1830 LINE BOUNDS PRESENCE IN A DISTRICT AND NOT AT CHICAGO. The division is
     headed 'Peoria & Putnam Counties & Territory attached' and the schedule never writes
     the word Chicago; the Fox River and Du Page settlements are inside it. So an 1830 row
     carries `bound_kind: "district_presence"` and `here_by: null` — the same shape T-1117
     gave a tax row, for the same reason: the reading does not put a body in the town. The
     record's own note says it first ("Presence in that district in the summer of 1830; not
     a Chicago residence, and never an 1835 one") and this pass does not improve on it.

  2. A REGISTER APPEARANCE DOES BOUND A PRESENCE AT CHICAGO, on the day the entry is
     dated: the sponsor stood at the font, and every one of these records carries
     `at_chicago: true` and `cells.place` of Chicago, Cook County, Illinois.

  3. NO ROW IS `attested` AND NO ROW COVERS THE SCENE DATE. The pages are documented — the
     federal schedule off the scan, the register off the eleven deposited page images — and
     the IDENTITIES are not: each rests on a name agreement a crosswalk declared, and no
     source states that the man on the page is the person on the card. A bound whose
     subject is inferred is an inferred bound. Under the ladder ratified 2026-09-03 an
     EARLIER source corroborates and dates and never promotes, and a LATER one does not
     promote either, so `covers_scene_date` is `false` on all 27 rows.

  4. A REGISTER ROW CITES ITS MERGE RULE AND DOES NOT TRANSCRIBE IT, which is the one
     place this pass departs from T-1326 and it was measured rather than chosen. The voter
     crosswalk's rules are machine-written and uniform — "forenames agree initial for
     initial" — so carrying one verbatim onto a card carries a name agreement and nothing
     else. St Mary's merges are hand-written essays that corroborate the identification
     from OTHER evidence, and three of the nine name a relative: "his wife is Monique
     Nadeau in the register and the resident record documents his marriage". Copied onto
     the card, those sentences enter the residents corpus as stated kinship, and
     `tools/survey_stated_kin.py` read them exactly that way — three unruled kin
     statements appeared in the gate, about Chandler's daughter and Juneau's father, off a
     pass that is supposed to write a date. A citation carries the provenance without
     importing the claims: the row names the crosswalk, the register spelling and the
     resident name it was merged into, and the rule stays in the file that authored it.

  5. AND THE LADDER CUTS BOTH WAYS, WHICH THIS CORPUS IS THE FIRST TO NEED. Three of the
     thirteen register appearances are dated after 1 July 1835 (20 August, 25 September and
     9 November 1835). A later day cannot bound a presence AT the scene, so those rows
     carry `side_of_scene_date: "later"` and `here_by: null`, and say so. Only an earlier
     appearance gets an `here_by`.

NO GRADE MOVES, NO IDENTITY REOPENS, NO PERSON IS MINTED, AND NO OTHER KEY IS TOUCHED.
`--self-test` diffs a record through the applier and asserts the changed key set is
`{"appearance_bounds"}` alone. The block is its own key and not T-1326's: that pass's
`--check` re-derives `dated_bounds` byte for byte against the voter crosswalk, so a second
corpus written into the same list would fail a green gate belonging to a closed ticket.
