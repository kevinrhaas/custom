"""Re-derive the Washington-Madison tier's seven block-numeral crops from committed street lines.

T-1094, split out of T-1089, itself split out of T-0858. Wright writes a numeral
across the middle of every block of the Original Town. T-0788 read twenty-two of
them by cutting each crop from that block's OWN committed street lines — an
identification made by the georeference rather than by the reader's eye — and
T-1088 read the North Division's seven the same way once its streets landed.
Fifty-eight blocks less twenty-nine leaves the Original Town's southernmost tier,
between Washington Street and Madison Street, and this file cuts it.

WHAT MAKES IT CUTTABLE NOW, AND WHAT IS STILL WEAKER THAN THE NORTH DIVISION'S.
`data/streets/1835.json` holds Washington Street across the whole tier and, since
T-0877, Madison Street closing it on the south. The seven north-south lines that
flank the blocks — Market, Franklin, Wells, La Salle, Clark, Dearborn, State —
are committed and `attested`, but every one of them STOPS AT y = -400 m, ten
metres south of Washington and a hundred and thirty-four short of Madison. So
three of each box's four sides are a committed line and the fourth pair is those
same committed lines CONTINUED SOUTH ALONG THEIR OWN BEARING to the tier. That
continuation is a computation from committed endpoints, not a reading and not a
new street: nothing is written into data/streets/1835.json by this file, because
a line this project has no control for should not be published as one. It is
stated here so a reader can disagree with it, and the readings it frames are
graded `inferred` like every other numeral in the file.

THE RULE, stated once:

  east and west   the two flanking north-south centrelines, each continued south
                  along the bearing of its own committed two-point path until it
                  crosses Madison Street
  north           Washington Street's centreline, taken at whichever flank it
                  runs further south, so the box never reaches over the street
  south           Madison Street's centreline

Block 52 has no committed street on its west: its west edge is the South Branch.
Its box is therefore cut ONE MODULE west of Market Street, the module being the
mean spacing of the seven flanking lines at Madison (123.36 m — the same module
the North Division tier measured, to the centimetre). That is a wider box than
the block, and the numeral sits in its eastern sixth; the entry cites the tighter
region it was actually read on.

WHAT THIS FILE IS. It is the DERIVATION of the crop boxes, not the reading. The
reading — which numeral stands in which block — lives in
`data/traces/thompson_block_numbering.json` § blocks_not_in_the_grid, one entry
per block, each citing the IIIF region it was read on. This tool recomputes those
regions from the committed street lines, checks that each `read_at` window still
lies wholly inside the box it is cited under, and fails if either has drifted. It
authors no ground: `tools/generate_plat_lots.py` emits the three South Division
tiers between South Water and Washington and nothing south of Washington, so
there is no cell for these numbers to be stamped onto, and they wait in
`blocks_not_in_the_grid` with the North Division's seven.

    tools/read_washington_madison_numerals.py            print the derivation
    tools/read_washington_madison_numerals.py --check    fail if the committed crops
                                                         are not what this re-derives
