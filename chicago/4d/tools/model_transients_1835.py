"""THE TRANSIENT COHORT OF 1 JULY 1835: who was in the town that day and not of it.

T-1352, piece 1 of T-1178. The town model (T-1293) bounds the town's RESIDENTS and
says so in terms; the land-sale crowd, the immigrants waiting on lots, the harbour
gang and the crews ashore are a separate population that the order book (T-1166)
carries as one unapportioned row. This bounds that row and says where it slept.

    tools/model_transients_1835.py --build       write the model and its report
    tools/model_transients_1835.py --check       re-derive both and refuse any drift
    tools/model_transients_1835.py --self-test   the guards, fired on fixtures

WHAT THIS TOOL IS. An ADJUDICATION over committed claim records and committed derived
files. It opens no scan and no network, and it names, ages and houses nobody: what it
returns is a bracket, a composition and a list of sleeping places. It WRITES NO PERSON
— that is T-1353, and the standing constraint's own rule applies there and not here.

WHY THE COHORT IS NOT IN THE TOWN MODEL. Because a transient is not a resident and the
census that a resident model is built from does not count one. Chicago's own enumerator
drew that line himself: the census of 1 August 1843 prints `Transient persons` as a row
of its own, 533 against a permanent 7,047, and Norris's remarks on the same census say
he excluded every person not permanently residing in the city. Folding the two together
is exactly the error he says the 1835 figure of 5,500 made.

THE SCENE DATE CATCHES A FALLING TIDE, AND THAT IS THE FINDING. The federal land sale
at Chicago closed on 27 June 1835 — 232 of the register's 274 June entries fall on the
26th and the 27th — and the Democrat of 1 July, printed on the scene date itself, says
the sale 'has passed'. The crowd of 1 July is a draining sale crowd on top of a
navigation-season immigrant stream that was still landing: the Marine Journal has
vessels in with passengers on 28 and 29 June and again on 2 and 3 July. The two move in
opposite directions across the day and no committed source measures either, which is
why this model declines a point reading and says so rather than splitting the
difference and calling it an answer.
