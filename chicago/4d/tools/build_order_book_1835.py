"""THE 1835 RECONSTRUCTION ORDER BOOK: known minus model, resolved into work.

T-1166, which closes the 1835 TOWN ANALYSIS band. Every model above states a
TARGET (T-1293, folding T-1161..T-1165); the profile states what is KNOWN
(T-1160); the roster states which REAL NAMES are still on offer (T-1159). The
order book is the subtraction — and, because a subtraction nobody can spend is
just another number, it is the subtraction resolved into buckets, each with the
ticket that owns filling it and a counter that ticket writes back.

    tools/build_order_book_1835.py --build       write the book and its report
    tools/build_order_book_1835.py --check       re-derive both and refuse drift
    tools/build_order_book_1835.py --self-test   the guards, fired on fixtures

WHAT THIS TOOL IS.  An ADJUDICATION over files this repository already holds and
already gates, exactly as the town model is. It reads no page of any source,
opens no network, names nobody, ages nobody, houses nobody, and creates no
person, household, business or building. Every quantity it prints is a function
of a committed derived file, and the file is named beside the quantity.

WHAT A BUCKET IS.  A cell of the town, keyed by the axes the models bound:
persons by sex x age band x division x household type x trade, households by
type x division, businesses by class, structures by archetype group x division.
Each carries `target` (the model), `known_attested` / `known_inferred` (the
layer), `to_reconstruct` (the difference), the `owning_ticket` that must fill
it, and `filled` — the counter a filler increments through its own `--build`.

THE FOUR RULES THIS BOOK ADDS, AND WHY EACH IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN.

1. A POINT FROM A RANGE.  The town model answers in ranges on purpose, and a
   quota cannot be a range: a filler asked for "between 469 and 816 households"
   builds nothing. Where the model gives a `point` the book takes it; where it
   gives only `low` and `high` the book takes the MIDPOINT, rounds half up, and
   carries the range beside it so the reader can see the width of what was
   collapsed. The midpoint is a planning figure and never a claim about 1835.

2. THE UNRESOLVED KNOWN.  A named person the layer cannot place in a cell is
   still a person standing in the town, and a book that ignored them would order
   their replacement a second time. So the known who cannot be resolved onto an
   axis are subtracted PRO RATA across the cells of that axis, which is the only
   distribution that keeps the totals honest without asserting where anybody was.

3. PRESENCE IS THE TEST FOR "KNOWN", AND T-1386 IS WHERE PRESENCE IS READ.
   The first cut of this rule counted only a record whose own `present_on_scene_date`
   said `present`, and left the 820 `uncertain` ones to T-1172's re-admission as
   roster class R1: counting a household as known AND offering it on the roster
   would order one person twice.  T-1386 RE-ADMITTED THEM (2026-09-19).  827 people
   are ruled into the town on the owner's standing rule — an attested or inferred
   resident is in the population unless there is EVIDENCE they were not — and they
   stand in the layer today, which is why the landing card counts 2,267 people and
   this book counted 457.  So the double-count the rule was written to stop has
   INVERTED: leaving them out of `known` does not decline to order them twice, it
   orders a replacement for 826 people already standing (T-1463).
       The rule is therefore read against the rulings file as well as the index: a
   household is known when the index records it `present`, or when T-1386 rules it
   present.  The two `evidenced_absences` stay out, because evidence of absence is
   exactly what the rule asks for; and the roster stays a LICENCE rather than a
   quota (rule `real_names_first`), so counting these once orders nobody twice.
       THIS APPLIES A RULING RATHER THAN MAKING ONE.  A run that finds a new
   modelling decision required here is to stop and say so, not to invent it.

4. THE FORT IS NOT APPORTIONED.  The garrison of 1 July 1835 is a return to be
   read (T-1176), not a share of a town model, so the fort division's person and
   household targets are `null` and its bucket says which ticket bounds them.
   Whatever T-1176 returns is subtracted from the civilian quota at the next
   `--build`, which is why that ticket is named in the bucket rather than guessed at.

THE COUNTERS ARE CARRIED, NOT RE-DERIVED.  `filled` and the `fills` ledger are
written by the reconstruction tools, not by this one, so `--check` re-derives
every bucket from the inputs, carries the committed counters across unchanged,
and then REFUSES an overfilled bucket or a fill naming no ticket. That is what
makes the book a quota rather than a report: a filler that bypasses it is red.

    The book's first cut drew its employed persons out of the ADULT cells alone, on
    the reading that an occupation is an adult's. That is an assumption, and the 1840
    schedule cannot settle it: its seven industry columns count `persons in each
    family employed`, carry no sex and no age at all (composition_1840.json
    `industry.note`), and the extract holds them only as household totals. So the age
    floor of the trade cut has to come from somewhere, and the honest somewhere is
    the town's own record.

    This reads it: every person in the resident layer whose OCCUPATION is `attested`
    or `inferred` — read from a source rather than drawn by a reconstruction stage —
    counted by the book's own bands. A person the layer grades `reconstructed` is
    skipped by name: they exist only because a stage drew them against this book, and
    a cut calibrated on its own output is not a reading.

    It returns a participation FACTOR per band: the band's workers per unit of the
    1840 pyramid's population in that band, against the same rate among adults. Both
    halves come from the same instrument, so the survivorship that inflates a record
    of trades — the sources that print an occupation print proprietors and heads of
    household — inflates numerator and denominator alike and cancels to first order.
    That cancellation is the argument, and it is why the factor is a RELATIVE rate
    rather than the record's own 94.5% male, which is survivorship and nothing else.

    A band the record does not reach gets 0.0 and orders nobody. The floor is
    therefore measured on every build: if a later reading finds a working child, the
    band opens by itself; if the nine youths here were withdrawn, it shuts.

        confined to it: `tools/seat_lodgers_1835.py` reads a lodging bucket's whole
        `to_reconstruct` and ignores `filled` — deliberately, and its docstring says why —
        so moving one slot of a bucket it has drawn against re-derives its ENTIRE draw.

        Run on 2026-09-21 without this clause, the re-cut moved 35 slots out of the adult
        lodging cells and into the reopened 10_19 band. `seat_lodgers_1835.py --check`
        went red at once, and re-deriving it re-dealt 25 of its 56 invented boarders — the
        same count in the same 13 houses, nobody retired — after which SIX further gate
        steps failed, because `rc_cavanagh_johanna`, a boarder the stage had invented, is

        layer, seated by the employment join, and answered for by the employment coverage

        it is work somebody has spent, and the ruling of 2026-09-20 protects it.

# druggists, eight taverns, two breweries — and the register counts premises too, so the
# two sit in one unit and `target - known` is a quota. Two lines do not: "twenty-two
# lawyers" and "fourteen physicians" count PEOPLE, and T-1007's spend
# (`trade_census_1835_spend.json`) is the adjudication that says so and does the join —
# eighteen lawyer records are thirteen men, five of them second printings of one office,
# and three physician records are eight men once the resident cards carrying Egan, Harmon,
# Goodhue, Kimberly and Temple are read alongside them. Set the census's men against the
# register's NOTICES and the book orders four lawyers the town already has and eleven
# physicians it is nothing like short of.
#
# AND THE COUNT IS NOT OF THE SCENE. The census was returned between 1 September and
# December 1835 over a town of 3,297; the scene is 1 July 1835, and the town model brackets
# that day's population between 2,353 and 3,265. A class of men who serve a population
# scales with it, so the number practising on the scene date is bracketed by the same two
# ratios, and the book orders to the LOW END of that bracket and never above it: a
# reconstruction that filled to the December figure would put into the July town the
# practitioners who arrived in the three months after it.
#
# The bracket is stated on the bucket rather than folded into a number, and the low end is
# floored rather than rounded, because a fraction of a physician is a physician this town
# is not known to have had.

    THE FAILURE IT REMOVES. `ticket.mjs done` already prints a NOTE when a close
    leaves a split parent with no live child: "any research unit that defers to it by
    id is now stranded (T-1237). That fails the re-derivation, in a tool this PR does
    not run." This is that tool. Until now nothing re-derived the order book against
    the queue, so the note was advice a closing run could read and walk past, and by
    2026-09-21 thirteen of the twenty-four ids the book's owner tables named had
    closed or split under it — the west ground still waiting on T-1192 eight days
    after T-1192 became two tickets, which is what T-1420 was filed for.

    WHAT IS A WORK ORDER, AND WHAT IS NOT. A bucket's `owning_ticket`,
    `owning_tickets` and `ground_waits_on` say who MUST DO the work that is left.
    They are the only forward-looking ticket ids in this book, and a forward-looking
    id naming a ticket nobody can claim is a hole. Everything else the book stamps
    with a ticket is BACKWARD-looking and must never move: `fills[].ticket` is who
    actually filled a bucket, `recut_refusals` and `programme_deltas` record who made
    a ruling, `roster_offered.tickets` records who a licence was offered to, and the
    book's own `ticket` is who wrote it. Those are provenance, and rewriting
    provenance to keep a gate quiet would be the worse defect by far.

    AND ONLY WHERE THERE IS WORK LEFT. A bucket the town has already filled keeps the
    id of the ticket that filled it, because that is the same fact `fills` carries and
    there is nothing left to order. So the gate fires exactly when a run is told to do
    something by a ticket that no longer exists — which is also why it stays quiet
    through the ordinary close, where a ticket ends by discharging its own buckets.

    carry a `blocked_on`, and unblock; `done`, `split` and `withdrawn` name nobody.
