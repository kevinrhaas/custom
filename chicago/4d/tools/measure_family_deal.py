"""Can a parcel generator build every family it is allowed to deal? (T-0142, T-0172)

WHY THIS EXISTS. A parcel generator does not choose its families: the 665-roof
schedule and the parcel recipes do, and an entry names one. So a family is either
buildable at EVERY size its band lets it be dealt at, or the schedule is holding a card
that kills the run whenever it comes up — and it comes up rarely enough that the
standing records look fine. That is exactly what happened to H2. `blk_randolph_dearborn`'s
second deal asked for a merchant house, the family's authored eave band runs 18-21 ft,
`frame_dwelling` refuses a two-storey wall over 6.2 m because the one attested ceiling in
this dataset is the Green Tree's seven and a half feet, and the sample landed at 6.234 m.
Two H2s were already standing, both under the limit by luck, so nothing in the repo said
the family was broken.

Standing records cannot answer that question — there are two H1s and two H2s in the
whole platted-block parcel. So this deals each family several hundred synthetic
instances through the generator's OWN sampling and form rules, and asks two things of
each:

  1. the archetype the family resolves through will BUILD it — `from_phase` is the same
     call the generator makes before it writes a record; and
  2. every value that cites the family's band is INSIDE that band — the same reading
     `tools/measure_band_claims.py` takes of the records that landed, taken here of the
     records that could.

It builds no geometry and needs no Blender: `from_phase` validates, which is the step
that refuses. Roughly a few seconds for the whole table.

## FOUR PARCELS, NOT ONE (T-0172)

T-0142 built this against `generate_block_infill.py` alone and said so; the other three
anonymous parcels deal the same families through the same archetypes and were never
asked the question. They are here now. What they do NOT share is an interface — each
generator authors its form through a differently-shaped call, and the parcel adapters
below are that difference and nothing else. Each adapter answers three things: which
(family, archetype) pairs the parcel may deal, how it sizes a deal, and how it authors
the form.

Where a parcel authors its footprint in a hand-written recipe rather than sampling
(`west`, `household`), the sweep sizes deals from the family band anyway, because that
is the bound the parcel's OWN footprint note claims — *"a rectangle assigned by the
reconstruction recipe within the {family} family band"*. Sweeping only the sizes the
recipe happens to hold today would re-measure what already stands, which
`tools/measure_band_claims.py` does; the question here is what the recipe may deal.

## WHAT IS GATED, AND WHAT IS ONLY REPORTED

`check.sh` runs `--gate`, which is a **ratchet** against `tools/family_deal_baseline.json`:
a new refusal, or a new off-band family, is a failure; the committed ones are named
there with the reason each stands. The block parcel is green and gated absolutely — no
baseline entry may ever be added for it. The three parcels T-0172 brought in are not,
and the baseline says per family why not; the fault may shrink and may not grow.

    tools/measure_family_deal.py                the report, all four parcels
    tools/measure_family_deal.py --parcel west  one parcel
    tools/measure_family_deal.py --gate         exit 1 on a deal outside the baseline
    tools/measure_family_deal.py --strict       exit 1 on ANY refusal, baseline ignored
    tools/measure_family_deal.py --write-baseline   re-cut the census (shrink only)
