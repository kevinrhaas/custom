"""Compile data/businesses/ — one record per business, with a tier on every field.

    tools/compile_businesses.py --build       rewrite the compiled records
    tools/compile_businesses.py --check       the gate
    tools/compile_businesses.py --self-test   the gate's assertions still fire
    tools/compile_businesses.py --community-report   the shares of docs/RESEARCH/business_community_1835.md

T-1310, of T-1180. THERE WAS NOWHERE TO WRITE A BUSINESS DOWN. The business layer was
three DERIVED files — the newspaper claims, gazetteer.json, register_1835.json — and a
business existed in the scene only as a structure whose `function`/`occupants` block
named it. The register row has no staff field, no tier, no `sources[]`, and no dates
beyond the first and last issue a notice ran; a person's `works_at` is a bare structure
id. The owner's ask — a complete list of attested, inferred and then reconstructed
businesses, with the staff of each as part of their proprietors' resident profiles —
had no place to land. This builds the place. IT RECONSTRUCTS NOTHING: every one of the
196 records below is the register's own reading, restated with its tier made explicit
and its limits made queryable.

DERIVED, NEVER AUTHORED, for the same reason the gazetteer and the register are. A
`compiled_from_register` record is rewritten whole by `--build` and `--check` refuses a
committed copy a rebuild would not produce, so a hand edit to a compiled record is a
red gate rather than a silent divergence. A record a human means to author goes in
data/businesses/authored/ — which `--build` reads, validates and carries into the index
untouched. That directory is where T-1182's inferred-by-audit firms and T-1184's
reconstructions will be written; it is empty today, and the compiler is built to find
it empty without complaining.

THE ID SCHEME, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE ONE T-1180 NAMED. T-1180 asks for
`biz_<surname>_<trade>`. Derived over the 196 that scheme collides 27 times — five
houses land on `biz_montgomery_other`, four on `biz_wentworth_tavern`, two on
`biz_calhoun_printing_office` — and each collision is the same question: are these two
printed notices one house or two? That is an identity ruling, it is T-1182's to make
with the sources in front of it, and a compiler that settled it by appending `_2` would
be publishing an adjudication nobody made. So a compiled record takes the register's
own id with its `business_` prefix replaced by `biz_`: 1:1 with the printed notice it
comes from, collision-free by construction, and reversible, with `register_id` on the
record saying so out loud. `biz_<surname>_<trade>` and `rcb_…` stay in the schema for
the records a human authors, where the identity question has an author to answer it.

WHAT A TIER MEANS HERE. The ladder is the resident layer's, unchanged — attested,
inferred, reconstructed. A printed name is attested. The LINK from that printed name to
a town card is a separate claim from the name itself, and it is the register's: where
the register matched the name to a card, `person_id` carries the card and the basis
says which action made the match; where it did not, `person_id` is null and the basis
says the town does not hold that person yet. A null there is a finding, not a gap to be
filled by guessing.

THE LIMITS ARE DATA NOW. 61 of the register's businesses are `street_only` and 62 are
`unplaceable` at the scene date: the paper gives a street and no house, or no anchor at
all. Those are not missing locations — they are locations whose resolution the evidence
stops short of, and they were carried in prose in an `action_note` where nothing could
count them. Each is a `locations[]` entry with a `kind` that names the limit and a
`limit_reason` that quotes the register's reason, so "how many of the town's businesses
can we actually place?" is a query rather than a re-reading.

    # A HOUSE THAT MOVED (T-1402, of T-1182, audited with the sources in front of it).
    # Four of the register's businesses print one anchor and later another. The siting the
    # register did NOT make live is a real dated location and is kept as one, unplaced: it
    # is prose the register never resolved to an id, so the record says where the paper put
    # it and says that it could not be resolved.
    #
    # WHAT THE REGISTER'S TWO DATES ARE, because reading them the other way was the defect
    # this ticket found. A `changes` row brackets the MOVE: `after` is the last issue that
    # sets the old anchor and `before` is the first that sets the new one, so the address
    # changed somewhere in between and the corpus can say no more than that. The pair is
    # NOT the span of either siting — and it was being written onto the secondary row as
    # `from: after, to: before`, which dated the superseded address to exactly the window
    # in which it was being superseded, and carried it up to and including the first
    # printing of its replacement. Giles Spring's office read "Franklin and South Water,
    # 1834-11-26 to 1835-05-20" when 1834-11-26 is the LAST printing of that address and
    # 1835-05-20 the first of the Tremont House one.
    #
    # So each siting is dated by its own printings: the earlier one runs from the record's
    # first issue to `after`, the later one from `before` and is not closed.
    #
    # AND WHICH SIDE IS WHICH IS THE REGISTER'S RULING, NOT AN ASSUMPTION. `live_anchor`
    # names the anchor the register made the scene-date siting, by its own rule (the last
    # anchor first printed on or before the scene date). Usually that is the change's `to`
    # and the secondary row is the earlier siting. For business_the_chicago_democrat it is
    # the change's `from`: the move to Jones & King's is first printed 1835-08-05, after
    # the scene date, so the corner stays live and the LATER siting is the secondary row.
    # Reading every change as "earlier" put the corner on that record twice — once live,
    # once as its own predecessor — and left the move to Jones & King's nowhere on it.

    # THE COMMITTED COPY IS A DERIVATION, and --check must say so when it is edited.
    #
    # THE COMMENT HERE USED TO SAY "broken in a temporary copy of the tree so the
    # working tree is never touched", AND THAT IS NOT WHAT IT DID (T-1336). The temp
    # copy was the BACKUP; the hand-edit went into the live data/businesses/ record and
    # was copied back in a `finally`. Serially that is invisible. Under check.sh's job
    # pool it is not: the step declared immediately above this one re-derives that same
    # directory, the pool runs the two together, and it reads the edit this fixture is
    # holding. Observed — a branch went red on
    # `biz_a_chicago_stove_and_hollow_ware_dealer_august_1835.json`, which is
    # `sorted(...)[0]`, this fixture's own victim, and `--check` was green on the same
    # tree run alone.
    #
    # So the COPY is now the thing that is edited. `check()` reads the module-level
    # BUSINESSES, and a self-test runs in its own process, so rebinding it is enough:
    # this process checks the copy while every other process still sees the committed
    # records. The `finally` puts the binding back, not the bytes — no byte of the live
    # directory is written any more.
