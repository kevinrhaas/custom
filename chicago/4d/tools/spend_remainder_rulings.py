"""The written ruling on the 1,094 remaining unasserted units (T-1298).

    python3 tools/spend_remainder_rulings.py             write the five ruling registers
    python3 tools/spend_remainder_rulings.py --check     they re-derive; nothing drifted
    python3 tools/spend_remainder_rulings.py --self-test the rules below, held over the
                                                         corpus they derive

WHY THIS EXISTS. T-1234 gave the research-spend ledger a place to write a ruling down:
`data/research/spend_rulings.json`, consulted only where a reading's own dispositions run
out, a named rule with a stated reason and a note on every single unit it closes. That
file is HAND-AUTHORED and holds 87 rulings; T-1296 wrote the first DERIVED register, for
1,572 land-sale rows, because typing 1,572 notes by hand would make a worse register --
the notes drift and nobody can prove a note matched the row it claims to rule.

T-1298 is the remainder of T-1236, and it is five corpora at once:

    residents        382  the reserved people of the pilot and passes 02-15 whose pass
                          finding names no exact structured resident field
    newspapers       378  the person, notice, event, shipping and price units of the
                          thirteen held issues that no card names
    church           272  the register entries outside the later-only and outside-Chicago
                          rulings already carried by the readings themselves
    books             61  the non-person readings -- ground, harbour, weather, price,
                          shipping, institution and household
    genealogytrails    1  one landscape reading

Each gets its own derived register beside its corpus, on the terms
`research_spend_ledger.ruling_registers` sets: the same statement floor, the same note
floor, the same coverage faults. Every note is built out of the unit's OWN committed
fields -- its file's preamble, its pass finding's summary, its issue date, its register
role, its `normalized` line -- so a reader can put the note beside the row and see that
it says what the row says.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. Nothing here edits a resident, mints a person, moves a confidence,
invents a citation or re-adjudicates an identity. A hand-off is not a spend: it names the
OPEN ticket whose field genuinely owns the finding, and that ticket closing turns this
file red, which is the point. In particular this file does NOT decide the letter-list
question: T-0660 -> T-0691 is blocked on the owner and its outcome is not invented here.
A letter-list name is handed to T-1159, whose field is the roster of names the research
READ AND WITHHELD, with `letter-list-only` as a declared re-admission class -- recording
that a name was read and withheld is not ruling on whether its bearer lived here.

THE CORPUS IS DERIVED FROM THE CORPUS, not from the committed ledger: this tool asks
`research_spend_ledger.natural_disposition` -- the derivation that reads no ruling
register at all -- which units end unresolved and owned by T-1298, and rules exactly
those. So writing the registers cannot change what the registers are asked to cover, and
`--check` re-derives the same answer from the same readings.

    # ---- T-1337: THE REGISTER APPEARANCES THE CROSSWALKS DID NOT IDENTIFY ------------
    #
    # 95 register units reached the rule above as one undifferentiated hand-off, and 13 of
    # them had an identification standing in
    # `data/research/church/st_marys_baptisms_crosswalk.json` the whole time. T-1337 wrote
    # those 13 onto their cards, so they close `asserted` and never reach a register again
    # (`mine()` drops them, and `research_spend_ledger.ruling_coverage_faults` would fail a
    # ruling on one).
    #
    # The other 82 are the point of these four rules. The ticket's own instruction was
    # that where an identification CANNOT be made the answer is a refusal in writing and
    # not a fourth deferral -- and in every one of the 82 cases the refusal has already
    # been made, by name, in the crosswalk that looked. So each rule below states one
    # crosswalk outcome and the per-unit note carries that crosswalk's own words. Four
    # rules and not one, because the four grounds are genuinely different and a single
    # statement would have to be vague enough to be true of all of them -- the same
    # argument T-1301 made when it turned one enrichment rule into seven.
    #
    # NOTHING HERE MINTS, REGRADES OR REOPENS. A refusal is a complete answer, and each
    # rule says what would reopen it.

# T-1301: WHERE EACH ENRICHMENT GOES, ONE AT A TIME.
#
# T-1298 ruled all 98 `corroborated_enrichment` units under ONE rule whose `ticket` was
# T-1160, and T-1160 then closed. `research_spend_ledger` holds that a unit may only
# defer to work that is still going to happen, so the gate went red on all 98 at once --
# not on the work, on the pointer. T-1301 is the piece that owes them an answer.
#
# A blanket repoint of all 98 to one id is the thing to avoid: a rule takes a SINGLE
# ticket, and these enrichments name six different fields, so one id would hand five of
# them to a ticket whose acceptance does not mention them -- which is how a unit ends up
# deferring to work that is not going to happen a second time. So the one rule becomes
# SEVEN, each naming the open ticket whose acceptance owns the kind of fact it carries,
# and the table below records the adjudication for every unit BY HAND: the field the
# pass's own summary names, in a phrase a reader can put beside the summary. The note is
# still derived -- it prints the finding verbatim -- and only the routing is authored.
#
# T-1254 was the sixth destination the ticket named and it is `done`; nothing routes to
# it. Seven units are not handed on at all: their own summaries say the source is a
# volume or a return PRINTED AFTER 1 July 1835 which confirms and dates a person the town
# already holds and backfills no in-window value. Under the ladder ratified 2026-09-03
# that is `later_only` -- a terminal disposition the registers already use -- and calling
# it a deferral to an 1835 attribute-fill ticket would be the false half of the pair.
#
# NOTHING HERE WRITES A CARD. A hand-off is not a spend; it names the field and the open
# ticket that owns it, and that ticket closing turns this file red, which is the point.
