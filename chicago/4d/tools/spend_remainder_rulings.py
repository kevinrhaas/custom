"""The written ruling on the 1,094 remaining unasserted units (T-1298).

    python3 tools/spend_remainder_rulings.py             write the five ruling registers
    python3 tools/spend_remainder_rulings.py --check     they re-derive; nothing drifted
    python3 tools/spend_remainder_rulings.py --self-test the rules below, held over the
                                                         corpus they derive

WHY THIS EXISTS. T-1234 gave the research-spend ledger a place to write a ruling down:
`data/research/spend_rulings.json`, consulted only where a reading's own dispositions run
out, a named rule with a stated reason and a note on every single unit it closes. That
file is HAND-AUTHORED and holds 87 rulings; T-1296 wrote the first DERIVED register, for
1,572 land-sale rows, because typing 1,572 notes by hand would make a worse register --
the notes drift and nobody can prove a note matched the row it claims to rule.

T-1298 is the remainder of T-1236, and it is five corpora at once:

    residents        382  the reserved people of the pilot and passes 02-15 whose pass
                          finding names no exact structured resident field
    newspapers       378  the person, notice, event, shipping and price units of the
                          thirteen held issues that no card names
    church           272  the register entries outside the later-only and outside-Chicago
                          rulings already carried by the readings themselves
    books             61  the non-person readings -- ground, harbour, weather, price,
                          shipping, institution and household
    genealogytrails    1  one landscape reading

Each gets its own derived register beside its corpus, on the terms
`research_spend_ledger.ruling_registers` sets: the same statement floor, the same note
floor, the same coverage faults. Every note is built out of the unit's OWN committed
fields -- its file's preamble, its pass finding's summary, its issue date, its register
role, its `normalized` line -- so a reader can put the note beside the row and see that
it says what the row says.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. Nothing here edits a resident, mints a person, moves a confidence,
invents a citation or re-adjudicates an identity. A hand-off is not a spend: it names the
OPEN ticket whose field genuinely owns the finding, and that ticket closing turns this
file red, which is the point. In particular this file does NOT decide the letter-list
question: T-0660 -> T-0691 is blocked on the owner and its outcome is not invented here.
A letter-list name is handed to T-1159, whose field is the roster of names the research
READ AND WITHHELD, with `letter-list-only` as a declared re-admission class -- recording
that a name was read and withheld is not ruling on whether its bearer lived here.

THE CORPUS IS DERIVED FROM THE CORPUS, not from the committed ledger: this tool asks
`research_spend_ledger.natural_disposition` -- the derivation that reads no ruling
register at all -- which units end unresolved and owned by T-1298, and rules exactly
those. So writing the registers cannot change what the registers are asked to cover, and
`--check` re-derives the same answer from the same readings.
