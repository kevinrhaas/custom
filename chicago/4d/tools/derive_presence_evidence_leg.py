"""The dated evidence leg under every uncertain presence, as a field (T-1144, acc. 9).

    python3 tools/derive_presence_evidence_leg.py --write      write the legs
    python3 tools/derive_presence_evidence_leg.py --check      re-derive and diff
    python3 tools/derive_presence_evidence_leg.py --report     the legs, counted

WHY THE FIELD EXISTS. 820 households stand `present_on_scene_date: uncertain` — the
layer holds the person and no source follows them to 1 July 1835. That verdict is a
finding rather than a gap, and the thing that makes it a finding is a DATE: the last
day the corpus can still see this person. T-1159 classifies those presences by that
date and T-1172 re-admits them against it, so the date is load-bearing for two
tickets — and until now it lived only in the prose of the presence note, where
`tools/export_borderline_roster.py` reached for it with a regular expression. A second
representation of the same fact is the thing that drifts, and a regex over prose is
the weakest representation there is: it read `1835-05-20` out of one note and nothing
at all out of the 780 whose note names no date, falling back to the arrival bound.

So the leg is derived HERE, from the card's own structured evidence, written onto the
card, and read from there by everybody. T-1144 acceptance 9 asks for exactly that.

WHAT THE RULE IS, AND WHERE IT REFUSES TO GUESS.

Every candidate comes from a block the card already carries, never from prose:

    press_evidence · civic_evidence · book_evidence · church_evidence ·
    census_evidence · profile_facts      → `describes_date`, with `locator`,
                                           `record_id` and `source` beside it
    persons[].letter_list_returns[]      → the returns the post office printed,
                                           used only for a date no block carries
    persons[].roles[]                    → `from`/`to`, which is the SOURCE's span
    arrival.value (`not_later_than`)     → a bound on arrival, not an appearance

Those four are TIERS, in that order, and the first tier with a candidate wins outright:

  1. `sighting` — a dated reading of this person in a record. The strongest thing the
     card holds, and the only kind that is an APPEARANCE.
  2. `source_span` — a role dated by what its sources are about. The role's own note
     says the bound is the source's and not the man's, so a span may not outrank a
     sighting even when it reaches further: a printing that covers 1833-11 to 1835-08
     is not a sighting in August.
  3. `arrival_bound` — the card holds one date and it is a bound on when the person
     was already here. It is carried as the leg because it is the only date there is,
     and `leg` says which kind it is so no reader can mistake it for a sighting.

Within the winning tier the candidate with the greatest `reaches` (the latest day its
reading can mean) wins; ties go to the narrower precision, then to the family order
above, then to the record id — deterministic, and none of it depends on dict order.

A candidate whose EARLIEST possible day falls after 1 July 1835 is not admitted at
all: an 1843 directory entry is a later appearance, which is T-1159's class R5 and not
this field's business. When that is all a card holds, the leg is `null` and the note
says a later record names this person and names its date.

WHAT IS NOT WRITTEN. A household whose presence is not `uncertain` carries no leg, and
one that stops being uncertain loses it — the field is the evidence under a verdict,
so it may not outlive the verdict. `--check` holds both halves.
