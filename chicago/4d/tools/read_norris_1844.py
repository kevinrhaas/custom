"""Norris's *General Directory and Business Advertiser of the City of Chicago for
the Year 1844* — the directory proper, read entry by entry (T-0555).

`--build` reads the committed page text under
`data/research/directories/text/norris_1844_leaf_*.txt` and writes
`data/research/directories/claims/norris_1844_directory_entries.json`.
`--check` rebuilds in memory and compares, so a hand-edit of the generated file
is caught the way `read_voter_lists.py` catches one.

THE STRUCTURE IS THE INDENT. Norris sets every entry flush left and turns the
long ones in about half an inch. The committed text keeps that: a turned line
carries two leading spaces, taken off the word coordinates of the scan, so the
entry boundaries survive the trip from image to text and can be checked by eye.

1844 IS NINE YEARS LATE. Nothing here is an 1835 fact. Every claim carries
`describes_date: "1844"`, and the crosswalk is the only place a name in this
volume is allowed to touch a person in the 1835 scene.

# Norris's own abbreviations, printed in his preface: h for house, r for residence,
# b for between. Two things had to be said about them that were not (T-0987 stretch 5):
#
#   `(?<!-)` — the compositor's HYPHEN is not a word boundary this rule may cut at.
#   `\b` holds on the far side of one, so `boarding-house` read as a trade ending in
#   a hyphen and an address beginning "house …".
#
#   THE SINGLE LETTERS ARE LOWER CASE AND A MAN'S INITIAL IS NOT. The whole pattern
#   was compiled `re.I`, so `h`, `r` and `b` matched the capital initials this volume
#   sets everywhere — and the address began at the first of them. `Adams, R. E. W,
#   physician, corner of Clark and Lake streets` cut at the `R.` of the man's own
#   name and left him no trade at all and an address of "E. W, physician, corner of
#   Clark and Lake streets"; `Beer, Adam, shoemaker, at J. B. Mitchell's` cut at the
#   `B.` of his employer and read a trade of "shoemaker, at J". 271 of the 2,073
#   entries were cut at an initial. The abbreviation WORDS stay case-blind (`res`,
#   `Res`); the three single letters do not.
PLACE = re.compile(r"\b(?<!-)(?:(?i:house|residence|res|boards|bds)|[hrb])\.?\s")

# …AND `House` IS ALSO THE NAME OF A BUILDING, WHICH THIS RULE CANNOT SEE (T-1021,
# found in passing and named here so the next run does not rediscover it). The word
# is matched case-blind, so a capitalised `House` standing inside a hotel's proper
# name opens the address at the wrong word. It is four entries, all of them printed:
#
#     n1844_e0402  Cook, Geo. barkeeper, at American Temperance House res same
#     n1844_e0849  Hisiley, Geo. House of Entertainment, S. Water st.'near Lasalle st
#     n1844_e1629  Skinner & Smith, Mansion House. 6G Lake street
#     n1844_e1764  Thomas & Wheelock, Washington Coffee House, Tremont House
#
# Norris prints his abbreviation lower case — `house Adams st.` — which is the same
# tell the single letters already use, so the repair is narrow. It is a separate
# ruling about the PLACE rule and is not made here.

# …AND THE SUPERSEDED PATTERN IS KEPT SO THE RULE CAN BE RE-MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED
# (T-1022). The case rule above landed inside another ticket's stretch and was never
# priced, so the count that mattered — how many entries' READING it moves — was
# carried as a guess. `--self-test` now re-reads the whole volume through this
# pattern and prices it against the committed one, which is the only form of the
# claim that cannot go stale:
#
#   294  entries print an upper-case `H.`, `R.` or `B.` token at all
#   275  of them have that capital as the FIRST place-shaped token in the line —
#        usually inside the NAME, which the split never cuts at, so the reading stands
#    95  entries have their occupation or address actually MOVE, and all 95 are the
#        defect exactly: under the case-blind pattern each one's address began at a
#        one-letter initial. There is no other reason an entry moves, which is what
#        makes every one of the 95 a repair rather than a trade.
#
# Downstream, `crosswalk_norris_1844.py` carries `could_carry_address` 82 → 81. The
# single match that stopped carrying one is Joseph Bradley (n1844_e0186, `clerk, at
# W. H. Adams & Co.'s`), whose case-blind "address" was `H. Adams & Co.'s` — the tail
# of his employer's firm and never a place. The lost match is a false one; nothing a
# resident could stand on was given up. `could_carry_occupation` holds at 59 and
# every other crosswalk count is unchanged.

# THE STREET NORRIS PRINTS WITH NO PLACE-ABBREVIATION BEFORE IT (T-1113).
#
# `PLACE` cuts a trade from an address at Norris's own `h`/`res`/`b`. Where he sets
# none there is nothing to cut at, and the whole tail stays in `occupation` — 304 of
# the 2,073 entries name a street that way, because a shop's address IS its trade line
# ("grocer, 175 Lake st"). That volume-scale question is not this rule and is filed
# separately; what is repaired here is the entry where the street reached the NAME.
#
# The forename walk takes a capitalised token while it has fewer than three, so a
# street set straight after the surname is read as a third forename and the trade then
# begins at the bare word `st`:
#
#     Brown, S. B. Ohio st. b Cass and Rush sts   →  given "S. B. Ohio", trade "st"
#     Intelligence Office, Clark st. opposite …   →  given "Clark",     trade "st. …"

# THE TEST IS THE WORD THAT FOLLOWS, NOT A LIST OF STREETS. A capitalised token with a

# that a `st`, `street` or `avenue` follows. Holding a gazetteer here would fail on the
# scanner's spellings (`Wash.`, `Frank.`, `Lasatte`) and would have to be kept in step
# with the street layer; the designator is set by the same compositor as the street and
# travels with it. A ONE-LETTER token is exempt: `Geo. W. Water street` sets an initial
# before the street, and `W.` is as likely the man's as the street's West — see the
# residual noted with n1844_e0807 below.

# WHAT IT COSTS DOWNSTREAM, MEASURED (T-1113). `consolidate_resident_evidence.py`
# gathers an identity on surname plus forenames, so a street inside the forename minted
# a person: `id_brown_s_b_ohio` stood beside the Simon B. Brown whom Fergus 1843 puts
# on Ohio between Cass and Rush — the same street the phantom was named for. Five such
# identities fold into the person they were always part of (Brown, Cady, Chapman, Ellis,
# Hart, and the Intelligence Office into the 1843 intelligence office at 38 Clark), and
# `n1844_e0677` becomes an R1 refusal, because `Galvin, Mrs.` names no forename once the
# street is off it. identities 6,817 → 6,812, appearances 10,546 → 10,545. The 1844
# crosswalk is unmoved — none of these twelve entries reaches an 1835 resident, and
# `could_carry_address` holds at 81.

# THE RESIDUAL, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN (n1844_e0807). `Hart, Geo. W. Water street,
# house Wabash st` reads a forename of "Geo. W" and a trade line beginning "Water
# street", and the `W.` may belong to either side: George W. Hart, or the West Water
# street this volume names a dozen times. Both hands print it the same, so no reading
# settles it. The rule leaves the initial with the man because that is where the walk
# already had it; what it fixes there is the street inside the name, not the initial.


# THE STREET THAT IS THE FIRM'S AND NOT THE MAN'S — REFUSED, WITH THE REASON (T-1113).
#
# Five entries print a street after `of <firm>` or `at <employer>'s` and no place
# abbreviation anywhere. Reading that street into `address` would be the easy repair
# and a false one: `of B. & Sherman, Dearborn street` is where the PARTNERSHIP stands,
# not where David Ballentine sleeps, and this project's `address` is a residence —
# Norris marks one with `h`, `res` or `b` and marks none of these. A business street
# landed on a resident's card as a home is a provenance defect that no downstream
# reader could see, so all five stay refused and say why here and on the claim.
#
# THE SIXTH OF THEM IS THE PRINTED LINE RUNNING OUT. `Magie, H. H. of H. H. M. & Co.
# house` ends AT the abbreviation with no street after it. The ticket expected that to
# need a page-image read; it does not. The second hand typed the same line from a
# different copy of the printed book and ends at the same word — the comparison scores
# the pair identical, ratio 1.0 — so the shortfall is the printed page's, not this
# scan's, and there is no street on the page to go and read.

# FIRM OR PERSON IS DECIDED ON THE LEADING TOKENS, NOT ON THE FIRST COMMA (T-1013).
#
# The first version of this test read `FIRM` against the text before the first
# comma. That catches the style with no comma in it — `Sicar & Co. groceries and
# boarding house` — and misses the INVERTED style this volume uses constantly,
# where the surname is set first so the firm files under its alphabet:
#
#     Jones, B. & Co. dry goods and groceries, S. Water, b Clark and Dearborn
#
# Before the comma stands `Jones`, so thirty entries of that shape were read as
# people, and the firm filter in `crosswalk_norris_1844.py` — which exists so a
# company is never matched to a resident of 1835 — never saw them.
#
# THE RULE IS NOT "THE LINE CONTAINS `& Co.`". 124 entries carry that string and
# most of them are people: `Bradley, Joseph, clerk, at W. H. Adams & Co.'s` is a
# clerk naming his employer, and `Burley, A. G. of A. G. B. & Co.` is a partner
# giving his residence. What separates them is WHERE the marker stands. Norris
# sets the name first and the trade after it, so walk the leading tokens and stop
# at the first plain lower-case word (the trade has started) or at `of` (the
# partnership preposition, which can only follow a man's own name). A firm marker
# inside that prefix is a firm; the same marker after it belongs to somebody
# else's firm.

# The prefix is also the firm's NAME, so the two readings cannot disagree.

# THE SCANNER'S AMPERSAND, AND THE SEVEN FIRMS THAT READ AS MEN (T-1021).
#
# `FIRM` needs a real `&`. archive.org sets this volume's ampersand as `<fc`, `6c`
# or `it` in seven entries, so the test never fires and each reads as a man whose
# surname is the whole partnership — seven Lake, Water and Clark street TRADES,
# with printed addresses, filed under a name no compositor set:
#
#     Ballentine <fc Sherman, dry goods and groceries, 122 Lake street
#     Bowen 6c Cole, dry goods and groceries, 66 Lake street
#     Bracken it Tuller, dry goods and groceries, 161 Lake st
#     Crauer <fc Sanser, builders, Clark st. b Randolph and Michigan sts
#     Gould it Dodge, ball alley and grocery, South Water st. b State and Dearborn
#     Hamilton <fc White, dry goods and grocery store, 139 Lake st
#     Skinner 6c .Smith, Mansion House. 6G Lake street
#
# T-1018 REFUSED them rather than damage them — capping the comma-derived name at
# the prefix would have truncated `Bowen 6c Cole` to `Bowen` and minted a man who
# is not in the book — and left the ruling to this ticket. Here it is made.
#
# THE RULING IS THE BOOK'S OWN, NOT THIS TOOL'S GUESS. Norris prints every one of
# the seven partnerships a SECOND time, in a partner's own entry or a clerk's, and
# on those lines the scanner set the ampersand correctly:
#
#     n1844_e0062  Ballentine, David, of B. & Sherman, Dearborn street bet Kinzie…
#     n1844_e0167  Bowen, Erastus, of B. & Cole, house Michigan avenue
#     n1844_e0179  Bracken, John, of Bracken & Tuller, res Wabash avenue
#     n1844_e1555  Sanser, John W. of Cruver & S. house cor Clark and Michigan sts
#     n1844_e0507  Dodge, Martin, of Gould & Dodge, res N. Gould's
#     n1844_e0783  Hamilton, Robert P. of H. & White, res T. E. Hamilton's
#     n1844_e1654  Smith, J. F. of Skinner & S., Mansion House
#
# So the question each row answers is not "is this a firm" — the volume says it is,
# twice — but "which character did the compositor set", and the second hand (Kim
# Torp's transcription, cited by file and line) answers that off the printed page.
# Where SHE disagrees with this reading she is quoted in `second_hand_disagrees`
# and nothing here is moved to match her: Crauer/Cruver is a SURNAME disagreement
# this repair does not touch, and it stands unresolved.
#
# THE TRAP, AND WHY THIS IS A TABLE. `it` is an English word and `6c` is how this
# scanner sets `&c.` — `Surdam. S. J. stoves, &c. 132 Lake st`. A rule loose enough
# to read those three tokens as ampersands wherever they stand would weld `stoves
# it` into a partnership, so this is a table of NAMED SPANS, exactly as WELDED_OF
# above is a table and not a wider OF_STOP. It touches seven entries and can touch
# no eighth, which `--self-test` asserts from both ends: each span matches exactly
# one entry, and any entry the `Name <conj> Name` SHAPE still reaches with no row
# here stays a T-1018 refusal and fails the OVERRUN_CLASSES ratchet.
#
# The reading moves and the quote keeps the damage, the standing convention. One
# row lifts a second character with the ampersand and says so.

#   a PERSON naming somebody else's firm      `Parker, John, of P. 6c Dpdge, ho Dearborn`
#   `&c.` closing a stock list                `hardware, iron, nails, &c. 128 Lake st`
#   the scanner's `at`, set as `;it`          `cabinet maker ;it J. B. Weir's`
#   a firm already read as one, on `& Co.`    `Wheeler, Wm. & Co. hardwaid, &c. 145 Lake st`
#
# A rule that read those tokens as ampersands wherever they stood would take all
# twenty-one — welding `nails &c` and `maker ;it` into partnerships. The table above
# cannot reach them, because it matches a whole span at the head of an entry, and this
# asserts it: by id, by the printed line, and by what each must READ as. Three of them
# are firms and stay firms; the other eighteen are men and stay men. A re-read that
# moves one fails here rather than silently widening what the repair touches.
#
# The value is (firm, as printed).

# THE FIRST COMMA IS NOT ALWAYS NORRIS'S NAME COMMA (T-1018).
#
# `split_entry` takes a person's name as everything before the first comma, which is
# how Norris set it — `Crissman, John M. laborer`. archive.org's OCR loses that comma
# constantly, setting a full stop or nothing at all, and then the name runs on into
# whatever follows: `Wells. Andrew S. of Johoimett W. & Co. h Rand st. b Lasalle and
# Wells` read as a surname of thirteen words, with the trade and the street lost
# inside it.
#
# `name_prefix()` (T-1013) already knows where a name ends — it walks the leading
# tokens and stops at the trade or at `of` — so the repair is to CAP the comma-derived
# name at that prefix. 69 entries read past it. The cap is right for 46 of them and
# would do damage in the other 23, so each of those four classes is refused by name
# and the refusal is written onto the claim.
#
#   firm_branch (7)    The entry is a firm, and the firm branch below never uses the
#                      comma at all — it takes the name from `firm_name(prefix)`. The
#                      overrun is in a span that is not read. Nothing to repair.
#
#   firm_conj (7)      The scanner set the ampersand as `<fc`, `6c` or `it`, so FIRM
#                      never fired and `Bowen & Cole` is read as a man. Capping would
#                      truncate it to `Bowen` and MINT A MAN WHO IS NOT IN THE BOOK —
#                      strictly worse than the run-on. The span is exactly
#                      `Name <conj> Name`, which is what this refusal tests. Widening
#                      FIRM to read those three tokens as ampersands is a separate
#                      ruling about firm/person classification, and `it` is an English
#                      word, so it was filed as its own ticket rather than smuggled in.
#                      THAT TICKET IS MADE (T-1021, CONJ_AMPERSAND above): all seven
#                      are ruled firms on the book's own second printing of each
#                      partnership, the character is lifted by named span, and with it
#                      lifted there is no overrun left — the name and the prefix are
#                      the same three tokens — so the seven move to OVERRUN_HEALED.
#                      The refusal is kept and now stands EMPTY on this reading: it is
#                      the net under the table, so an eighth span of this shape is
#                      refused rather than read, and fails the ratchet below for having
#                      no row in OVERRUN_CLASSES.
#
#   split_surname (4)  The comma IS Norris's name comma and the prefix stops INSIDE a
#                      surname the scanner broke in two: `Went worth, Geo. W.`,
#                      `Lurk in, Timothy`, `Woi thinglnm, Wm.`, `Brine kerb off, John`.
#                      `name_prefix` breaks on the lower-case second half. Capping
#                      would read Wentworth as `Went`. The tell is that the span holds
#                      no capitalised token after the first — no forename, no initial,
#                      so no trade can have started — and a forename stands after the
#                      comma.
#
#   empty_prefix (5)   The reading begins at the trade, so the prefix is empty and the
#                      cap would set the surname to `''` — which drops the claim out of
#                      crosswalk_norris_1844.py, silently, because it skips a claim
#                      with no surname. These are turned lines the entry-boundary rule
#                      mis-cut (`ady` for `<'ady, Dennis S.`) or margin droppings. They
#                      need a ruling of their own; an empty prefix is a REFUSAL.
#
# A refused entry reads exactly as it did before this ticket, and says so on the claim
# in `normalized.name_overrun`. `--self-test` asserts the counts of all five classes.

# GARBLED FORENAMES, REPAIRED (T-0695)

# archive.org's OCR sets characters no compositor ever did — `C!;as.` for Chas.,

# `tools/name_agreement.garbled()` names them, and a crosswalk refusal raised
# against one of them is a transcription defect, not two people disagreeing.
#
# THE REPAIR MOVES THE READING ONLY. `quote` and `normalized.as_printed` keep
# the damage — the reading_note below is the standing convention, and a tidied
# quote cannot be found again. `normalized.given`, `normalized.printed_name` and
# the claim's `entities` carry the repair, and every repaired claim states it in
# `normalized.given_repair`, so a reader of the card sees both readings.
#
# THE EVIDENCE IS THE SECOND READING, NOT THIS TOOL'S GUESS. Kim Torp typed this
# same directory from the printed page for genealogytrails.com in 2002, off a
# different copy; her transcription is cached at
# `data/research/genealogytrails/text/` and every row below cites it by file and
# line, so the repair can be argued with against a hand that was not this one.
# Where SHE cannot read the token either, the entry stays damaged — see
# UNREPAIRED. Nothing here is inferred from the person the crosswalk would like
# to match: `Hale, J>ctij. F.` reads Benj. F., not the John Hale of 1835.
#
# `surname` + `as_read` is the key, and `--self-test` fails if a row stops
# matching exactly one entry or if a new garbled forename appears with no row.

# THE SURNAME THE CROSSWALK CANNOT SEE (T-0987 stretch 10)
#
# `crosswalk_norris_1844.py` reaches an 1835 person through the SURNAME and nothing
# else: a fold, then the first initial. So a surname the scanner destroyed does not
# make a bad match — it makes NO match, and no refusal either. The entry is not in
# the pool at all, and nothing downstream can tell the difference between a name the
# volume does not print and a name it prints that this reading could not read.
#
# `data/research/directories/second_readings/norris_1844_genealogytrails.json` is where
# they were found — it had held them since T-0576 and nothing had gone back to it.
# That file is a COMPARISON of the committed reading against Kim Torp's independent
# transcription, and its own README says a reconciliation lands in `../claims/` and is
# said there. Of its 67 disagreeing entries, 25 disagree about the SURNAME. Every one of the 25 was cropped from the archive.org page image on its own
# word box and read by eye — the same discipline as IMAGE_REPAIRS above, and the same
# citation fields, so a reader can go back to the ink.
#
# WHAT THE INK SAID, in three classes:
#
#   sixteen repaired (below). The scanner set a character no compositor did —
#   `Buticifit'ld` for Butterfield, `(JrisivoM` for Griswold, `Hjolrnes` for Holmes,
#   `JYIcCanny` for McCanny — or a letter for its neighbour: `Bolsford`, `Hasted`,
#   `Patient`, `Gilmorc`. The image prints the second hand's reading in all fourteen.
#
#   two UPHELD, and they matter as much. `Sealey, George` and `Kautenburger, Peter`
#   are where Kim Torp is wrong and the OCR is right; the image prints Sealey and
#   Kautenburger. Nothing is repaired and the rows are kept, because a reconciliation
#   that only ever moved toward the second hand would not be a reading of the page.
#
#   seven left alone. Four are firms whose ampersand the scanner set as `<fc`, `it`,
#   `6c` or `A;` — T-1018 refuses that class by name and files it as its own ruling
#   about firm/person classification, and this stretch does not smuggle it in. Two are
#   firms the ampersand DID reach, `Moseley & SIcCord` and `Whit'mc, Magill & Co.`,
#   whose garbled span the firm branch never reads and no crosswalk ever sees. One,
#   `Jones, K. K.`, has the surname right already and disagrees only about a speck in
#   the left margin, which `clean_head` was written to drop.
#
# THREE OF THE FOURTEEN ALSO LOSE THE FORENAME, and that is the separator. Norris sets
# `Surname, Given`; this printing sets a proportion of those commas with the tail
# unprinted, and the image shows a clean round point after Bates, Gilmore and
# Woodbury. T-1018's cap catches most of that class, but not where the run-on is only
# two words long — `Bates. John` read as one surname with a given name of `jr`,
# `Woodbnry. Hiram` with no given name at all, and `Ryat). John` with a trade of
# `boaniing`. The surname is DOCUMENTED, read off the image. That the point stands
# where the format sets a comma is INFERRED, and the reasoning is that a surname is
# never abbreviated, so a stop immediately after one cannot be an abbreviation point.
#
# THE REPAIR MOVES THE READING ONLY. `quote` and `normalized.as_printed` keep the
# damage, exactly as T-0695 and T-0903 do, and every repaired claim states both
# readings in `normalized.surname_repair`. `as_read` is the head of the printed line
# and `--self-test` fails if a row stops matching exactly one entry.

# THE OTHER THIRTY-SEVEN (T-0987 stretch 11)
#
# Stretch 10 repaired sixteen surnames the scan destroyed, found through the second
# reading's own list of disagreements. It closed by measuring what that list could NOT
# see: 68 person entries still hold a space inside their surname, and once the twelve
# real two-word names, the eight institutions and the eleven firm conjunctions T-1018
# owns are set aside, THIRTY-SEVEN remain — entries whose surname hides them from
# `crosswalk_norris_1844.py` exactly as those sixteen did, and which the comparison
# never flagged because it folds punctuation and spacing before it compares.
#
# THAT FOLD IS THE FINDING. Every one of the thirty-seven is in the comparison's
# `identical` or `agrees` bucket, carrying the second hand's correct line — Brinckerhoff
# for `Brine kerb off`, Larkin for `Lurk in`, Wentworth for `Went worth` — and nothing
# had gone back to it, because the file's own summary counts only `differs`. The answer
# had been in the repository since T-0576.
#
# All thirty-seven were cropped from the archive.org leaf image on their own word box,
# enlarged and read, and then read a SECOND time on a fresh crop at a different
# magnification, in an order shuffled so the reader could not carry the first pass's
# expectation down the page. Both passes are recorded: `reread` is the second.
#
# WHAT THE INK SAID ABOUT THE SEPARATOR, which is where this stretch corrects the one
# before it. Stretch 10 wrote that this printing "sets a proportion of those commas with
# the tail unprinted". For the ten it read, that was what the image showed. Across the
# twenty-seven here it is the MINORITY case:
#
#     15  a comma, tail and all, that the SCANNER read as a point
#     10  a round point on the baseline, with nothing below it
#      2  undecided — the two passes disagreed (Klien, Lahy)
#
# So the common cause is the OCR, not the compositor, and `separator_mark` on every row
# says which one this entry is. The remaining ten of the thirty-seven are not separator
# cases at all: five surnames the scan broke into words (Brinckerhoff, Larkin, McWard,
# Wentworth, Worthingham), one comma welded into the letter beside it (Bandle), one real
# two-word surname with a damaged letter (Van Drezer, whose z was set as a solidus), and
# THREE WHERE THE COMMA IS NOT IN THE INK AT ALL.
#
# THOSE THREE ARE `inferred`, AND THE DISTINCTION IS THE POINT. Brown, Butterfield and
# Carson show clean paper between surname and forename — no comma, no point, no mark of
# any kind, at sixteen times magnification. The surname is still DOCUMENTED, because the
# letters are on the page; the separator this reading supplies is not, so those rows
# carry `confidence: inferred` and the reasoning T-0987 stretch 10 argued: Norris sets
# `Surname, Given` throughout, and a forename standing alone after a surname is that
# format with its comma omitted. Nothing else in the entry moves.
#
# THE REPAIR MOVES THE READING ONLY, on the same terms as every row above: `quote` and
# `normalized.as_printed` keep the damage, `--self-test` fails if a row stops matching
# exactly one entry, and the crosswalk is re-derived in the same commit.
