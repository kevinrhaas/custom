"""The scene-date register: who and what the papers put in Chicago on 1 July 1835.

WHAT THIS IS FOR (T-0262). The reading passes filled `gazetteer.json` with 221
businesses and 2,201 people read out of the 1833-1835 papers. A gazetteer is an
index of what was PRINTED; it says nothing about what the model should build. This
turns it into the register the seeding tickets work from — for every business, is it
standing on the scene date, where, and what does the town have to do about it; for
every person, is that somebody the town already has, somebody it invented a stand-in
for, or somebody new.

NOTHING HERE IS AUTHORED. The register is derived, wholly, from the gazetteer and
from the committed dataset beside it, and `--check` re-derives it and refuses a
committed file that a rebuild would not produce. That is the same contract
gazetteer.json is under and for the same reason: a hand-edited register is a place to
quietly promote a business into the town without an argument.

THE OWNER'S THREE RULINGS, 2026-08-28, and where each one lands here:

  1. A LETTER-LIST NAME IS ENOUGH TO MINT A RESIDENT. So a person known only from the
     post-office lists takes an action like any other — `new_resident` — and carries
     `letter_list_only: true` beside it. The counts report the two strengths
     separately, because 1,594 of the 2,201 are letter-list-only and a total that
     hides that is a number nobody can act on.
  2. TRANSCRIPTION-MEDIATED READINGS GRADE `documented`. Nothing here re-grades
     anything; the flag lives on the claim and travels with it.
  3. A DOCUMENTED BUSINESS IS BUILT AT THE SCENE DATE UNLESS CONTRADICTED — and this
     tool reads the word BEFORE in that ruling, which the gazetteer does not.
     `built_at_scene_date` there is `not contradicted_by`, whatever the contradiction
     is dated: a firm dissolved in August 1835 is struck out of a July town it was
     demonstrably standing in. The exclusion test here is a contradiction dated ON OR
     BEFORE the scene date. A LATER one is recorded, not obeyed —
     `dissolved_after_scene_date` — and the business stands.

TWO EXCLUSIONS, AND THE SECOND ONE NOW READS THE PAPER RATHER THAN A PROXY (T-0356).
T-0262 asked to exclude "entries whose only 1835 evidence `announces_opening` after
Jul 1", and there was no such field to read, so this tool used the derivable proxy
instead: a business whose FIRST issue postdated the scene date was excluded as
`first_evidence_after_scene_date`. Conservative in the direction provenance wants,
and NOT the same question — and the re-read of the thirty-eight it caught is what
settles that. Wm. H. Taylor's boot store advertised over a dateline of 8 JULY 1834,
Wm. H. Kennicott said he had practised dentistry in the town "for the past year",
Samuel Lewis's music-school copy is dated 22 June, S. Abell's 24 June and John
Holbrook's 10 June. Five houses excluded from a town they were printed standing in,
because the first SURVIVING issue that carried them falls in August.

So `announces_opening` is a field now (tools/compile_gazetteer.py § OPENING_DATINGS)
and the exclusion reads it. The DATING is what decides:

  stated    the paper names a date the house WILL open. After the scene date, that is
            the paper saying it was not open then — `opening_announced_after_scene_date`.
            Four houses: Cromelien's wine branch (14 Aug), Everts' high school for young
            gentlemen (10 Aug), Hunt's for young ladies (17 Aug) and Lyon's wholesale
            grocery (1 Sep).
  effected  an opening already made, dated by the advertisement's own dateline. It bounds
            the opening from ABOVE and can never exclude — "has opened", printed on 7
            August, is silent about 1 July. On or before the scene date it is the
            opposite: positive evidence the house stood.
  undated   an opening the printing dates nowhere. It decides nothing either way.

WHAT REPLACED THE PROXY IS NOT NOTHING. A business first printed in August and never
announcing an opening now stands in the July town under ruling 3 — documented, not
contradicted — and that is a LIBERTY, the forward twin of `survival_liberty_required`.
`backdating_liberty_required` names it: existence documented only after the scene date,
presence on the scene date assumed, and no opening notice dated on or before it to
carry the assumption. It is computed here and never asserted, exactly as its twin is.

WHAT AN ACTION MEANS, for the seeding tickets that consume this:

  enrich_existing  a committed structure already carries this business, matched on the
                   proprietors' surnames. The town needs a fuller record, not a roof.
  new_building     nothing committed carries it AND the paper's own placement resolves
                   against the committed town — a corner of two platted streets, or a
                   landmark that is a committed structure, or one hop through another
                   documented business that is. Placeable; T-0263's queue.
  street_only      documented and placeable no further than a street face. The paper
                   named a street this town has, and nothing narrower.
  unplaceable      no street the model holds, OR the firm's own record puts it out of
                   town (T-0355, `outside_plat`). Recorded, not buildable.

AND WHAT A PERSON ACTION MEANS:

  enrich           `data/residents/` already holds this person, matched under the
                   gazetteer's OWN identity policy (surname plus forename initials,
                   imported from compile_gazetteer so the two tools cannot drift).
  replace_invented a documented person whose occupation is one the town INVENTED a
                   household for. The candidate to retire that invention (T-0264).
  new_resident     everybody else. Ruling 1: a letter-list name is enough.

THE RETIREMENT COUNT IS A COUNT OF INVENTED HOUSEHOLDS, NOT OF PEOPLE, and it is
capped per trade by construction: three documented tailors retire at most the number
of invented tailors the town holds. Reporting the matched persons instead would
report 2,201 people retiring 133 households, which is not a number about anything.

    An ordinal counts doors from a CORNER, and a corner is a crossing. Two streets being

    both east-west lines of the Original Town and run parallel for their whole length.**
    Clark, Filer & Co. advertise "their ware house on South water St. five doors east of
    the corner of Randolph st.", and the first three tests pass it — two platted streets,
    not the same one — so without this test the register would count five doors east of a
    corner that has never existed and stand a documented warehouse on it.

    The answer is taken from `data/streets/1835.json`'s committed `path_local_enu_m`, the
    same geometry every other placement is measured against, by segment intersection.
    Nothing is inferred: if the plat's own lines meet, there is a corner, and if they do

    """A count of doors off a named cross street, resolved — or None.

    **The owner's ruling of 2026-08-30 (T-0384), in code.** Asked whether "one door from
    Dearborn street" places a store or is a street and nothing narrower, he chose: *read
    it as an ordinal off the corner*. So the phrase is NARROWER than the street it stands
    on — it counts doors from a crossing, which is a position along a face — and this
    reading runs BEFORE the `street` fallback and AFTER the landmark ones, which is the
    whole of its precedence:

    - after `structure` and `business`, so "first door west of Jones, King & Co." stays a
      landmark hop. An ordinal off a BUILDING is placed by that building and was always
      read that way; nothing about those claims changes here.
    - before `street`, because a reach of a street is what this phrase was being read as
      and is exactly the reading the owner overturned.

    Three things must hold, and each refuses a real phrase rather than a hypothetical one:

    1. the offset counts DOORS, in a word this project will translate to a number.
       'a few doors below Messrs. Newberry & Dole' names no count and stays unresolved.
    2. its reference resolves to exactly ONE platted street, suffix required — the same
       test `street` uses, so a phrase that could not have been read as a street cannot
       be read as an ordinal off one either.
    3. the business's OWN street is platted and is a different street. "two doors north
       of Lake street" said by a house on Lake Street is not an ordinal off a corner;
       the crossing an ordinal counts from is the crossing of two streets.
    4. the two streets MEET on the committed plat. Different is not crossing, and the
       corpus prints the difference: Randolph and South Water are parallel east-west
       lines of the Original Town, so Clark, Filer & Co.'s "five doors east of the corner
       of Randolph st." counts from a corner that does not exist. Asked of the streets'
       own centrelines by `streets_cross`; see T-0771.

    What comes back names the crossing in `streets` (the pair, as `corner` does) and the
    reading itself in `ordinal`, so a gate can read the count without parsing prose.
    **The count is the source's; the metres between two doors are this project's** —
    `docs/CORNER-ORDINAL.md` and L215 own that arithmetic, and no part of it is here.
