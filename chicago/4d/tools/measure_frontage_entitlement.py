"""What a party-line run was DEALT, and what it actually STANDS ON.

T-0199. Five documented South Water Street stores could not be reconciled with the
committed plat because each, put back on its own street line, seats on a platted lot
the 665-roof schedule had already dealt to the anonymous frontage run standing on that
block face — and `tools/generate_block_infill.py` refused, in its own words, to "deal a
roof to a lot that already carries one". T-0188 named all five in writing and left the
untangling to this instrument, because the question underneath them cannot be answered
by reading the recipe: **does the run stand on the lots it was dealt?**

Measured on the committed dataset, it does not, and not by a little. Of the eight
anonymous roofs on the three blocks in question, every one stands on lot 4 or lot 2 —
and the recipes deal those runs lots 0, 2 and 4. Three lots of frontage were entitled
and one or two were occupied, because a run PACKS from one end of its own strip and
`ROW_UNITS_PER_LOT` of its units fit inside a single lot of this grid.

**That gap is not a defect in the recipes; it is what T-0079 built.** Before the core
density standard a run carried exactly one roof per lot it was dealt, so "dealt" and
"stood on" were the same list and nothing distinguished them. T-0079 retired that — a
row is a claim about the FACE, bounded by the metres of frontage it stands on and not
by the conjectural side lines it crosses — and the two lists came apart the moment it
landed. Nothing measured them apart until a documented building wanted the difference.

So the refusal these five met was the PRE-T-0079 ceiling still standing at the gate:
one roof to a lot, applied to a layer whose whole point is that it is denser than the
lot grid. The rule this module authors is the same protection expressed in the unit
T-0079 established, and it is not looser where it matters:

    a run's frontage carries ROW_UNITS_PER_LOT units per lot it was dealt, and
    every roof already standing on those lots counts against that ceiling.

A block dealt one lot and carrying three units is at its ceiling under both rules, so
nothing that was refused for want of ground is now let through — `blk_lake_clark` and
both `blk_randolph_dearborn` deals sit at exactly 3 of 3 and a documented roof seating
on their lot would still fail. What changes is the block that was refused for want of
an ENTITLEMENT it was not using: three units against nine, with six units of frontage
unbuilt and a documented store standing out in the roadway because a list said the lot
was spoken for.

Nothing here authors a coordinate or a count. `ROW_UNITS_PER_LOT` is imported from
`tools/reconcile_665.py`, where the schedule deals against it; occupancy is
`tools/plat_occupancy.py`, the same module the gate and the schedule already share; and
the run's own units are read out of the committed records' `reconstruction.frontage`.

T-0233 ASKED WHETHER THE GAP IS A DEFECT OR A RESERVATION. IT IS A RESERVATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reading above left one question open, and it had to be answered before anything
moved: a run dealt three lots and standing on one — **is the unbuilt remainder the
schedule HOARDING ground, or is it frontage the run is entitled to and has not filled
yet?** Both readings are defensible from the table alone. They are not defensible from
the code, and this is the argument from the code.

**It is a reservation, and the defect reading's promised payoff does not exist.** The
case for "defect" rested on one claim — that the schedule is charged for every lot it
deals, so shrinking the deals would recover headroom. Measured, the schedule is charged
for none of them:

    tools/reconcile_665.py:915    free = lots - len(available.get(block["id"], ()))
    tools/reconcile_665.py:813    available = exclusive_lots(grid, datum)

`free_lots` — the only thing `block_rooms()` turns into `principal_room`, and so the
only route from a lot to `schedulable_on_committed_ground` — is derived from committed
FOOTPRINTS through `plat_occupancy.exclusive_lots`. It has never read
`frontage["lots"]`. A lot a recipe dealt and nobody built on carries no footprint, so it
arrives at the schedule as FREE and the schedule deals principal room against it
already. There is no headroom to recover, because none was ever spent.

The table's own eight lots say the same thing from the other end. "Carries none of its
run's own roofs" is not "carries nothing", and the three cases are worth separating,
which is why `survey()` now classifies them (`idle_class` below):

    lot                                   what actually stands on it
    blk_south_water_franklin   lot 2      nothing
    blk_south_water_franklin   lot 4      the parcel's own yard building (a3_07)
    blk_south_water_wells      lot 0      H. Jones's store, and the parcel's a3_08
    blk_south_water_lasalle    lot 0      nothing
    blk_south_water_lasalle    lot 2      nothing
    blk_south_water_clark      lot 2      Pruyne & Kimball's drugstore
    blk_south_water_dearborn   lot 0      the Chicago American office, and a3_06
    blk_south_water_dearborn   lot 2      Frederick Thomas's shop

Five of the eight are built on — three by a documented store the owner's 2026-08-27
business-front clause seats there, three by the run's own parcel's yard buildings (two
lots carry both). **Three lots in the whole town carry nothing at all**, and every one
of those three reads free to the schedule: `blk_south_water_franklin` is `open` with 3
principal rooms and `blk_south_water_lasalle` with 6, dealt against exactly this ground.

So the headline figure was measuring the distance between two lists that T-0079 made
different ON PURPOSE, and reading it as waste. A run's deal is its STRIP —
`frontage_strip()` projects the dealt lots onto the face, requires them to adjoin, and
returns one continuous stretch that `check_frontage()` then holds every unit inside. To
re-deal a run only the lots it stands on would not free ground; it would make a new and
unsourced claim, that the rest of that face is not this run's frontage, and would owe
each surrendered lot a twelve-word `open_lots` reason nobody has the evidence to write.

The reservation is not free, and the one price it does pay is the right one: a dealt lot
is `built on by this parcel` in `generate_block_infill.py`'s four-class lot accounting,
so it cannot also be `named open in the recipe` or take a second principal roof. That IS
the reservation being registered. The single case where it cost something real — a
documented store refused the ground under it — the owner settled by rule in #371, and
`exclusive_lots` is why three of the eight lots above carry a store today.

What the ticket found, then, is its second half exactly: **the count was correct and
nobody could see it.** So this file is wired into `tools/check.sh` rather than left as a
command somebody remembers to run, and `--self-test` demonstrates the gate FAILING —
`blk_lake_clark` and both `blk_randolph_dearborn` deals sit at exactly 3 of 3, so one
synthetic roof on one of their lots is the fixture, and a gate nobody has watched fail
has not been tested.

    and by then #371 had independently given `plat_occupancy.lot_holders` the identical
    shape — `{block: {lot: [ids]}}` — for the owner's business-front clause. So the
    salvage imports dev's function rather than re-landing a second copy of it.

    The one behaviour that does not carry over is the dedupe, and it is not cosmetic
    here. `footprints()` yields EVERY committed phase, so a structure rebuilt on a
    footprint that seats on the same lot twice appears in that lot's list twice. Every
    caller on dev today reads the list for a NAME (`occupied_lots` takes `ids[0]`,
    the clause asks what is standing there), and a name is unharmed by a repeat. This
    module is the first caller that reads it as a COUNT, and a count is not: a
    two-phase rebuild would spend a lot's frontage twice and read a run over its
    ceiling that is not.

    Measured on the committed dataset 2026-08-27: **no lot lists any id twice**, so
    this changes no number today. It is here because the hazard is real and silent —
    the instrument would simply report a larger figure and look like a finding.

    Deliberately NOT pushed down into `lot_holders`: that function is shared with the
