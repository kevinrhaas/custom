"""Trace the South Branch south of the forks window, off Wright 1834.

The southern companion to `tools/trace_river.py` (the forks) and
`tools/trace_shoreline.py` (the harbour and the lake). Those two leave a gap
this one fills: Wright draws the South Branch on past the forks box, out of the
Original Town, across Madison Street and down through the School Section's
blocks 70, 71, 78 and 83-88 to the section's south line, and the project's
committed water stopped at the forks window's own edge.

    python3 tools/trace_south_branch.py            re-trace and write the GeoJSON
    python3 tools/trace_south_branch.py --check    re-trace and diff against committed
    python3 tools/trace_south_branch.py --debug    also write a PNG overlay
    python3 tools/trace_south_branch.py --check-properties
                                                   hold the committed file to this
                                                   file's literals: no numpy, no
                                                   network. This one IS in check.sh.

Why a third window rather than a bigger second one
--------------------------------------------------
`trace_river.py` says it in its own docstring and it is still true: the forks
work at a LOCAL block percentile, which is what lets a 70 m channel be found in
a town of coloured ward washes. Widening that window instead of adding one would
move every vertex the forks trace has already committed, because the morphology
that finds the channel is computed over the whole window — and the ground is
carved from those vertices. So this is a separate window whose NORTH edge is the
forks window's SOUTH edge (map row 2372), which makes the splice a declared line
rather than a tolerance: `river.geojson` is not touched by this tool at all, and
the two polygons abut on a row of the scan both of them name.

The one setting that had to change, and what it cost to find out
---------------------------------------------------------------
The hue reference. `wash_mask` separates Wright's grey bank wash from his
coloured ward washes by asking whether a pixel departs in hue from THE LOCAL
PAPER, and it estimates the local paper's hue as a percentile over a block of
`hue_block` pixels. At the forks, 280 px at the 40th percentile is paper. Here
it is not: from map row 3580 to row 3985 the channel runs right alongside the
yellow wash of the School Section's reserved blocks 87 and 88, a 280 px block
straddles the two, and the 40th percentile of it is the YELLOW. Measured over
that reach the grey bank wash then departs from its own reference by 27 units
against a tolerance of 11, so it was thrown away as a coloured wash: 400 px of
river — 285 m, the whole stretch between the two bridge symbols — simply did not
exist for the segmentation, and the channel came out as two disconnected pieces.
The fix is to read the paper off the LEAST tinted part of a SMALLER block
(`hue_block` 160, `hue_pct` 15) so the reference is paper even where paper is the
minority of the neighbourhood. The reach then comes out whole, from one seed,
with no hand-placed waypoints along it.

`open_r` also goes from 9 to 12, which is not a threshold so much as a knife: a
4,000 px patch of stained paper in the West Division, near block 51, hangs off
the channel by a neck the 9 px opening leaves standing. Widening the opening
severs it and changes the channel's own width at no station on the reach — that
is asserted below, not assumed.

The tear, and where it is not
-----------------------------
T-0794 asked this trace to say where the manuscript's missing portion falls,
because the Historic Urban Plans reproduction of the NARA original carries the
caption "Two portions are missing, the larger being near the lower center ...
the manuscript was mounted on cloth to repair this tear", and the lower centre
of the sheet is exactly blocks 87 and 88. It is not on THIS scan. The BPL master
this project traces carries the reach whole: both banks are drawn unbroken past
the reserved blocks, the two bridge symbols on it are intact, and the only thing
the region does carry is the yellow reservation wash described above — which is
what made the reach look absent to the machine and is a fact about the
reference, not about the paper. So nothing here is graded down for the tear and
no gap is boxed. See docs/RESEARCH/south_branch_school_section.md.

Needs numpy, scipy, Pillow and the network. Like the other two traces the full
re-run is a deliberate, occasional one and is not part of tools/check.sh; it
degrades to a clear skip when the dependencies are missing. `--check-properties`
is the half that costs nothing, and check.sh runs it.
