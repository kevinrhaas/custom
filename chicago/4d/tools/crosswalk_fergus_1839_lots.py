"""The Fort Dearborn Addition bidders of June 1839 against the pools of 1835 names (T-0666).

The sibling of `crosswalk_fergus_1839_election.py`, and like it, it imports
`crosswalk_fergus_1839`'s matching rule rather than restating it, so the three cannot
drift on the part that matters: SURNAME must match after both are folded, AND the first
initial of the given name must match. A surname-only agreement is a REFUSAL. One 1835
name meeting more than one bidder is AMBIGUOUS; two 1835 people meeting one bidder is
CONTESTED and no match is made.

WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS POOL, and it is the reason for a separate file. The 1839
directory gives a trade and a street. The 1837 poll gives a ward and a vote. This list
gives A PRICE AND A LOT, and the lot is the thing to be careful with: it is ground in
the FORT DEARBORN ADDITION, which was the garrison's reservation in July 1835 and was
not lots at all. So a match here says the man was in Chicago in June 1839 and had money
to bid; it does NOT place him, or his house, or his trade, anywhere in the town of 1835.
The block and lot are carried on the match so a later pass can see them, and they are
labelled 1839 ground on every one.

THE OTHER HAZARD IS THE SPELLING, and it is worse here than on the poll pages. This
list is initials and abbreviations almost throughout — `L. R. Lyon`, `Thos. Dyer`,
`Geo. L. Campbell`, `J. H. Kinzie` — so the initial rule is doing nearly all the work
and the surname is doing the rest. `crosswalk_fergus_1839`'s fold and its refusal of a
surname-only agreement are what keep that honest, and the refusals are filed as fully
as the matches for the same reason they are there: an absent match reads exactly like a
pair nobody has looked at.

A PROPOSAL. This file mints nobody and regrades nobody. T-0514 and T-0515 are the
passes allowed to write people; this is what they read.
