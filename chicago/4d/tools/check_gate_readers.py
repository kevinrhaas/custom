"""T-1083 — the gate's own install set, asserted instead of assumed.

Thirteen of the steps `tools/check.sh` runs re-read a committed raster, and each of
them degrades POLITELY when the image and array libraries are absent: it stands on a
banked reading, prints its skip, and exits 0. That is right for a tool a person runs
in a sandbox. It is wrong for a GATE, which then counts the skip as a pass.

It was not hypothetical. `.github/workflows/chicago-4d-check.yml` installed
`jsonschema pyproj openpyxl pypdf` and nothing else, so the dev gate had never once
re-read a sheet. Measured on dev at 33638aa69, running check.sh twice on the same
tree — once with the CI set, once with numpy/scipy/Pillow added — TWO steps changed
behaviour and one of them went red:

    FAIL sauganash_range_m moved from 1066.3 to 1001.2 (tolerance 1.0)

65.1 m of drift against a 1.0 m tolerance, green in CI since T-1065 (#1189) moved
the lighthouse onto Wright's own glyph.

So the workflow now installs the readers, and this asserts that it did. Two states,
deliberately different:

  * `C4D_GATE_REQUIRE_READERS=1` (the workflow sets it) — a missing reader is RED.
    The gate may not degrade. Ever.
  * unset (an agent sandbox, a laptop) — a missing reader is a WARNING that names
    every step now standing on a banked reading, and the gate goes on.

A step that starts re-reading a raster adds itself to READERS below. That is the
whole maintenance burden, and it is the point: the list is what CI installs.
