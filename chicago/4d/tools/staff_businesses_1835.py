"""THE STAFFING JOIN, ATTESTED AND INFERRED HALF: where the named people worked.

T-1432, piece 1 of 3 of T-1189.

    tools/staff_businesses_1835.py --build       write persons[].workplaces and the report
    tools/staff_businesses_1835.py --check       re-derive, refuse drift, assert the join
    tools/staff_businesses_1835.py --self-test   the guards, fired on the real join

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. The business layer names 196 people across its records —
proprietors, partners and, so far, one apprentice — and 144 of those rows carry a
`person_id`, 110 distinct town cards between them. So the register knows where
those people worked. **Their own cards did not.** `persons[]` has never held a
workplace at all; `works_at` existed only on the HOUSEHOLD, where it is a singular,
undated structure id — a PLACE. A man who kept a store and a card that said nothing
about a store were the same person read from two ends, with nothing holding the two
ends together. This tool writes the join down on the person's side and puts a gate
on it, so the two ends can no longer drift apart in silence.

WHAT IT IS NOT. It mints nobody, reads no page of any source, and invents no
employment. Every row it writes is a row the business layer already carries,
carried across at ITS OWN tier with ITS OWN basis, source and claim ids. An
`inferred` hand joins as `inferred`; nothing is upgraded by being copied. The
reconstructed residents who have a trade and no workplace are T-1433's, and the
shortfall against the staffing model — the clerks and journeymen the model says the
town's houses employed and no source names — is T-1434's. Both are named in the
report so the gap stays visible rather than reading as a finished job.

A PRINTED NAME WITH NO CARD IS A STATEMENT ABOUT THE EVIDENCE. 53 of the layer's
person rows carry `person_id: null` — a name the register could not match to a town
card. They are counted in the report and they are never invented into one. Writing a
card for "Brewster" because a notice printed "Brewster, Hogan & Co." is exactly the
move this project refuses.

WHY THE FIELD IS `workplaces` AND NOT `works_at`, WHICH IS WHAT T-1189 ASKED FOR.
`works_at` is already taken, and it means something else: on a household it is a
SINGULAR, UNDATED structure id — the building — and `tools/validate.py` and
`tools/associations.py` both police it as one, on persons as well as on households.
A list of dated employments under that name would have read as a second opinion about
the same field, and the gate would have refused it as a malformed link. So the place a
person WORKED keeps its word, and the firms they worked FOR get their own: one entry a
(house, role), dated, graded and cited. The two answer different questions and now say
so.

THE JOIN IS BIDIRECTIONAL AND THE GATE ASSERTS IT BOTH WAYS. A `workplaces` entry with
no business record naming that person back in that role is a fossil, and a named row
with no entry is a person whose card has quietly lost their trade. Either one is a
failure here; neither is a warning.
