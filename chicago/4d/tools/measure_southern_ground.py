"""How much buildable ground the town actually has south of its committed plat.

ROADMAP T-E4 / ticket T-0026. The parcel was opened on a reading of the 1830 sheet —
*"the owner is right that south is where the room is"* — and it told the next run to
widen the eligible ground southward and let `tools/reconcile_665.py` re-apportion the
remainder onto it. Its own acceptance names the condition: a roof may stand only where
the ground is **covered by the heightfield AND historically plausible**.

MEASURED AGAINST THE COMMITTED HEIGHTFIELD, THE PREMISE DID NOT SURVIVE — AND THEN THE
TERRAIN MOVED. Written for T-0026, this command found the modelled box ending at local
**N -400 m**, a line falling INSIDE Washington Street's own 80 ft corridor: south of the
platted corridor that carried the town's southernmost committed street, the field held
0.0819 ha of land, all of it on the far bank of the South Branch and **none** of it in
the South Division. Madison Street, the plat's south boundary, was 125.2 m further south
again, and the plat's last tier of blocks — 6 blocks, 48 lots, 6.28 ha between Market and
State — had **0 of 24** block-boundary points on modelled ground.

T-0219 answered that, by the only route the reading left open: `tools/trace_river.py`'s
window was extended 280 px south on the same Wright 1834 sheet, both South Branch banks
were carried with it to N -607, and `n_min` moved to N -530 — 4.8 m past Madison's line
at State. The tier now stands 24 of 24 on modelled ground.

**Which does not make the command obsolete, and is exactly why it is a gate.** The three
figures are still re-derived on every run, and the assertions below are unchanged: the
question "is a platted block standing off the field" has to keep being asked, because
every north-south column of the south plat still has its committed centreline cut at
N -400 and carrying one south is now a thing a run can do. What has changed is the
ANSWER, and the two figures `coverage_figures` added for it — `tier_ring_points_on_field`
against `tier_ring_points` — are what let `tools/reconcile_665.py` state the South's
blocker from the measurement rather than from a sentence somebody typed.

1. **Land south of Washington's platted corridor.** Every cell of the committed field
   above the datum water surface, south of the corridor's south edge, classified by
   division. It was 0.0819 ha with nothing in the South Division; it is now 17.67 ha,
   12.98 ha of it South Division.
2. **Where Madison Street runs.** Its line is not traced: it is resolved the way T-E2
   resolved the reservation's south boundary, from the PLSS section corner at State &
   Madison (`G1`, the town plat's SE corner) carried on the plat's own east-west bearing,
   which Lake, Randolph and Washington agree on to the sixth decimal. The field's south
   edge is now 4.8 m south of it rather than 125.2 m north.
3. **How much of the plat's last tier is modelled.** Built by the plat module's own
   `build_block`, the six blocks between Market and State that Washington and Madison
   bound. 0 of 24 boundary points before; 24 of 24 now.

**So the blocker the 665-roof programme names for the South has changed twice.** It said
street control: *"no block south of Washington has four committed centrelines"*. T-0026
showed that was true but downstream — street control stopped where the ground did. With
the ground carried to Madison, street control is what is left, and it is now a blocker a
parcel can actually clear: the modern control that would carry the columns south is
already committed (G1 is an OpenStreetMap node with an id and a 13.9 m residual).

    tools/measure_southern_ground.py             the report
    tools/measure_southern_ground.py --gate      the two assertions
    tools/measure_southern_ground.py --self-test prove both assertions still fire

The two assertions, and why each is worth having:

* **No committed platted block stands off the modelled ground.** Absolute, zero today,
  and it is the assertion that fires the day a centreline is carried south without the
  terrain following: the failure then arrives here, at the commit, naming the block —
  instead of arriving inside a parcel run as a per-placement "falls outside the modelled
  terrain" that reads like a bad recipe.
* **The programme's stated southern coverage is the measured one.** `reconcile_665.py`
  writes these figures into `coverage`; a terrain extension that opens southern ground
  and is not re-derived fails here. This is the same shape as T-E2's under-coverage
  count, and for the same reason: a number that can go stale in silence is a number the
  next parcel will schedule against.

Exit 0 pass, 1 on a failed assertion, 2 if the inputs cannot be read.
