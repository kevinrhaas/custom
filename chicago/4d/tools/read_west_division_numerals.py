"""Re-derive the West Division's eighteen block-numeral crops from committed street lines.

T-1095, piece 2 of 2 of T-1089, itself split out of T-0858. Wright writes a
numeral across the middle of every block of the Original Town. T-0788 read
twenty-four of them by cutting each crop from that block's OWN committed street
lines — an identification made by the georeference rather than by the reader's
eye — T-1088 read the North Division's seven the same way once that tier's
streets landed, and T-1094 read the Washington-Madison tier's seven once Madison
Street did. What was left refused was the West Division: **8-13, 22-27 and
46-51**, eighteen numerals on the far side of the South Branch, refused because
"no committed street line reaches them, so no crop can be cut". This file cuts
them, and says exactly what each side of each box is standing on.

THE THREE KINDS OF SIDE, AND WHICH BLOCKS USE WHICH.

  committed          `clinton` and `canal` are in data/streets/1835.json and run
                     the length of the division; `kinzie`/`kinzie_west` and
                     `madison` reach the whole width. Four of the eighteen boxes
                     (8, 13, 23, 50) are flanked east and west by committed lines
                     and nothing else.
  continued          `carroll`, `fulton`, `lake`, `randolph` and `washington` are
                     committed but CLIPPED AT EAST -320 m — the clip is this
                     reconstruction's own extent, not a claim that the street
                     ended there (the note on `fulton` says so). Each is continued
                     WEST along the bearing of its own committed path. `clinton`
                     and `canal` are continued north and south the same way where
                     a tier lies past their ends. This is T-1094's rule turned
                     through ninety degrees.
  stepped            Jefferson Street and Des Plaines Street are REFUSED as
                     streets — both lie wholly west of the modelled ground's edge
                     at east -320 m, and docs/RESEARCH/west_division_streets.md §2
                     refuses them on exactly that ground. So they are not read
                     from here and nothing is written into data/streets/1835.json.
                     The two flanks they would give are instead `clinton` STEPPED
                     WEST by one and two modules, the module being the same
                     123.36 m the Original Town's seven flanking lines measure at
                     Madison Street (tools/read_washington_madison_numerals.py's
                     figure, and T-1088's before it). Blocks 22 and 51 are flanked
                     east by the river, not a street, and take `canal` stepped one
                     module EAST — block 52's rule in T-1094, and block 7's in
                     T-1088.

WHAT CORROBORATES THE STEP, three ways and all of them already committed:

  * `clinton` + one module lands on the committed `canal` to **2.34 m** at the
    scene's south edge and **0.46 m** at Lake Street. (It opens to 12 m at Kinzie,
    where `canal` bends west and `clinton` does not; the northern tiers' Clinton-
    Canal boxes are cut from the two committed lines themselves, so the step is
    not asked to carry that.)
  * `clinton` - one module lands **8.71 m** west of the surviving Jefferson x
    Fulton intersection, and `clinton` - two modules **8.23 m** west of Des
    Plaines x Fulton — both intersections already committed in `fulton`'s note in
    data/streets/1835.json, read from OpenStreetMap by T-0446. Eight metres on a
    123 m module, and both to the same side, is a seat and not a scatter.
  * every one of the eighteen numerals lands inside the box the rule cuts for it,
    with no overhang anywhere. That is eighteen independent chances for the rule
    to put a numeral in the wrong block, taken and not missed.

AND THE READING CHECKS ITSELF. The numbers are a boustrophedon: each tier's run
reverses the one above it. This file asserts that — every tier band, read west to
east, is monotonic, and consecutive bands run opposite ways — and it asserts it
ACROSS the blocks other tickets already read, so the West Division's 26 27 joins
T-0788's 28 29 rising eastward, its 47 46 joins T-0788's 45 44 43 rising
westward, and its 48 49 50 51 joins T-1094's 52 rising eastward. A numeral
misread, or a box cut onto the wrong block, breaks that alternation.

WHAT THIS FILE IS. The DERIVATION of the crop boxes, not the reading. The reading
lives in `data/traces/thompson_block_numbering.json` § blocks_not_in_the_grid,
one entry per block, each citing the IIIF region it was read on. This tool
recomputes those regions from the committed street lines, checks every read
window still lies wholly inside the box it is cited under, and fails if either
has drifted. It authors no ground: `tools/generate_plat_lots.py` emits the three
South Division tiers and nothing west of the river, so there is no cell for these
numbers to be stamped onto, and they wait with the North Division's seven and the
Washington-Madison tier's seven.
