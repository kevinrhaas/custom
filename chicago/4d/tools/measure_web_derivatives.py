"""Does the file the site ships still describe the building the repository baked?

ROADMAP K36(a). The geometry a visitor downloads reaches them along four links:

    data/  ->  assets/gltf/  ->  assets/web/  ->  site/chicago/4d/assets/web/

Link 1 is gated: `validate.py --stale` recomputes every master's input hash, so a
record edited into a different building fails. Link 3 is gated: `check_published.mjs`
asserts every published file is byte-identical to its source. **Link 2 was gated by
nothing at all** — no committed number, no hash, no assertion tied a shipped
derivative to the master it was compressed from — and it is the link with the moving
parts: `tools/bake.sh` runs two `gltf-transform` passes over every master, and its own
comments record what has already gone wrong in there:

  * *"a bug that collapsed every building to a two-metre box shipped past a fully
    green gate — twice"*;
  * `--texture-compress ktx2` *"silently turned every derivative into an uncompressed
    copy of its master, in every environment, since this step was written"*;
  * `optimize` runs mesh simplification by default, which on this dataset is damage
    rather than optimisation, so the bake passes `--simplify false` — a flag, in a
    script, with nothing asserting the outcome.

Every one of those was found by a person reading the script. This reads the bytes.

    tools/measure_web_derivatives.py                 print the census
    tools/measure_web_derivatives.py --gate          exit 1 on a divergence
    tools/measure_web_derivatives.py --self-test     break each assertion, in memory
    tools/measure_web_derivatives.py --write-baseline   bank a repair (deliberate act)

NO BLENDER, NO DECODER, NO NETWORK. Only the glTF JSON chunk is read. Positions in a
shipped derivative are EXT_meshopt_compression payloads this project cannot decode
here — but every claim below is answerable from the JSON alone, because the glTF spec
requires POSITION accessors to carry `min`/`max`, and a quantised file carries its
dequantisation in the node's own TRS. Counting triangles, composing node transforms
and comparing material tables costs about a second for all 334 assets.

## The assertions

1.  **Bijection** (absolute). Every master has a derivative and every derivative has a
    master. A derivative whose master was deleted is a building on the site that the
    dataset no longer describes.

2.  **Triangle count** (absolute). Equal, per asset. This is the assertion behind
    `--simplify false`: the flag says what the bake asks for, this says what arrived.

3.  **Identity** (absolute). Node names, node `extras` — `structure_id`, `phase_id` —
    and mesh names survive. These are the join key the sidecars and the provenance
    card use; a derivative that lost them is anonymous geometry.

4.  **The contract's attributes** (absolute). `docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md` names POSITION,
    NORMAL and `_CONFIDENCE`; whichever the master carries, the shipped file carries.
    `_CONFIDENCE` is how a visitor is told which parts we made up, and it travels in
    the mesh rather than in a sidecar. TEXCOORD_0 is deliberately NOT in this list:
    the master's UVs are unused on an untextured asset and `optimize`'s prune pass is
    right to drop them. That is reported, not gated.

5.  **The building is where it was** (absolute). The world-space bounding box of the
    two files must agree to within FOUR RUNGS of the asset's own widest extent, where
    a rung is `extent / 65535` — the 16-bit lattice a normalised SHORT position is
    stored on, whatever bit depth the bake asked the quantiser for. The bound is a
    lattice, not a millimetre count, because the assets differ in size by three orders
    of magnitude: measured 2026-08-16, the worst was 2.63 rungs (0.107 mm on a 2.7 m
    shed) and the terrain's 82.8 mm is 1.08 rungs of its own 5,020 m box — the same
    quantity R-W6 committed as a 76.6 mm lattice. A building collapsed to a two-metre
    box is thousands of rungs, not four.

6.  **The derivative is never bigger than the master** (absolute, K37). `meshopt`
    writes a compression header, a buffer-view table and an index buffer, and on a
    small enough mesh those cost more than they save: the 90 flagged placeholders
    come out **+107,328 bytes (+20.6 %)** when this step is run over them, 88 of the
    90 growing. K36(a) read that as an anomaly and K36(b)'s control read it as a
    non-reproduction; both were describing the same thing and neither was a rule.
    The rule is a measurement, and it is **not** a property of the asset's kind —
    three assets that have always been compressed here shipped *larger* than their
    masters until this assertion was written, and two of the ninety placeholders
    compress 9.3 % *smaller*. `tools/web_derivatives.sh` now keeps whichever file is
    smaller, per asset, and this says what arrived. **The two epoch meshes are
    excluded by name**: their bit depth is a geometric decision (R-W6, and the ground
    and waterline are what R-BUG3c, R-BUG4 and R-M1a measure against), R-W6(b) is
    holding both files, and `water__` is +744 bytes under this rule — recorded, not
    silently applied.

7.  **Material identity** (RATCHET, `tools/web_derivative_baseline.json`). The shipped
    file should resolve to the same material NAMES and base COLOURS as its master and
    should gain no texture the master does not have. 38 of 334 assets failed this when
    the assertion was written — `optimize`'s palette pass folded their five or six named
    materials — `log`, `chinking`, `board`, `roof`, … — into a single
    `PaletteMaterial001` carrying two generated PNGs. **K36(b) repaired all 38 and
    rebanked the baseline empty, so it is 334 of 334 today and the ratchet holds
    nothing.** It stays a ratchet rather than an absolute because the repair moves 334
    binary files and a permanently red dev gate would block every unrelated parcel
    behind it. A new offender fails. A repaired one fails too, and says to bank it.

8.  **The passthrough set is decided, not discovered** (absolute in BOTH directions,
    `tools/web_derivative_baseline.json`, K38). 93 of the 334 derivatives are
    byte-identical to their masters, because compressing them makes them bigger and
    `tools/web_derivatives.sh` keeps the smaller file (K37). Every one of those is a
    decision. **A 94th is not** — and until this assertion existed, nothing could tell
    the two apart, because a master copied over its own derivative satisfies assertions
    1 through 7 by construction: same triangles, same node identity, same attributes,
    zero rungs of bounding-box drift, identical materials, and a byte count that is
    equal rather than larger. Measured (K38): two masters copied through by
    `tools/publish.sh` added **1,212,760 bytes** to the payload and `tools/check.sh`
    printed **CHECK PASS**. `assets/web/` has three writers — this step,
    `generators/inferred_placeholder.py` and, until K38, `tools/publish.sh` — and the
    gate on a directory's contents is a gate on its last writer only. So the set is
    banked by name and both directions fail: an unbanked passthrough is a writer nobody
    watched, and a banked one that is now compressed is a repair that has to be recorded
    with `--write-baseline` rather than discovered.

9.  **The derivative records the master it was made from** (absolute in BOTH
    directions, `assets/manifest.web.json`, K39). Assertions 1-8 compare a derivative
    to *whatever master sits beside it today*. None of them asks whether that is the
    master it came from, and nothing else did either: K38 left `tools/publish.sh`
    refusing on **mtime**, and measured that on a fresh clone `git checkout`'s own
    write order makes 334 of 334 masters older than their derivatives — so the scan is
    silent on exactly the tree a steward run starts from. The gap that survived is
    narrow and named. A master rebuilt into a *different building* fails assertions
    2-5; a master rebuilt into the **same** geometry with different `_CONFIDENCE`
    values fails nothing at all. That is the failure `publish.sh`'s original comment
    was written about — *"a rebuilt building kept rendering with its old confidence
    values"* — and `_CONFIDENCE` is how a visitor is told which parts we made up, so a
    stale one is a provenance fault wearing a rendering fault's clothes.

    `tools/web_derivatives.sh` knows exactly which master it compressed. It now writes
    `name -> sha256(master)` as it produces each derivative, into a sidecar that
    travels with the artefact, and this asserts it: a derivative whose recorded hash is
    not its master's hash today is stale ABSOLUTELY, whatever the timestamps say, and a
    derivative with no record at all is a file no step in this repository claims to
    have produced. The remedy in both directions is a REGENERATION, never an edit of
    the record — which is why the record has no `--write` affordance here on purpose. A
    hash map you can rewrite to make a gate green is a hash map that says nothing.

    **What it does not answer, stated because measuring it is what opened K40.** The
    hash names the MASTER, not the STEP. A derivative produced by an older flag set
    from this same master carries the right hash and still reproduces nothing:
    measured on a 20-asset spread sample, **14 of 20 shipped derivatives cannot be
    reproduced by `tools/web_derivatives.sh` as it stands today** — they carry FEWER
    vertices than their masters, because the palette pass K36(b) turned off was welding
    them as a side effect nobody had measured. Assertion 9 is silent on all 14, and
    correctly so: their master is the right master.
