/**
 * measure_picket_reading.mjs — does the fort's stockade READ as posts, from the
 * stands a visitor actually occupies?
 *
 *   PW_EXECUTABLE=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome \
 *     node tools/measure_picket_reading.mjs [--source] [--out DIR] [--json]
 *
 * ## The question, and why it needs its own instrument
 *
 * T-0185 is the one thing `p4_0` — the only picture anyone has of this fort —
 * says about the pickets that the model contradicts: the plate resolves separate
 * posts at a **10 px pitch on a 43 px wall**, 0.23 of the wall's height per post,
 * where the record builds `picket_spacing_m` 0.30 on a 3.7 m wall, **0.081**.
 * Nearly three times finer.
 *
 * `tools/measure_picket_plate.py` answers the first half of that — whether the
 * plate's pitch is a reading of the fort or the floor of its own medium — by
 * measuring what the plate could physically hold. It could not hold this wall:
 * the model's rhythm at the plate's own scale is 2.78 px of post and **0.70 px
 * of gap**, and the narrowest gap that plate draws anywhere on the curtain is
 * 2 px.
 *
 * This file answers the second half, which is a question about the model and not
 * about the plate: **at the distances a visitor stands, does the wall read as
 * posts or as a slab?** A lithograph has ONE viewing distance and a walkable
 * reconstruction has all of them, so the two media cannot be held to one answer —
 * and that asymmetry is only an argument once somebody measures both sides of it
 * in the same unit. The unit is pixels of drawn pitch.
 *
 * ## The method — the SAME statistic, on the other picture
 *
 * `measure_picket_plate.py` reads the plate's rhythm by autocorrelating the
 * curtain's column-mean darkness and by measuring the run lengths of its dark
 * strokes and pale gaps. This file does exactly that to a RENDER of the same
 * wall, from the same stand, so the two readings are the same quantity in the
 * same unit and can be put beside each other. The statistic is restated here in
 * JavaScript rather than shared, because the shot has to be taken in a browser
 * and a ten-line autocorrelation is a smaller cost than a pipe between two
 * runtimes.
 *
 * **Lags under 3 px are excluded and that is not tuning.** Any rendered image is
 * smooth at the pixel scale — multisampling guarantees it — so the correlation of
 * a frame with itself shifted one or two pixels is high whatever is drawn in it.
 * A rhythm is only RESOLVED if it correlates at a lag the eye could separate, so
 * the peak is searched from 3 px up. A wall whose only peak is at 2 px has not
 * failed to be measured: it has stopped reading as posts, which is the finding.
 *
 * Read against two thresholds, both stated before the reading:
 *
 *   * **a peak at 3 px or more, carrying its own harmonic** — a real picket line
 *     correlates again at twice its pitch and a shading gradient does not. That
 *     is what "reads as posts" means here.
 *   * **1 px of gap** — below it the space BETWEEN posts is never a whole pixel
 *     of background and the rhythm survives only as a shade, which is exactly
 *     the bind `p4_0`'s draughtsman was in at 0.70 px.
 *
 * ## The stands, and the rectangles
 *
 * `p4_0`'s own stand is the one `docs/RESEARCH/fort_dearborn_image_accuracy.md`
 * records for the plate comparison — local 1145, 300, yaw 180, on the north bank
 * looking south at the fort. `north_wall` is where a visitor ends up: outside the
 * north curtain by the gate, at the range the sawtooth was built to read at. Both
 * viewports are the release pair, and the phone one is booted with `hasTouch` so
 * it gets the renderer a phone gets rather than a narrow desktop window.
 *
 * The crop rectangles below were read off the shots by eye and are stated rather
 * than buried, the same bargain and for the same reason as the plate constants in
 * `measure_picket_plate.py`. They hold because the stands and the viewports are
 * fixed; the run writes the shot it read beside the number, so a rectangle that
 * has drifted off the wall is visible rather than silent.
 *
 * A reading, not a gate. Nothing here holds a build red; `measure_picket_plate.py
 * --gate` is the ratchet on this stockade and it guards the head, not the rhythm.
