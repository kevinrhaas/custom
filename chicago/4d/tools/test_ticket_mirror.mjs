/**
 * test_ticket_mirror.mjs — closing a ticket does not leave the published mirror
 * stale, AND the gate that catches a genuinely stale mirror still catches one.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (T-0154). `site/chicago/4d/tickets.json` is a verbatim copy of
 * `tickets/tickets.json`, and `tools/check_published.mjs` compares the two byte
 * for byte. `ticket.mjs done` rewrites the source. So the order AGENTS.md states
 * — publish in the same commit, then push, then close the ticket in the merging
 * PR with the number that push just produced — ended red every single time, and
 * what actually held it together was a REMEMBERED extra `publish.sh` after the
 * close. That is the kind of unwritten step that goes wrong at 3am, and it did:
 * T-0153/PR #318, gate red at 05:11Z on exactly this.
 *
 * The fix is that the writer of the file maintains its mirror. The DANGER in that
 * fix is obvious and the ticket's acceptance names it: a tool that refreshes the
 * mirror whenever it runs would launder a genuinely stale mirror, and the fault
 * class this gate exists for (#145, three parcels) would be invisible again. So
 * this file asserts BOTH halves, and the second one is the important one.
 *
 * EVERYTHING RUNS IN A SANDBOX. The tools resolve their paths from their own
 * location, so a temporary tree of the shape they expect — `<tmp>/chicago/4d/…`
 * beside `<tmp>/site/chicago/4d/` — gives them a whole world to be wrong in
 * without touching the repository. An earlier draft of this test mutated the real
 * tickets.json and restored it afterwards; a crash in the middle of that leaves a
 * working tree nobody can explain, which is not a thing to build a gate on.
