"""The platted street corridors, as one question asked in one place.

ROADMAP K7 phase two (a). The grid report found buildings standing in the road; the
generator that put them there had never asked. Both sides now read this module, so the
gate and the report cannot answer differently — which is the same reason
`generators/mesh_inputs.py` exists for the staleness hash.

What a corridor IS here: a committed street centreline from `data/streets/1835.json`,
offset both ways by half the platted module in `data/traces/street_control.json`. It is
therefore only as long as the centreline this project has drawn, and a building beyond a
street's drawn end is not in it. The geometry is `generate_plat_lots.corridor_rings` —
imported rather than copied.

What a corridor IS NOT: the travelled way. L79 records that the visible tracks run
5.8-10.5 m inside an 80 ft legal corridor, so a building inside the corridor is not
necessarily a building in anybody's way. That is exactly why this module reports a DEPTH
and lets each caller set its own bar: an invented placement has no business in the
roadway at all, while an attested frontage that lands a few metres inside it is a
measurement about the georeference and about the plat, not a defect in the record.

    T-0009, and the owner's ruling of 2026-08-29 that produced it: *"derive the platted
    corridor from the street CONTROL rather than from the drawn line."*

    A drawn centreline in `data/streets/1835.json` is a reconstruction decision about where
    a street can be DRAWN — south_water's own record says its line east of Franklin "is
    shifted into the dry half of the platted riverfront corridor", 8.28 m perpendicular off
    `control.south_water_franklin`. That shift is not a claim about where the platted
    corridor was, so measuring building bodies against the drawn line reported them
    intruding into a corridor the plat does not put there.

    So the corridor is centred on the control where a street HAS committed control. Per
    street this returns every control point naming it, the cross-axis offset from the drawn
    line to that point, and the verdict:

    * `centred`   — the line reproduces its control to under `QUOTED_M`. Nothing moves.
    * `recentred` — one agreed offset, larger than `QUOTED_M`. The corridor is translated
                    onto the control by it; the drawn line does NOT move.
    * `disagree`  — two or more control points that do not agree on one offset. A rigid
                    translation cannot satisfy them and re-DRAWING the line is exactly what
                    the ruling forbids, so the corridor stays on the drawn line and the
                    spread is recorded rather than averaged away.
    * `off_line`  — the control point lies beyond the drawn centreline's own span.

    The verdict is computed from the committed control and the committed lines every time.
    There is no list of street ids anywhere in it: a street acquires or loses a re-centring
    by what its control says, which is the whole point of deriving it.
