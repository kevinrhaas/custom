"""The written ruling on all 1,572 land-sale purchaser units (T-1296).

    python3 tools/spend_land_sales_rulings.py            write the ruling register
    python3 tools/spend_land_sales_rulings.py --check    it re-derives; nothing drifted
    python3 tools/spend_land_sales_rulings.py --self-test the rules below, held over what
                                                         they derive

WHY THIS EXISTS. T-1234 gave the research-spend ledger a place to write a ruling down:
`data/research/spend_rulings.json`, consulted only where a reading's own dispositions run
out, a named rule with a stated reason and a note on every single unit it closes. That
file is HAND-AUTHORED and holds 87 rulings. This corpus is 1,572 rows of one register,
and typing 1,572 notes by hand would be a worse register, not a better one: the notes
would drift, and nobody could prove the ruling matched the row it claims to rule.

So this register is DERIVED, from the two files that already carry the judgement:

    data/research/land_sales/records/*.json          the register as read (T-0636)
    data/research/land_sales/resident_crosswalk.json the identities, ADJUDICATED under
                                                     T-0700 / T-0850

and `--check` re-derives it. Nothing here re-adjudicates an identity, moves a grade,
mints a person or writes to data/residents/. Every note is built out of the row's own
fields — its purchase number, its date, its Residence column, its tract — so a reader can
put the note beside the row and see that it says what the row says.

THE STANDING RULE THIS DOMAIN WAS READ UNDER, and the one every ruling below obeys: a
purchase is a TRANSACTION and not a RESIDENCE. The register's own Residence column is the
only thing on the page that speaks to residence at all, and it reads COOK, ILLINOIS, some
other county, or UNKNOWN — a county, a state, or nothing, and never a town. A row can
bound a presence. It can never assert one.
