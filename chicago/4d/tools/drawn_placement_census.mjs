/**
 * drawn_placement_census.mjs — ROADMAP K50's census, in one place.
 *
 * A function, and nothing else: `tools/measure_drawn_placement.mjs` runs it as
 * an instrument and `tools/smoke_renderer.mjs` runs it as a release gate, and
 * they run THE SAME CODE rather than two readings of the same idea. That is not
 * tidiness — R-BUG5's own box records `measure_far_timber.py` and the browser
 * disagreeing until they were made to agree sample for sample, and a gate that
 * paraphrases its instrument is a gate that can pass a build the instrument
 * fails.
 *
 * It is serialised into the page with `CENSUS.toString()`, so it may close over
 * NOTHING from this module: everything it needs comes off `window.__chicago4d`.

/**
 * THE NEGATIVE CONTROL — put R-BUG5b's fault into the live scene.
 *
 * R-A1's finding, one parcel on: *an assertion that can only ever see one value
 * is not an assertion*. A placement gate that has only ever run on a correct
 * build has demonstrated nothing, and this project has shipped two gates that
 * were green because they were pointed at the wrong population rather than
 * because the town was right.
 *
 * So this reproduces the exact fault, in the exact terms it had: hand the ENU
 * northing to the slot that wants a three world z. For a building that is the
 * sign of its instance matrix's z translation; for the road ribbon it is the
 * sign of every drawn vertex's z. Nothing else is touched, and nothing here
 * runs outside `--refute`.
 *
 * It mutates the page it is called in. Run the real census FIRST.
