"""Generate the building material stacked on the lots that were going up — T-0057.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT IS A SECOND RECORD RATHER THAN A COLUMN ON THE FIRST.
`data/sources/chicago_democrat_1833_11_26.json` carries the village ordinances of
7 November 1833 complete, and **Ordinance 9 is about timber, stone, brick, boxes and
barrels stacked in the streets**. T-0040 drew the boxes and barrels — a merchant's stock
standing on his own frontage, `tools/generate_yard_goods.py` — and refused the other
three nouns in writing, because they are a different claim about a different kind of
ground: *timber, stone and brick are building material on a lot that is going up*, and
`data/yard/town_trade_goods.json` has no way to say which lot was building.

So the whole of this generator is one question, asked of the committed records rather
than of a taste: **which buildings does this dataset SAY were under construction on
1835-07-01?**

THE ANSWER, AND IT IS ONE. Of 343 structures standing on the scene date, 256 are
anonymous infill and 87 are named. Exactly one record states a construction state, and
states it `attested`: `lake_house_construction`, whose `function` is
`hotel_under_construction` off Andreas — 'the hotel was completed and thrown open to the
public in the autumn of 1836' — and whose `roof_type` is `none` for the same reason.
J. D. Bonnell, walking the town on 25 August 1835, saw 'the Lake House IN COURSE OF
CONSTRUCTION'; Harriet Martineau in June 1836 still called it 'a new hotel then
building'. It is the only building site this project can name, and it is a good one.

THE RULE. A lot gets building material iff

  1. it is a NAMED record — the id does not begin `inf_` or `recon_`. The 262 anonymous
     infill records carry a `documented_range.from` that is a PROGRAMME date and not a
     construction date, and `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L126 says so; reading one as a start of
     works would put a builder's yard on two hundred and fifty invented lots, which is
     the exact trap T-0057 was opened to avoid;
  2. its own record STATES the construction state — `attributes.function.value` ends
     `_under_construction`. NOT a date test. A `documented_range.from` inside 1835 is a
     first-attestation date for most of the records that carry one (a newspaper's first
     issue, a directory entry, a deed), and fourteen named records carry one; treating
     that as a groundbreaking would deal stacks of brick to a boarding house that had
     been standing for a year. They are refused here by name and with the reason;
  3. that function is `attested` or `inferred`, never `reconstructed` — the same clause
     the goods keep, for the same reason: invention squared;
  4. it is standing on the scene date (it is in `data/sidecars/1835/index.json`) and it
     is PLACED, with a committed footprint;
  5. nothing stands inside another building's committed footprint. Same clause 6 as the
     goods, and it is checked the same way.

WHICH MATERIALS, and this is dealt from the record and not from the ordinance's list in
order. Ordinance 9 names timber, stone and brick; what stands on a particular lot is what
that building is being built OF, as its own record states it:

  * BRICK because `construction` is `brick`, `attested`, in Andreas's own words — 'this
    hotel, which was built of brick, was three stories and a basement in height'. It is
    the one thing about this structure's fabric that is documented, and Blodgett's
    brickyard had been going on the North Side since the spring of 1833
    (`brickyard_north_side`), so the brick had somewhere to come from.
  * STONE because Andreas gives the building a BASEMENT in the same sentence, and a
    basement is masonry footing before it is anything else. `stories` on the record is a
    part-raised basement plus a first storey, which is precisely the stage of work a heap
    of footing stone belongs to.
  * TIMBER because a three-storey brick building of the period is floored, joisted and
    roofed in it, and is laid from timber scaffolding. Martineau, in the unfinished
    building in June 1836, was seated on 'a few chairs, and benches, and planks laid on
    trestles'.

WHERE, and the strip is a rule too. Material stands in a WORKING STRIP that runs round
the lot clear of the wall, dealt one material to a face beginning at the face the record
fronts and going round it, brick first because brick is the only fabric this record
attests and the front is where a visitor arrives. How many piles a face holds is
arithmetic on that face's run, capped per material. Nothing is placed by hand.

WHAT THIS RECORD DOES NOT CLAIM. It does not say material stood in the STREET, which is
the nuisance the ordinance actually legislated against: the street line at this site is
not resolved to better than the record's own 20 m position uncertainty, and drawing a
stack of brick into a traced roadway would be claiming a precision nobody has. It does
not date the delivery, it does not say how much material was on the ground, and it does
not draw a single brick — no source in this repository gives a brick or a course
dimension (`generators/common/materials.py`, substrate `brick`), so a stack is drawn as
stacked BLOCK and the courses are left out rather than invented at a modern module.
