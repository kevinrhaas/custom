"""The four directory crosswalks, SPENT on the people of 1835 (T-0632).

    python3 tools/spend_directories.py --check    everything re-derives; nothing has drifted
    python3 tools/spend_directories.py --report   person by person, what each volume carries
    python3 tools/spend_directories.py --self-test the four rules below, held over what it derives

WHY THIS EXISTS, and what it replaces. T-0555, T-0571, T-0506 and T-0587 read three
Chicago directories and adjudicated them against this town: Fergus 1839, Fergus 1843,
Norris 1844 and Norris's advertising cards of 1844. Between them they matched 214
entries to people this reconstruction holds, and every one of those match rows carries
`occupation_1835: "none_recorded"` and `lives_at_1835: null` on the resident side. The
adjudication happened and nothing crossed into the town. `tools/spend_norris_1844.py`
spent ONE of the four; this pass subsumes it and spends the rest.

THE THREE THINGS IT WRITES, and why they are three.

  data/residents/directories.json   THE LAYER A VISITOR SEES. One row per person, every
        volume that meets them, every entry as printed, and what the entry holds that
        the 1835 record does not. Beside the records rather than inside them for the
        reason T-0569 set out: a directory listing is EVIDENCE ABOUT ITS OWN YEAR
        offered beside a person of 1835, not a fact of theirs, and keeping it beside
        the record is what stops it reading as one.

  data/research/directories/spend_crosswalk_1835.json   THE LEDGER. One ruling per
        (person, volume): what the volume prints, what this pass CARRIED to the card
        and what it REFUSED to carry, with the claim ids it rests on and the source it
        rests on. It is a crosswalk because it is an adjudication — the decision that a
        printed line may or may not cross to a person as later evidence — and putting
        it anywhere else would hide it from `tools/measure_research_spend.py`, which is
        the instrument that reported this domain as 6,684 read and 288 spent.

  data/residents/households/*.json  THE CARD. A `directories` block on the household,
        carrying the later occupation and the later address as graded values and
        CITING THE SOURCE. This is the hop the owner asked about on 2026-09-03 — "there
        are not outputs or updates to the household and resident data" — and it is the
        only one of the three a reader of a single record can see.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT CARRIED — the whole provenance argument, in four rules.

  1. NOTHING IS CARRIED THAT THE CROSSWALK DOES NOT ALREADY DECLARE. Each match row
     holds a `could_carry` list its own adjudication wrote. This pass reads that list
     and carries exactly what is in it. It never re-parses a printed line, never
     decides for itself that an entry holds a trade, and is therefore reversible from
     the crosswalk in both directions.

  2. ONLY A SINGLE-ENTRY MATCH CARRIES ANYTHING. A person met by several entries is
     AMBIGUOUS and every candidate is shown rather than one chosen; an entry met by two
     people is CONTESTED and at most one of them is the person printed. Both are
     rendered — hiding them would report the crosswalks' successes and their arithmetic
     separately — and neither writes a value onto a card.

  3. A SPLIT IS REFUSED PER ENTRY AND PER FIELD, never per volume. What T-0569 refused
     in Norris's alphabetical volume is a SHAPE: the volume sets a partnership where the
     trade would go — "of Horace Norton & Co", "of Loyd", twice simply "of" — so the
     split yields a value containing no trade at all, and printing one on a card would
     launder a heuristic into a finding. That ground is a fact about one printed line,
     so it is asked of one printed line: `split_refusal` below names the clause a field
     is refused under and says nothing about the field beside it or the volume around
     it. A refused field's LINE is still carried whole and quoted; only its parse stops.

  4. NO 1835 GRADE MOVES, EVER. Under the ratified ladder a directory of 1839, 1843 or
     1844 never makes an 1835 resident, never dates one and never gives one a trade in
     1835. Every value this pass writes is graded `attested` FOR ITS OWN YEAR, carries
     `describes_date`, and says in its own note that the 1835 record is untouched. The
     count of 1835 grades changed by this pass is zero, and `--check` holds it there.

THE STREET NUMBER DOES NOT CROSS EITHER. Fergus 1839 flags the entries whose address is
a street number in the 1839 grid (`address_is_street_only`), a numbering this town's
year does not have; for those the STREET NAME crosses and the number is dropped, which
is the rule the 1839 crosswalk wrote for itself.

# WHY THE CARD NAMES THE ENTRY IDS (T-0989, spent by T-0987). A ruling in a generated
# crosswalk states no source of its own: the file says once, at the top, which volume it
# rests on, and every ruling in it shares that one id. `tools/measure_research_spend.py`
# therefore judges such a ruling written only if the card ALSO names the unit adjudicated
# — and until this line was added not one of the 263 matches these four crosswalks make
# did. The instance the ticket checked by hand: `hh_garrett_a` cites
# `fergus_chicago_directory_1839` because this pass writes the volume into `sources`,
# while Fergus 1839's ruling for Garrett — entry f1839_e0527 — was nowhere on the record.
# The citation was doing the work of a reading.
#
# So the block's own note ends by naming, per person and per volume, the printed entries
# this pass ruled onto this household and the status it ruled them at. It goes in the
# NOTE rather than in a new leaf deliberately: the note is already rendered whole by
# `renderers/web/js/residents.js` and already declared `shown` in
# `tools/measure_layer_reads.py`, so the entry a reader would have to go back to arrives
# in front of that reader instead of into a field nothing opens. It is also the only
# place that can speak for the 92 people this pass rules on and carries nothing for —
# an ambiguous or contested match writes no graded value, and before this the card said
# of them only that some volume had met somebody of the name.
