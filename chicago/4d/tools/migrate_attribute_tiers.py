WHAT THIS IS FOR.

The owner, 2026-09-17: *"note for each attribute of each person what is attested,
inferred or reconstructed and reasons why."* The layer already grades a PERSON
(`grade`, the ladder rung) and it already puts a `confidence` on an attribute. What
it could not say is which of the three tiers a given attribute STANDS ON once the
reconstruction bands start filling attributes in — because `confidence:
"reconstructed"` is already spoken for, and it means the opposite of what the tier
will mean.

THE COLLISION, AND HOW IT IS RESOLVED. 7,314 claim blocks in the household cards
carry `confidence: "reconstructed"` over a value that asserts NOTHING — 6,160 with
`value: null` and a note reading "Not attested.", and 1,154 occupations whose value
is the sentinel `none_recorded`. That is not an invented value; it is the absence of
one, written down. Once a band actually invents a value, `reconstructed` has to mean
the invention, so the two readings cannot share a word.

So a fourth tier is added — `unknown`, meaning *nothing is asserted yet* — and the
migration below reads every not-asserted `reconstructed` block as `unknown`. What is
left under `reconstructed` is 40 blocks across the whole layer: twelve conjectured
arrival years, origins and presences, and twenty-eight addresses back-projected from
a later directory. Those are real reconstructions and they are the ones that now owe
a `basis` and a `replaceable_by`.

THE SHAPE (additive — no existing field moves, and `confidence` is untouched):

    {"value": "1826", "confidence": "reconstructed", "tier": "reconstructed",
     "note": "...",
     "basis": {"kind": "rule", "id": "arrival_conjecture", "note": "..."},
     "seed": "<deterministic seed>",              # kind "model" only
     "replaceable_by": {"kind": "person", "match": "..."}}

`tier` is DERIVED from `confidence` and the value and may not disagree with that
derivation — `validate.py` refuses the disagreement, which is what stops a tier being
quietly promoted above the evidence its own confidence admits to.

WHY THE EXISTING LAYER'S TIERS ARE DERIVED RATHER THAN WRITTEN INTO THE CARDS, which
is the one design decision here worth arguing with. The obvious move is to write `tier`
into all 1,258 household records, and it was tried first. It cannot stand: those bytes
are owned by NINE derivations that each rebuild a card from its sources and compare the
result to the committed file —

    synthesize_resident_research.py --drift    mint_documented_residents.py --check
    mint_civic_residents.py --check            mint_placed_residents.py --check
    back_project_addresses.py --check          back_project_residences.py --check
    qualify_later_trades.py --check            survey_stated_kin.py --write
    the four directory crosswalks

— and none of them knows the field exists, so ten of `check.sh`'s steps go red the
moment a tier lands in a card, and stay red until every writer emits one. Teaching nine
writers is real work and it belongs with T-1144's convergence pass, which owns the
drift in that layer. A field nine writers silently drop is a field that lies.

So the tier of an EXISTING value is derived, here and in `attribute-tiers.js`, from the
provenance the card already carries, and the derivation is published as a table. What a
record MAY carry, and what `validate.py` refuses if it carries it wrongly, is the full
shape below — because the reconstruction bands (T-1167 onward) mint their own records
and need somewhere to write a tier, and a value invented without a basis and without a
seed has to be refusable at the moment it is written.

TWO RULES THAT ARE NOT OBVIOUS, AND ARE THE POINT.

  * A `reconstructed` value owes a BASIS of one of two kinds, and they carry
    different evidence. `kind: "model"` was DRAWN — from a population, household or
    occupation model — so it owes the `seed` that redraws it; a drawn value nobody can
    redraw is not reproducible and this project does not ship one. `kind: "rule"` was
    ARGUED — the earliest year the evidence forces, an address carried back from an
    1843 directory — so it owes the rule's id and the reasoning, and it has no seed,
    because nothing was drawn. Requiring a seed of an argued value would mean
    inventing one, which is the failure this whole file exists to prevent.
  * EVERY RECONSTRUCTED VALUE SAYS WHAT WOULD RETIRE IT. The owner: *"so if we get
    new research … we can replace the reconstructed person or business with an
    inferred or attested one later."* `replaceable_by.match` is not a guess about the
    future; it is the definition of the attribute read back as a search — what
    retires a reconstructed arrival is a source that dates the arrival. The table
    below is that reading, one row an attribute, and it is why the migration can
    write the field without inventing anything.

RUN `--build` AFTER ANY WRITER. The table counts the committed cards, so a pass that
changes one changes the table; `--check` is wired into `check.sh` and goes red when the
two part company, which is the intended way to find out.
