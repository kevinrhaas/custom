"""Derive the School Section's block grid, its twelve east-west streets and its three
reservations from J. S. Wright's 1834 survey, read on the National Archives / Historic
Urban Plans reproduction registered by T-0787.

The section is the mile square of Section 16, T39N R14E — the school section the state
sold in October 1833 — bounded by Madison Street on the north, State Street on the east
and, a mile from each, the lines that later carried Twelfth Street and Halsted Street.
Wright draws it whole, ruled into a grid and numbered, and this project has never held
any of it: no block, no street, and no ground for the 125 land-sale rows that name its
block numbers.

METHOD, and it is a MEASUREMENT off the sheet rather than a re-use of Thompson's module.

  1. The scan is resampled into scene coordinates (local ENU metres, EPSG:26916 through
     data/datum.json) using the affine in data/traces/gcp/wright_1834_nara_hup_gcps.json.
     That deskews the drawing: the plat's own north-south and east-west rules become the
     axes of the sampled raster, so a ruled line is a peak in a one-dimensional darkness
     profile and nothing has to be traced by hand.
  2. Every line of the grid was picked as the centroid of that peak, in six independent
     bands along its length, and the median taken. Where a street is drawn as a pair of
     rules the pair gives the corridor its drawn width; where the draughtsman drew one
     line the width is not recoverable from the sheet and the platted standard is used.
  3. The measured line table is then anchored on the section itself. Madison and State
     cross at a PLSS section corner — sections 9/10/15/16 — which is GCP G1 of the
     registration, and the section is a statute mile on a side. The measured interior
     lines are rescaled linearly onto that exact square. Residuals are reported below
     and in docs/RESEARCH/school_section_grid_1834.md.

WHAT IS MEASURED AND WHAT IS ADOPTED. The measured east-west span of the grid falls 6.3 m
SHORT of the statute mile, four tenths of one per cent; the measured north-south span
overruns it by 49.3 m, three per cent. That asymmetry is the registration's own finding
showing at the bottom of the sheet: it measured 5.2 per cent x/y anisotropy on this scan
against 3.7 per cent on the BPL copy, and the extra stretch is in the long axis, along
which the manuscript was torn and backed. The section is a mile on the ground whatever
the paper does, so the grid is anchored on the section and not on the paper.

# THE MEASUREMENT. Line centres are metres in the resampled (deskewed) frame, before the
# section anchor is applied. `drawn_w` is the separation of the pair of rules where the
# sheet draws the corridor with two, and None where it draws a single line — the widths
# of those are not on the sheet. `bands` is how many of the six sampling bands agreed.
# Sheet names are the draughtsman's, read off the same raster.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE NORTH-SOUTH LINES — T-0877. Wright rules fourteen of them across the section and
# letters seven; the outermost two are the section's own boundaries and the eastern of
# those is State Street.
#
# WHETHER THESE ARE THE TOWN'S STREETS CONTINUED OR RECORDS OF THEIR OWN is the decision
# the ticket asked for, and it is SEPARATE RECORDS. Three reasons, in the order they bind:
#
#   1. GEOMETRY. `canal`, `clinton`, `market`, `wells`, `clark` and `state` are committed
#      no further south than local N -400 m, and Madison — this section's north line and
#      the Town of Chicago's south boundary — is at -534. A continuation would have to
#      draw the 134 m between them. That ground is Wright's Washington-to-Madison tier,
#      which T-0858 has open and unread, and this project does not rule a line across
#      ground nobody has read.
#   2. STATUS. The town's own lines carry no `opened` flag: they are the worn streets of
#      the advertising town. These carry `opened: false`, `track_width_m: 0` and
#      "platted, unopened, unworn" — the owner's reading of this sheet, 2026-09-05. One
#      record cannot be both a worn street and an unopened survey line.
#   3. PRECEDENT. The file already holds `market`/`market_north`, `wells`/`wells_north`,
#      `clark`/`clark_north` and `dearborn`/`dearborn_north`: one printed name, one record
#      per survey. T-0451 seated the North Division that way for this same reason.
#
# AND THE CONSEQUENCE FOR THE REGISTER, which is the half of the question that bites.
# `compile_register.py` keys a printed street name onto ONE id, and its tie-break was "the
# record reaching furthest SOUTH takes the name" (T-0451, decided when the only rival was
# the North Division). These lines reach a mile further south than any street the town
# walked on, so seating them named would have handed every bare "Clark Street", "Wells
# Street", "Market Street", "Canal Street", "Clinton Street" and "State Street" in the
# newspapers and the directories to unopened prairie below Madison. That tie-break now
# reads the status first — an unopened survey line never takes a printed name from a
# street the town used — and the fix is committed with these records, not after them.
#
# `name_2026` is null on all of them, as it is on `market_north` and on the unnamed
# east-west tiers: the later names of these lines are not evidence about 1835, and this
# project has read no modern street layer south of Madison.
