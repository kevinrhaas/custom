WHAT THIS IS FOR.

T-1147 clause 7 widened a person's place from one roof to a LIST of dated,
tiered relationships, and `tools/associations.py` gave that list its shape and
its gate. What it did not do is fill it: four records carried rows and 2,265 did
not, because every row was hand-authored from a reading. This module fills it
from the four committed bodies of evidence that already say where people OTHER
THAN AT HOME were — and it fills it only that far.

  * the CIVIC SEAT of an office a man held      `roles[].kind == "office"`
  * the CHURCH a register names him at          `church_evidence[]`
  * an AGENCY he held                           `data/reconstruction/1835_agencies.json`
  * the GROUND he bought                        `data/research/land_sales/resident_crosswalk.json`
                                                `data/reconstruction/1835_land_sales_by_tract.json`
  * the SCHOOL he taught in                     `roles[].role == "schoolteacher"`

THE REFUSALS ARE THE FINDING, and they are counted beside the rows rather than
dropped. An office is not a seat: `civic_public_buildings_1835.md` § 4 is a
whole section on the public functions of Chicago that had no building of their
own, and three quarters of the offices this layer holds are in it. A relationship
with no place is not a row — `associations.py` says so in its own docstring — so
an office whose seat no source reached produces a REFUSAL with the sentence that
refused it, and never a row at a guessed address. The two numbers that matter
are therefore `rows` and `refusals`, and the second is the larger.

THE SEAT TABLE IS A READING AND IT IS WRITTEN DOWN. `CIVIC_SEATS` below is the
whole of what this module knows about where an office sat; every entry carries
the source that placed it, the rung the source's own words reach, and the note
that is copied onto the row. Nothing is placed by this module that is not in
that table, and adding to the table is a reading, not a refactor.

WHY THE POST OFFICE IS A FACE AND NOT A ROOF. The easy, wrong answer is
`hogan_store`: it held Chicago's first post office and the walkthrough anchors
`first_post_office` there. The store's own record refuses it — "NOT THE POST
OFFICE AT THE SCENE DATE, which is the fact this record exists to get right" —
because Andreas has the office removed about July 1834 to near the corner of
Franklin and South Water, "where it stayed through Hogan's term". So the row
reaches a corner and stops, and the word "near" is the source's own.

A FACE ID IS WRITTEN IN UNDERSCORES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE VIEW READS IT ALOUD.
`residents.js` prints `place_or_structure_id` through `words()`, which is
`replace(/_/g, ' ')` and nothing else — so `south_water_and_franklin_corner`
reaches a visitor as "south water and franklin corner" and any other punctuation
reaches them as punctuation. Every street token in a face id is a committed
corridor in `data/streets/1835.json`, and the self-test holds that.

THE ROWS GO ON PERSONS. The ticket's own scope is a person's other significant
locations, and the household is the wrong record for them: an office, a parish
act and a quarter-section are held by a man and not by a house. It is also what
keeps `singular_drift` out of the way — `lives_at`/`works_at` are household
fields, so a person's list cannot contradict a singular link it does not have.

WHAT IS PRESERVED. A record that already carries `associated_with` keeps every
row it has: this module appends by the (kind, place, from) key `associations.py`
already dedupes on, and reports what it found already held. The four
demonstration records T-1238 wrote by hand are not rewritten by a generator.
