"""The 1840 census heads, spent on the people they name (T-0698).

    python3 tools/spend_census_1840_heads.py             write the ledger and the cards
    python3 tools/spend_census_1840_heads.py --check     everything re-derives; nothing drifted
    python3 tools/spend_census_1840_heads.py --report    person by person, what the sheet says
    python3 tools/spend_census_1840_heads.py --self-test the rules below, held over what it derives

WHY THIS EXISTS. `data/research/census_1840/resident_crosswalk.json` adjudicates every
named head on the 1840 left sheets against the 1835 name pools, and its `matched` and
`candidate` rulings name a person this town holds a card for. Until this pass those
rulings lived only in the crosswalk. `tools/measure_research_spend.py`'s second hop is
the instrument that says so: a ruling naming a person whose CARD has not learned it is
counted `unwritten`, and the census_1840 ceiling on that hop is 0.

T-0670 found the shape of the problem from the other end. The crosswalk had gone stale —
declared against 849 residents and 17 sheets while the town held 1,404 and 25 — and
rebuilding it re-derived one more ruling than the domain had spent, so the gate failed
and the run reverted rather than rule. This pass is the ruling, generalised: whatever the
crosswalk reaches, the card is told.

WHAT THIS SOURCE IS, AND THE LIMIT THAT TRAVELS WITH IT. A head on an 1840 left sheet is
a name written down five years after the 1835-07-01 scene. The crosswalk states the limit
at the top of its own file — "LATER EVIDENCE ONLY… an 1839 or 1840 appearance alone is
never an 1835 resident, and 1840 household composition is never back-projected" — and
that sentence is quoted onto every card rather than paraphrased.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT WRITTEN, in four rules — the rules tools/spend_land_sales.py holds,
unchanged, because the defect they guard against is the same one.

  1. ONLY WHAT THE CROSSWALK ALREADY DECLARED. This pass re-adjudicates nothing. It reads
     the `matched` and `candidate` heads and writes those. The 761 refusals are rivals
     still standing and write nothing — a refusal is not a spend.

  2. TWO FIELDS AND NO OTHERS. A person gains the source id in `sources` and a paragraph
     in `note`. Nothing else is touched — not a grade, not an arrival, not a claim block,
     not a placement, and above all not `present_on_scene_date`. `--self-test` holds that
     by diffing a record through the applier and asserting the changed key set.

  3. NO GRADE MOVES, and a CANDIDATE SAYS SO IN ITS OWN PARAGRAPH. `matched` and
     `candidate` are different things and are written differently: a candidate's
     paragraph states, in its own words, that nothing independent of the name was found
     and that the project asserts no identity from it. Reading the two the same way is
     precisely what the crosswalk's ladder exists to prevent.

  4. ONE PARAGRAPH PER PERSON, NOT PER HEAD. A person the sheets carry twice is told
     once, in a paragraph naming every sheet, page and line behind the ruling.

THE LEDGER IS NOT A CROSSWALK, deliberately, and for the reason the earlier passes gave:
`data/research/census_1840/head_spend_1835.json` carries no "crosswalk" in its name so
that `measure_research_spend.py` does not read a record of WRITES as a second
adjudication and report the pass grading its own homework.
