/**
 * ROADMAP K49(a) — THE SWARD'S DRAWN CENSUS, ACROSS EVERY COMMUNITY.
 *
 *   node tools/measure_sward_draw.mjs [--source] [--gate] [--declare]
 *
 * `flora.js` keeps the census (`stats.draws`); the release smoke reads it at
 * whatever station the gate happens to be standing in, and that is one
 * community out of ten. This stands the placer in EVERY community in turn and
 * asks the same question of each: which species does a list owe a whole plant
 * to, and draw nowhere?
 *
 * Why a separate tool rather than another smoke assertion. The smoke is a gate
 * and costs ~13 minutes a viewport; this is a measurement and costs about one,
 * because it never renders a frame it does not need. It re-deals the sward by
 * handing `flora.update` a synthetic camera at a plantable point inside each
 * community — the same entry point the render loop uses, so it measures the
 * placer rather than a re-implementation of it.
 *
 * The single-station figure the smoke prints is not wrong, it is SMALL: 68
 * slots in the settled town, where this reports 6,780 across sixteen populated
 * lists. Quote this one for a claim about the dataset, and the smoke's for a
 * claim about the frame the gate stood in.
 *
 * Defaults to the PUBLISHED mirror, for the reason the smoke does: the source
 * tree and the site do not load the same geometry, and the ground a plant is
 * stationed on comes off it. `--source` measures the working tree instead.
 *
 * ROADMAP K54 — it also prints, per (community, list), the ground the drawn
 * plants cover against the ground their own records claim, and the deviation per
 * hundred slots so two draws of different sizes can be compared. The shrub
 * stratum is its own list here because it is its own lattice pass in the
 * renderer; before K54 its rows were inside `forb`.
 *
 * `SWARD_VIEWPORT=mobile` stands the run at a PHONE and not merely at a phone's
 * window (T-0162). The ring sizes a station deals over are cut from the sward
 * tune, and the tune is reached by the DEVICE guess — a coarse pointer, or a
 * touch point under a 900 px window — so a bare 390 px viewport resolved the
 * desktop tune and the two runs came back identical, row for row. The run now
 * prints the stand it reached (window, touch points, pointer, detail level, tune
 * and every layer's ring reach) before its first figure, and REFUSES to print a
 * census at all if the stand it reached is not the one that was asked for.
 *
 * T-0019 / ROADMAP K58 — it also prints what the FORB LATTICE'S CEILING costs each
 * community: the plants per m² its own records ask for, the 0.346 the lattice can
 * carry, and the share of its record the layer is therefore able to draw. Nine of
 * the ten populated forb layers sit on that ceiling. `--gate` asserts the set
 * against `tools/forb_clamp_baseline.json`, which is the declaration itself, and
 * `--declare` rewrites that file from the measurement.
 *
 * ROADMAP K49(f) — `--gate` exits non-zero when any list owes a species a WHOLE
 * slot and deals it none. The same assertion now runs inside
 * `tools/smoke_renderer.mjs`, which is where it belongs; this flag is here so
 * the question can be asked in a minute rather than in a smoke, because that is
 * the difference between a check an agent runs while iterating and one it runs
 * at the end. `tools/check.sh` cannot run either — the dev gate's runner has no
 * Playwright, by design (it is the fast half of the two-speed build).

/**
 * `forbShareOf` is `min(1, density x cell^2 / perCell)`, and that `min` is a
 * lattice ceiling of one plant per slot. Where a community's own records ask for
 * more plants per square metre than the lattice can carry, the clamp bites and
 * **the layer is drawn at a density `TUNE.forb` chose and not at one any record
 * states** — `z06_dense_forest` draws a fraction of its recorded cover for that
 * reason and not for want of research.
 *
 * The clamp was invisible from outside `flora.js`: a share reading 1.000 is one
 * plant per slot whatever the slot is, so a layer sitting ON the ceiling and one
 * tuned to it printed the same number. K55 took the count of clamped layers from
 * four to six and nothing said so; T-0034 raised the two prairies onto it and
 * nothing said that either.
 *
 * So this is the declaration T-0019's acceptance asks for. It states, per
 * community and per SIDE of the waterline, the plants per square metre the
 * records ask for, the ceiling, and the share of its own record the layer can
 * actually draw. It is not a fix: the ceiling stands, because raising it is
 * geometry in exactly the communities that already carry the most and the
 * project's triangle ceilings are the binding constraint (T-0223, T-0229).
 * What changes is that the debt is now a number this project prints rather than

/* ROADMAP K49(e) / T-0018 — DOES A SPATIAL FILTER EAT THE STRATIFICATION?     */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
/**
 * K49(d) finding 3 claimed that because the block permutation makes rank a
 * deterministic function of position, any filter applied AFTER the deal that is
 * itself a spatial rule selects a BIASED SET of ranks — so the surviving slots
 * no longer carry the stratification the deal built, and `deviation` reads
 * worse. K49(f) refuted it for the row it was mostly measured on (the fixed
 * grid's own bias explained 23.66 of `z10_settled_town`'s 24.87). What was left
 * for this parcel is the riverbank's residual and the general question.
 *
 * THE INSTRUMENT, and why it is this one. `deviation` is a functional of the
 * SURVIVORS' ranks alone, so the claim can be put exactly rather than
 * correlated: count each species' slots at the moment of the deal (`dealt`) as
 * well as after the filters (`drawn`), and split the survivors' disagreement
 * with the deal into two terms.
 *
 *   dealtDev  Σ|dealt_i − share_i·N|   the discrepancy the DEAL itself has,
 *                                      before any filter — the stratification
 *                                      the parcel is asking about
 *   B         Σ|drawn_i − q·dealt_i|   how far the survivors are from the filter
 *                                      having taken the SAME fraction q = m/N of
 *                                      every species. This is the selection term
 *                                      and it is zero for a perfectly even filter
 *
 * A filter that is blind to rank still moves B, because it is a subsample: it
 * moves it by sampling noise and no more. Under rank-neutral survivorship
 * drawn_i is hypergeometric, so
 *
 *   Bnull = Σ √(2/π) · √( m·p_i(1−p_i)·(N−m)/(N−1) ),   p_i = dealt_i/N
 *
 * is what B reads when the mechanism is ABSENT. **B/Bnull ≈ 1 refutes the
 * mechanism for that row; B/Bnull ≫ 1 proves it, and by how much.**
 *
 * Both controls are run below on the real dealt vectors, because an instrument
 * that has not been shown reading red is not evidence: the GREEN control draws
 * a genuinely uniform subsample of the same size, the RED control draws one of
 * the same size that rejects wide clumps preferentially — which is the rule
 * `crowdsTheWalker()` actually applies.
