"""Seat the Kinzie's Addition street module on the committed town grid.

    tools/seat_kinzie_addition_streets.py            print what it would write
    tools/seat_kinzie_addition_streets.py --write    write data/streets/1835.json

The reading is `data/traces/kinzie_addition_street_grid.json` and it is not
repeated here: this tool takes the MODULE out of that file — the tier pitch, the
column pitch, the corridor width and the extents — and lays it off the two
committed streets the Addition shares with the town, Michigan Street
(`michigan_north`) and Wolcott Street (`wolcott`).

WHY NOT JUST COMMIT THE PIXELS. Because the same street would then stand in two
places. Wright's Michigan Street, read through the NA sheet's own affine, lands
19.8 m south of `michigan_north`, and `michigan_north` is Wright's Michigan
Street. The 19.8 m is the fit's, not the plat's: 16.19 m of RMS residual on eight
control points, and a drawn bearing about 1.2 deg off the one the committed grid
takes from modern control over a baseline four times longer. So the sheet is
asked for what it measures well — the distance from one ruled line to the next,
inside one corner of one raster — and the committed grid is asked for where that
ladder hangs.

Every new line is therefore PARALLEL to the committed street of its own family
and OFFSET from it by a whole number of measured modules. Nothing here is fitted
to modern pavement and nothing is chosen to look right.

    "GEOMETRY: the plat's module is measured off the sheet by "
    "tools/read_kinzie_addition_streets.py and recorded in "
    "data/traces/kinzie_addition_street_grid.json — {pitch} m from one {fam} corridor to "
    "the next (sd {sd} m over {n} spacings), read as ink projected onto one axis, not "
    "picked by eye. The line itself is that module laid off {datum}, parallel to it, "
    "because the sheet's own fit puts Wright's Michigan Street 19.8 m south of "
    "`michigan_north`, which is the same street: the sheet measures the ladder and the "
    "committed grid holds it. CORRIDOR: {corr} m. That is not the raw read. The method "
    "reads the Original Town's platted 80 ft corridors on the same sheet at 83.6 ft "
    "(three readings, sd 5.2), and the Addition's corridors at 75.1 ft (24 readings, sd "
    "4.9); the Addition's are 0.898 of the Original Town's, which against a platted 80 ft "
    "is 71.9 ft. So Wright's drafting does say the Addition's streets are narrower than "
    "the town's, by about a tenth — and it does not resolve onto a round platted figure: "
    "66 ft is outside the reading and so is 80 ft. The deed of the Addition would settle "
    "it and is not in the corpus. STATUS follows `madison`'s: platted ground, not road. "
    "In 1835 this tract is a survey over prairie — `track_width_m` is 0 because no wagon "
    "track is drawn or attested on it, `alleys` is false because the sheet rules none "
    "inside these blocks, and the confidences say `inferred` for the same reason "
    "`madison` does: the line is read off Wright's sheet as a ruled line and anchored on "
    "committed control, not traced from a plat this project holds. EXTENT is the "
    "reading's, and it stops where the reading stops: Wright carries these streets east "
    "of Sand Street over the shore-cut blocks to the lake, and that reach waits on the "
    "shore trace (T-0799, T-0800); the river tier south of Michigan Street and its water "
    "lots wait on T-1063. T-1060, piece 1 of T-0789."
