"""Generate the goods standing at the town's trading frontages — the yard layer.

WHAT THIS IS. `docs/ROADMAP.md` K5 (c) asks for *"yard objects: wagons/drays …, crates
and barrels at the stores"*, and ticket T-0040 is that clause for the taverns and the
stores. Unlike the signboards one layer over, this one does not start from silence: the
town legislated about it.

THE EVIDENCE, AND IT IS AN ORDINANCE. `data/sources/chicago_democrat_1833_11_26.json`
carries the village ordinances of 7 November 1833 complete, and **Ordinance 9 is about
timber, stone, brick, boxes and barrels stacked in the streets**. A corporation does not
legislate against a thing nobody does. That is a tier-1 contemporary statement that
Chicago's streets in the town's own first winter had boxes and barrels standing in them,
made twenty months before the scene date and by the people who had to walk round them.

What the ordinance does NOT give is a single location. It says the town, not the corner.
So the shape of this record is the same as the pickets' and the signboards': the evidence
is a TREATMENT and the answer to "why this frontage" has to be a RULE.

THE RULE, and every clause is doing work. A frontage gets goods iff

  1. it is a NAMED record — the id does not begin `inf_` or `recon_` and the name does not
     begin "Reconstructed". The archetype tables' own rule is *never invent business, sign
     text or goods for an anonymous slot*, and it names goods explicitly;
  2. its `function` is a GOODS-KEEPING TRADE — one whose stock arrived in boxes and
     barrels off a lake schooner and stood on the ground before it went inside. The
     taverns and hotels are in for the reason the stores are: a public house takes its
     provisions in by the barrel and puts the empties back out. Smithies, tanneries,
     manufactories, stables, churches, schools, the court-house and the jail are out —
     they kept stuff, but not a merchant's stock on a public frontage;
  3. that function is `attested` or `inferred`. A `reconstructed` trade gets no goods,
     for the same reason it gets no sign: invention squared;
  4. it is standing on the scene date (it is in `data/sidecars/1835/index.json`);
  5. it stands on the TOWN's ground. The fort's provision store and the sutler's store
     are refused in writing: they are federal ground inside a palisade, outside the
     corporation whose ordinance is the whole evidence here, and there is no public
     street in front of either of them;
  6. the strip in front of its facade is clear — nothing is placed where it would stand
     inside another building's committed footprint.

WHERE THE GOODS STAND is then DERIVED, not placed, exactly as a board's anchor is.
`docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md` fixes the frame: polygon `u` → +X, polygon `v` → −Z, and
`rotation_deg` is the FACADE BEARING, so the front wall is the footprint's own max-`v`
edge. The goods stand against that wall, 0.55 m out from its plane, at the end of the
frontage the signboard does not occupy — `tools/generate_business_signboards.py` hangs
its board 1.7 m toward +u of the facade centre, so this piles the barrels from the −u end
and the door between them stays clear. How many is arithmetic on the frontage and not a
lottery: one barrel per 2.2 m of usable wall, capped at four, a crate past them once
there is 4 m of wall to hold one, and a second crate stacked on it at 7 m.

THE ATTESTED WAGON, and why it used to be the only one. No source in this repository puts
a wagon at any place in this town on any day. One place is named for them:
`data/enclosures/western_hotel_wagon_yard.json`, whose attested sentence is *"In the rear
was the large stable and the yard into which the trains were driven."* So a wagon stands
in the yard the source calls a wagon yard, at the point in it derived to be furthest from
every fence line and every committed wall. That wagon and the Green Tree's are the two
addresses evidence reaches, and until T-0064 they were the only wagons in Chicago.

THE TOWN'S OWN WAGONS (T-0064), AND THE RESTRAINT THAT WAS OVERRULED. This file used to
end the paragraph above with *"Scattering drays along Lake Street would be this record
inventing traffic"*, and the record's own research note filed the rest of a frontier
town's traffic as an open ticket. **The owner closed it, 2026-08-18, verbatim: "there can
be more wagons! of course there would be more wagons all over the place in a frontier
town."** His standing ruling of the same day covers the tier: *"you are totally fine to be
liberal with adding reconstructed items when i ask for things, you can just label and mark
them as such."* So the wagons are scattered now, every one of them `reconstructed`, every
one of them carded and marked — and WHERE each one stands is still a rule rather than a
list somebody typed, because that is the only part of this the evidence can hold.

THE STANDS ARE OFFERED BY THE STREETS AND KEPT BY THE GROUND. A stand is offered every
`TOWN_PITCH_M` of a street's own centreline — 34 m on a principal street, 70 m on an
ordinary one, 110 m down a lane, because that is the traffic each carries — at the verge
outside the travelled track. Then the ground answers, and it refuses far more than it
keeps. A stand is refused IN WRITING, with its reason, if it would put a wagon inside a
committed footprint or within a metre of one; on a plank walk or a board crossing
(`data/frontage/`, the same rectangles `frontage.js` hands the planters as `keepOut`); in
a dooryard garden or an animal pen (`data/enclosures/`'s own `ground.treatment` — a wagon
belongs on a WORKING yard's worn earth and nowhere else behind a fence); in the travelled
track of any street including its own, at a crossing most of all; on a wharf deck or a
beached hull; below the water surface or off the modelled ground; or within six metres of
a wagon already standing. Both sides of the street are tried, in a stated order, and a
stand that fails on both records both reasons.

WHAT THE PICTURES DRIVE, and it is the type rather than the place. The owner's brief
(`data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md`) draws an ox-drawn COVERED WAGON
TRAIN on the river street (image 11), farm wagons in the Green Tree's yard and a covered
wagon under its shed (image 7), and a covered wagon on the open road (image 12). A tier-5
retrospective view may drive furniture and setting and may never drive a coordinate, so
the plates decide WHAT stands and the street lines decide WHERE: the river street's wagons
are all covered and all drawn up the same way, a principal street alternates covered and
farm box, an ordinary street runs farm boxes with a two-wheeled cart at every third stand,
and a lane gets carts. NO DRAFT ANIMAL IS DRAWN ANYWHERE — this project models no fauna in
the scene at all (`renderers/web/js/fauna.js` is a card, not a herd) — so every wagon here
stands UNHITCHED: tongues and shafts down on the ground, and the ox-yokes laid by on the
grass beside the covered wagons and the yard wagons.

WHAT IS INVENTED is every object on this record: that these particular frontages had goods
out on 1 July 1835, how many, and what a barrel, a crate and a wagon of this place and year
looked like. All of it is graded `reconstructed` and claimed in `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L131.

THE MARKS ON THEM (T-0065), AND THE RESTRAINT THAT WAS OVERRULED. This file used to end the
paragraph above with *"no barrel carries a mark, a brand, a merchant's name or a stencil, and
no crate is labelled"* — L25's discipline for the one documented sign, generalised twice.
**The owner closed it, 2026-08-18, verbatim: "you can add period correct names and brands and
labels to things."** His standing ruling of the same day covers the tier: *"you are totally
fine to be liberal with adding reconstructed items when i ask for things, you can just label
and mark them as such."* It is the same override T-0064 took for the wagons and T-0066 for the
signboards, and the answer is the same shape: the mark is `reconstructed`, it is dealt by a
RULE rather than typed, and `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L166 states its bounds.

WHAT A MARK MAY SAY, and every clause of this is a fence around the invention.

  * **The house's own name** — already in this dataset, already attested, already painted on
    the board one layer over. `_house_mark` takes the possessive owner out of the record's
    name ("P. F. W. Peck's Store" -> "P. F. W. PECK") and otherwise keeps the name the
    signboard paints, so a cask at Peck's door and the board over it agree.
  * **A commodity word from the trade's OWN attested description.** The dossiers write these
    businesses up in their own advertisements' words — Peck *"advertising dry goods, hardware
    and groceries"*, Brewster & Hogan *"dealers in dry goods, groceries and hardware"*, Jones's
    *"grocery and provision store"* — so the CATEGORY a stencil names is the category the
    source names, and only the individual word on the individual cask is invented. The stocks
    are in `MARK_STOCKS`, one list per trade class, each list bounded by that description.
  * **A destination, and one port.** A packing case in transit carried its consignee and where
    it was going, so the cases read the house's mark over "CHICAGO". The forwarding houses'
    cases add the port they came from, and the port is not free either: the schooner arrivals
    the dossiers record come from BUFFALO (`docs/research/04-structures-south.md`, the
    *Jackson* from Buffalo 1833-06-27).
  * **Nothing else.** No trademark, no maker nobody in this town is recorded as dealing with,
    no price, no date, no slogan. A word that is not the house's own name or a period commodity
    of its own attested trade does not go on a barrel.

WHICH MARK LANDS ON WHICH CASK is dealt, not chosen: `_rank` is a sha1 of the structure id, so
the deal is the same on every run and two neighbouring frontages do not both open with FLOUR.
Every third cask on a frontage carries the HOUSE's brand instead of a commodity, because a
cooper's or a merchant's brand burned into the head is as period-correct as the stencil and it
is what ties the goods to the door they stand at.

    WHAT THE PLATE GIVES: an open-sided wagon shed attached at the left of the
    house with a covered wagon standing under it. WHAT IT MAY NOT GIVE: which
    wall, and how big. Both are derived here.

    WHICH WALL, and this is the one judgement in the function. The plate's word is
    "left", which is a word about a viewpoint and not about a building — so it is
    read as *the end of the elevation away from the streets*, and three committed
    facts say the same wall. The placement record puts the front on Canal (west)
    and the long side on Lake (south), so the yard is the north and east ground.
    T-0080's two farm wagons already stand off the east (rear) wall, one metre
    clear of it. That leaves the NORTH side wall, which is the only wall of this
    inn that is neither a street frontage nor already occupied — and a wagon shed
    is a yard building, entered off the yard rather than off a corporation street.
    WHAT IS NOT HONOURED, said out loud rather than smoothed over: the committed
    massing runs this building's ridge along its depth (`frame_tavern` lays the
    ridge on the longer axis, 12.19 m here against 7.62 m), which puts its GABLES
    on the front and the rear and makes the north wall an eaves wall. So the shed
    stands at the left END and not at a gable, and the gable half of the plate is
    a correction to the building's fabric, which is bake-gated and is T-0083's.

    HOW BIG is arithmetic on numbers this record already carries: the bay is as
    long as the wagon's body with half a metre of air at each end, as deep as the
    ground `WAGON_CLEAR_M` gives a parked wagon, and its open eave stands a
    hand's breadth over the tilt it has to cover.
