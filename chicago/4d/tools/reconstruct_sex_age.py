"""T-1304: the sex and age no evidence can settle, drawn from the model and said so.

    python3 tools/reconstruct_sex_age.py --build       write the model, the cards, the ledger
    python3 tools/reconstruct_sex_age.py --check       everything re-derives; nothing drifted

    python3 tools/reconstruct_sex_age.py --self-test   the rules below, held over what it draws

This is stage `attribute_fill_sex_age` of the resident reconstruction programme
(data/reconstruction/1835_resident_reconstruction_programme.json, T-1167). It writes NO
person: it fills two RECONSTRUCTED attribute blocks on people the sources already name.
`tools/reconstruct_residents_1835.py --stage attribute_fill_sex_age --build` is the
programme's front door to it, and the programme's record contract is held here in full.

WHAT T-1303 LEFT. That pass read sex and age off the evidence and stopped where the
evidence stopped: 593 of 1,282 people carried no sex and 1,218 no birth year. Its
refusals were right and none of them is reversed here. What changes is that a refusal is
no longer an empty field — it is a DRAW from a measured distribution, marked
`reconstructed`, carrying the seed that reproduces it and the evidence that would retire
it. The three tiers of T-1168 are complete when this runs: recorded, read, drawn.

THE BUCKET IS THE ROLL, AND THE RATE IS MEASURED ON IT. The ticket asks that the 205
people known only as an initial off a letter list be sexed "at the measured adult-male
rate of a letter list, and the measurement stated rather than assumed". The measurement
is this layer's own: of the letter-list people whose forename IS spelled and whose sex
T-1303 settled, 351 of 372 are men — 94.4%. The same measurement is taken for every roll
the layer was minted from (civic, documented, placed, and the people no pass claims), and
a roll that settles fewer than MIN_SAMPLE names is not measured separately; it draws at
the pooled rate of all rolls, and the ledger says which rolls did that.

AND THE MEASUREMENT'S OWN BIAS IS STATED, because it runs one way. The forename table
T-1303 derived was built mostly on this layer's men, so a woman's forename is likelier
than a man's to be missing from it and to fall into the unsettled group that is being
drawn for. 94.4% is therefore a CEILING on the letter lists' male share rather than a
point reading of it, and every draw made from it leans male by an amount this pass cannot
bound. It is written into the ledger and into docs/LIBERTIES.md rather than smoothed.

THE ROLLS ARE NOT THE TOWN, and that gap is the whole reconstruction's brief. The town
model reads 120.9-150 males per 100 females (a 55-60% male town); these rolls read 94%
male. The difference is not a disagreement — a roll of correspondents, voters and
subscribers names adult men, and the town's women and children are named nowhere in it.
Nothing here is drawn at the town's ratio, because none of these people is a draw from
the town: they are people a roll already named. T-1174 writes the women and children the
pyramid lacks, and it is a different stage with a different quota.

AGE: A BAND, NEVER A YEAR. The only committed sex x age band distribution this project
holds is the 1840 Chicago schedule, read into data/research/census_1840/composition_1840
.json, whose `what_this_may_calibrate` admits exactly this use and whose
`what_this_may_not_do` forbids the other one: it may not name anybody or supply a person
to a household, and this pass does neither. A draw yields the band the schedule prints -
`20 under 30` - and the card carries that band. NO BIRTH YEAR IS WRITTEN. An exact year
drawn from a decadal band would read as a record of a birth, which is the precise
misrepresentation T-1303 refused six thin death-notice matches to avoid.

THE CONDITIONING IS THE MODEL'S, NOT A SOURCE'S, and T-1303 handed that finding here:
no age may be derived from an adult status until the rule is in a source record. It is
not, so the rule is not derived - it is DECLARED, as a liberty, and the card says so in
those words. Three conditionings, each naming what it assumes:

  * `civic_list_20_and_over` - the person stands on a poll, tax or muster list. Drawn
    from the bands 20 and over, the 1840 schedule's own adult line.
  * `named_on_a_roll_15_and_over` - the person is named in their own right on a roll of
    correspondents, litigants, subscribers or tradesmen. Drawn from 15 and over: the
    schedule counts a child as a tally inside a household and never as a correspondent,
    and 15 rather than 20 because an apprentice or a journeyman is on a trade roll.
  * `dependent_child_under_15` - the register calls the person an infant or a baptised
    child, or the household calls them a son, a daughter or a child.

A COLLECTIVE DESCRIPTION IS STILL REFUSED. "The four Temple children" is a row about
four people and has no sex and no band of its own. Six such rows get an explicit
`unknown` block that says why, rather than a draw that would make a group into a person.
