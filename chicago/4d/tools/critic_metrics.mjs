/**
 * critic_metrics.mjs — the measurement half of the critic harness (RENDERING G0).
 *
 *   node tools/critic_metrics.mjs <file.png|dir> [...]     print JSON for each frame
 *
 * `tools/critic_shots.mjs` captures frames; this file turns them into the
 * numbers `docs/RENDERING.md` § 5 argues about, so a phase can prove its delta
 * instead of describing it. It reads PNGs and nothing else — which means the
 * SAME code measures a reference photograph and one of our frames. That matters
 * more than it sounds: every number in the 2026-08-10 prairie sweep came out of
 * a harness that no longer exists, so our figures and its reference figures were
 * never once produced by one implementation. Point this at a reference JPEG-
 * turned-PNG and the comparison is finally like for like.
 *
 * NO DEPENDENCIES, deliberately. The PNG decoder below is forty lines over
 * node:zlib, which is cheaper than owning an image library on a gate that has to
 * run in every sandbox.
 *
 * WHAT EACH NUMBER MEANS — the recipes are RENDERING Appendix B; the exact
 * thresholds are this file's, because Appendix B states the shape of each
 * measurement and not its constants. They are stated here rather than tuned per
 * call so that two runs, two phases and two years are comparable:
 *
 *   land/sky boundary   per column, the first row from the top whose next
 *                       `runPx` rows are ALL non-sky. Sky is blue-dominant
 *                       (B > R and B > G); ground is not, at any fog level this
 *                       renderer reaches. The sustained run is what separates
 *                       the GROUND line from the top of a tree: horizon timber
 *                       is two to four pixels tall and never satisfies it.
 *   horizon timber      in the band immediately above that line, a column counts
 *                       as BROKEN if a pixel there falls at least 3 luma below
 *                       — or 3 G−B above — the sky's own gradient EXTRAPOLATED
 *                       into the band from the twenty rows over it. A constant
 *                       sky reference does not work: the haze brightens steeply
 *                       toward the horizon and reports the air itself as trees.
 *                       BROKEN IS NOT TIMBERED: a gable end breaks a skyline as
 *                       surely as an oak, and `coverageAll` counts both. The
 *                       timber figure is `timberOnly`, measured on a second
 *                       capture of the same station with the town hidden, and it
 *                       is the one RENDERING § 5's ≥ 90 % target is about. See
 *                       the block over the recipe in `measure` for why the hue
 *                       discriminator was measured and abandoned.
 *   depth-band RMS      5x5 high-pass on Rec.709 luma over sRGB 0-255, in three
 *                       equal bands down from the median boundary. Collapse
 *                       toward the far band is the tell (§ 1 item 4).
 *   crown fine detail   over crown pixels (above the boundary, non-sky, and
 *                       G >= R so a clapboard gable is not a canopy):
 *                       RMS(I - blur3) / RMS(blur3 - blur9).
 *   shadow decile       mean CIE L* of the darkest tenth of ground pixels, plus
 *                       a count of literal (0,0,0) anywhere in frame.
 *   crown G-B           mean G-B over the brightest third of crown pixels, in
 *                       sRGB units, which is how § 1 item 8 is quoted.
 *   flower load         flower-hued / (plant-hued + flower-hued) over ground
 *                       pixels. Bright and saturated off-green, or near-white
 *                       and bright. HONEST LIMIT: a frame containing streets,
 *                       walls or roofs feeds them into the denominator or worse,
 *                       so this figure is only meaningful at the open-prairie
 *                       stations. It is reported everywhere and quoted there.
 *
 * Every threshold above is a measurement convention, not a claim about 1835.
 *
 * Two exported colour helpers are not frame metrics and have no thresholds:
 * `relativeLuminance` (linear Y) and `weberContrast` (R-M1's exposure-invariant
 * scale). They live here so that anything measuring contrast in this project
 * measures it the same way — see the block over `weberContrast`.

 * Weber contrast — `(Y_target − Y_background) / Y_background`, on linear
 * luminance, signed, `null` where the background carries no light to divide by.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE OWNS IT, and why it is not a rewrite of `labL`. Both scales are
 * right about different things and R-M1 is the parcel that needs both.
 *
 *   `labL` is PERCEPTUAL. Equal steps are roughly equal perceived difference —
 *   but only under a fixed adaptation state. That precondition held for as long
 *   as the renderer's exposure was fixed, and R-W1 is the first change to break
 *   it: it preserved the road/ground ratio to within 0.4 % and still lost the
 *   road gate, because the whole scene got 14–17 % darker and ΔL* is
 *   compressive. ΔL* did not fail there; its assumption did.
 *
 *   Weber is EXPOSURE-INVARIANT by construction. Scale both terms by any k and
 *   the k cancels, so it answers "is the road distinguishable from the ground"
 *   without also answering "how bright is the scene". That is exactly the
 *   separation the owner ruled for on 2026-08-14: score contrast, and keep an
 *   absolute floor beside it, because contrast sensitivity genuinely collapses
 *   at low luminance and a ratio alone would pass a scene too dark to see
 *   anything in. Neither number is a replacement for the other.
 *
 * The BACKGROUND is the denominator, which is what makes it Weber rather than a
 * bare ratio: it is the surface the target is being picked out from. For the
 * road gate that is the same pixel with the street layer hidden, so a road on
 * grass and a road on mud are held to one standard.
 *
 * `trees.js` already reasons in this quantity against the reference photograph
 * (0.625 tree-mass-against-sky there, 0.655 in the scene) and `LIBERTIES.md`
 * quotes it, but until now nothing in `tools/` computed it, so every figure was
 * produced by hand at the point of use.
