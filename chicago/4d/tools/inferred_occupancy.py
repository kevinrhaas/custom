"""The occupancy ledger the anonymous-infill generators read.

TWO PROGRAMMES SEAT AN OCCUPANT ON AN ANONYMOUS ROOF, and both arrive here.

`tools/generate_inferred_infill.py` and `tools/generate_north_infill.py` build the
anonymous roofs of the 665-roof programme and re-derive them byte-for-byte on every
commit. Phase two of the inferred-residents programme (docs/ROADMAP.md K1) ADOPTS
some of those roofs: an inferred household takes one as its dwelling or its shop,
and the roof stops being anonymous massing and becomes a building with an argument
behind it.

That has to reach the structure record, or the adoption exists only in
`data/residents/` and a visitor clicking the building is told nothing. But editing
a generated record by hand would fail the very drift check that makes the
anonymous parcels trustworthy. So the link is data: the household programme names
the roof, this module hands the resulting `occupants` block to whichever generator
owns that roof, and both parcels stay re-derivable from their recipes.

An adopted roof's own existence, position and footprint stay exactly as
conjectural as they were. Nothing here is evidence that a building stood on that
spot; it is evidence about who the town must have held, attached to a roof the
programme had already placed.

THE SECOND PROGRAMME IS STREET-FACE ADOPTION (T-0354, the owner's ruling of
2026-08-29; docs/STREET-FACE-ADOPTION.md, liberty L212). Where the newspaper
register can place a DOCUMENTED business no closer than a platted street, the
business adopts a reconstructed roof already standing on that street face.
`tools/adopt_street_faces.py` derives the allocation into
`data/research/newspapers/street_face_adoptions.json`; until T-0410 nothing SPENT
it, so the policy's own file said in as many words that the table allocates and
"nothing here writes a card" while the roofs still carded as anonymous
count-units. This module is where it is spent, for the same reason the household
programme is: hand-editing a generated record would fail the drift check that
makes the anonymous parcels trustworthy.

The difference between the two is the difference the cards have to be able to say
in one breath. The household layer names NO PERSON — it hypothesises an occupant
from the town's arithmetic. The adoption layer names a business the papers PRINT,
with its trade, its street and its claims cited; what is invented there is the
whole of the PLACEMENT, which is why the block is still graded `reconstructed`.
