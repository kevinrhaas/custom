"""The research sign-off: one owner-readable receipt over the spend, and the GO it carries (T-1157).

WHAT THIS IS. The owner asked, on 2026-09-17, to "confirm that all of the research has been
spent successfully on building residents households trades occupations … and also the business
structures and where everyone works and lives, their primary and any other locations they were
significantly involved in." This is that confirmation, read from the tree rather than typed,
and it ends in a GO or a NO-GO for the reconstruction bands.

WHAT IT IS NOT. It re-decides nothing. `measure_research_spend.py` accounts for the research
from the SOURCE side; `report_research_closing_audit.py` (T-1241) reads the same ledger onto
the four town layers and prints the gaps. Both are gated already, and this report cites them
rather than recomputing them. What is new here is the five axes the owner named — residents and
households, plural dated roles, businesses and who works where, primary and other significant
locations, and whether the withheld research is legible — each reduced to a small number of
CONDITIONS that either hold in the committed tree or do not, and a verdict derived from them.

A STATED GAP IS A FINISHED ANSWER. Zero unclassified is not the bar and never was: the queue's
own header says "zero unclassified research does not mean forcing uncertain people or locations
into 1835." So a condition here asks whether the research is ACCOUNTED FOR, never whether it is
large. Section 7 lists the gaps that remain, each with the ticket that owns it; none of them is
a blocker unless a condition says so, and the report says which is which in both directions.

THE VERDICT IS DERIVED. Every condition below is a measurement over committed files, so the
GO line cannot be edited into existence: change the tree and the verdict re-derives, and
`--check` refuses a report that no longer matches. That is deliberate. If a condition breaks
after this is signed, check.sh goes red and the next run has to re-derive the signature rather
than inherit it.

`--build` writes the report; `--check` re-derives it and refuses a drifted one, which is how
tools/check.sh consumes it; `--self-test` mutates each condition and proves the verdict moves.
