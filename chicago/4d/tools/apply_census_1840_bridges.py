The recovered v4 work is now retained as a complete dated census layer: **{len(all_census)} named 1840 household-head rows on printed pages 229–235, all with resolved IPUMS SERIALs and household demographic fields**. These records live under `data/census/1840/` whether or not they can yet be tied safely to a 1 July 1835 resident.

Canonical resident linkage is a separate assertion. There are currently **{len(validated)} validated High-confidence 1835↔1840 identity bridges** — John Murphy (1840 p.233 r.30, SERIAL 5102066) and William Hanford Adams (p.229 r.9, SERIAL 5101954) — plus **{len(provisional)} provisional bridge**, John Miller ↔ John J. Miller (p.232 r.3, SERIAL 5102035). Miller is independently attested as the Chicago tanner and 1833 trustee, but the 1840 middle initial is new, so the link remains Medium/provisional rather than High.

**1840 is later evidence, not the 1835 household.** Household totals, children, sex structure, industry, foreigner and literacy fields are retained under the census dataset and `later_census` links for household-reconciliation research, but are not projected backward to 1 July 1835. Murphy's 1840 household has 6 people; Adams 2; Miller 5. Those counts do not themselves mint spouses, children, partners, servants or boarders into the 1835 resident layer.

The old September 2 “0 links / 29 unmatched heads” result is preserved in the machine ledger as the **legacy partial matcher** result. It came from the older pages-234/235 partial CSV plus exact normalized-name matching and did not consume the later v4 adjudication.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# T-0515 — the candidates, and why so few of them become bridges
#
# The ticket asks for the bridge CSV to be EXTENDED from the 1840 appearances
# the identity consolidation now carries, "keeping its rule — a bridge needs an
# adjudicated discriminator; composition is never back-projected". This mode
# derives every candidate that consolidation offers and rules on each one, so
# the links this project has NOT made are as legible as the three it has.
#
# The three rules, in the order they fire. A candidate must pass all three.
#
#   B1  A SERIAL. The bridge row's key is the 1840 dwelling serial, and the only
#       place a serial exists is the 210-row recovery of the owner's v4 workbook
#       (pages 229-235). An appearance citing any other page — and 33 of the 40
#       cite pages 207-228 — has been read off the deposited image, and those
#       page files carry the schedule's ruled lines and no serial at all. There
#       is nothing to key a bridge on, and one keyed on a page and a row alone
#       would not survive the duplicate-serial check this tool already enforces.
#
#   B2  THE TWO READINGS AGREE ON WHO IT IS. PR #683 established that where a
#       page in the recovery has since been read off the image the two disagree,
#       sometimes about the head's name. Six of the seven candidates that clear
#       B1 are exactly that: the consolidation reads Gurdon S. Hubbard at 232:17
#       and the recovery's own preferred name for that line is Samuel J. McCord.
#       A bridge across that disagreement would be picking a winner in the very
#       dispute the tool was built to keep visible.
#
#   B3  AN ADJUDICATED DISCRIMINATOR. The rule the three committed bridges were
#       written under: something beyond the name — an 1833/1834/1835 poll or tax
#       hit, or a directory match — that is not itself flagged as a common-name
#       caution. The last candidate standing, John Wilson at 229:2, fails on the
#       recovery's own words: "Common-name caution."
#
# So the honest count today is zero new bridges, and this ledger is the reason
# rather than a silence. It is DERIVED — re-run it when a page is read or a
# discriminator is adjudicated and the candidate moves by itself.
