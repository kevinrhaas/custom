/**
 * test_pr_stuck.mjs — the reporter that ends the silence around a pull request
 * nothing in this repository can move (T-1368), tested in the four states that
 * look identical from outside and must be told apart.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A `dirty` PR has no merge ref, so the `pull_request` gate
 * cannot start, so it carries zero check runs, so `gate` — a required check —
 * never passes, so merge-ready.sh never sees `clean` and the lap correctly
 * refuses a conflict it does not own. Nothing advances. Measured on #1495 and
 * #1497 (2026-09-19) and again on #1587, #1585, #1584 and #1590 (2026-09-20):
 * six pull requests, six pairs of hands, and both of the first two merged
 * THEMSELVES within minutes of a person pushing the merge — the rest of the
 * automation was sound and the only missing piece was anyone being told.
 *
 * AND THE SHAPE ALONE DOES NOT IDENTIFY IT, which is the whole difficulty and
 * every case below:
 *
 *   #1499  dirty, zero checks — and its run was STILL GOING. It rebased onto
 *          `dev` twice, re-derived, pushed and cleared itself with no hands at
 *          all. Acting on it would have collided with a live run for nothing.
 *   #1533  dirty, zero checks — and labelled `hold`, the owner's park switch.
 *   #1576  the same, and mistaken for the deadlock on 2026-09-20 as well.
 *   #1518  `unknown` indefinitely, and merged fine when asked directly.
 *
 * THE SCRIPT IS NOT COPIED HERE. Every case runs the REAL
 * `.github/steward/pr-stuck.sh` with `gh` faked on PATH, so a change that makes
 * it shout at a held or mid-run pull request fails here rather than on `dev`.
