"""THE 285 ANONYMOUS ROOFS, RE-AUDITED AGAINST THE RE-DERIVED PROGRAMME. T-1445.

    tools/redeal_anonymous_roofs.py --build       adjudicate, write the ledger and the report
    tools/redeal_anonymous_roofs.py --check       re-derive and refuse drift
    tools/redeal_anonymous_roofs.py --self-test   the guards, fired on fixtures

WHAT THIS TOOL IS. An ADJUDICATION over committed derived files, in the same
genre as the order book (T-1166), the placement policy (T-1195) and the roof
programme's re-derivation (T-1196). It reads no page of any source, opens no
network, names nobody, and MOVES NO ROOF. It asks one question of each of the
285 anonymous roofs the 2026-08 block recipes dealt --- now that the population
is modelled and the programme re-derived, does the town still want a roof of
this kind, in this place? --- and writes the answer with the arithmetic that
reached it.

T-1197 asked for the audit and its execution together and was split: this piece
is the verdict, T-1446 carries it out in the recipe files and the bake. Nothing
here is a demolition. Every roof that stops being what it was becomes something
else the order book has an occupant for, and the ledger records the SUBSTITUTION
--- the bucket it leaves and the bucket it joins --- rather than a deletion.

THE THREE VERDICTS, and the test that reaches each:

  keep      The order book has an occupant class for a roof of this family in
            this division, and some clause of the placement policy accepts the
            family at this position. Nothing to do.

  refamily  The SLOT is wanted and the KIND is wrong. Either no clause of the
            roof's own family accepts where it stands --- a store-residence
            sixteen metres back inside a block, a barn on a principal street ---
            or its division/group cell is oversubscribed and another cell in the
            same division is short. The position stands; the family, the form
            and the footprint band move to a family whose clauses DO accept the
            position and whose group the division still has head in.

  retire    Nothing in the order book wants a roof of this kind here and no
            family it could become is wanted either. The record leaves the
            standing count for T-1446 to move into `data/exclusions.json`.

WHAT THE TOOL WILL NOT DO, and each refusal is recorded rather than worked round:

  * AN OCCUPIED ROOF IS NEVER REFAMILIED. 71 of the 285 carry an `occupants`
    block --- the households and firms seated on them by T-1185, L212 and L218.
    A roof with somebody in it is by definition one the order book can occupy,
    and re-dealing it would move a seated household into a building of another
    kind behind its back. Where such a roof breaches the placement policy the
    breach is KEPT AND STATED (`kept_occupied`), which is a debt owed to the
    seating tickets, not a verdict this tool may take on their behalf.

  * A CONFIDENCE IS NEVER UPGRADED. Every one of these roofs is
    `inferred_anonymous` and stays so. Refamilying changes what an invented
    building is, never how well attested it is.

  * A HEAD THAT IS NOT THERE IS NOT BORROWED. A roof only moves into a group
    the division is actually short in, counted against the inventory's own
    district/group matrix as this tool walks. When a breaching roof has nowhere
    to go it is kept and the breach is owed out.

THE ONE NUMBER THAT MAKES THIS AN AUDIT AND NOT A CULL. The programme wants 668
roofs and 371 stand. The town is 297 roofs SHORT, so `retire` is the rare
verdict and not the common one: there is almost nowhere a standing roof is
surplus to what the order book can occupy. Any tool that came back from this
audit with a long retirement list would be measuring something other than the
order book.
