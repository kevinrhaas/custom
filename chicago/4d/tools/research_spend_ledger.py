    A `split` parent is a terminal state in the ticket tool — the children take its
    place in the queue and carry its work — so read flatly it looks exactly like a
    ticket that FINISHED. That difference is load-bearing here, because the only thing
    this state is asked is whether an unresolved research unit is still deferred to live
    work. When T-1147 was split into five pieces, 748 units across the book, directory
    and letter-list claims were suddenly reading as deferred to a closed ticket, and the
    gate said so; none of them had changed, and the work they wait on had not stopped.

    So a `split` parent reports `split_live` while at least one of its children is
    itself open, and plain `split` once every child has closed. The invariant is
    unchanged and is the strict one: a unit may only defer to work that is still going
    to happen. What changes is that re-filing work no longer reads as finishing it.

# it had been perfectly happy with the hour before. That is the rule working. The owner of
# an unasserted PERSON unit is now T-1234, which is the piece of the parent that still has
# this corpus to spend: T-1232 read the 94 matched resident-research blocks and T-1234 has
# the book claims, the Newberry index units and the letter-list name suspicions.
# T-1236 WAS SPLIT, AND AN OWNER MUST BE AN OPEN TICKET. The epic owned 3,384 unasserted
# units by default, and the owner's bound capped it at three children BY WEIGHT rather than
# nine by corpus. The moment the parent went to `split` every one of those units named a
# ticket in a state this gate refuses — the same rule that went red on 61 units when T-1146
# was split, working exactly as intended. The default owner is therefore routed by domain to

# T-1240 was withdrawn, so the pass has spent what it could spend. What it left behind is
# 748 newspaper, book, directory, civic and church units that describe a business, a
# building, a street or a piece of infrastructure and reach no structured target — not
# because nobody has looked at them, but because THE LAYER THAT WOULD RECEIVE THEM IS NOT
# BUILT YET. There is no authored business record to carry an enterprise claim (T-1180) and
# no seat on the ground to carry a place claim (T-1198).
#
# Leaving them pointed at T-1147 made the last open child of that parent load-bearing: close
# T-1241 and the parent falls out of `split_live`, and 748 units that had not changed would
# suddenly be deferred to finished work. T-1241's own file records that, and records the

# available, `unresolved`, and the only way to close it was to write code that guessed. So
# 3,471 person units sat owned by a ticket whose title covered 87 of them.
# data/research/spend_rulings.json is the written alternative: a named rule with a stated
# reason, and a note on every single unit it closes. It is consulted ONLY where the
# derivation ends in `unresolved`, so a ruling can never overturn an assertion, a
# later_only or a refusal the reading itself carries — the readings stay in charge.
