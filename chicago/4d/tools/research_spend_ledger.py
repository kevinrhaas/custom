    A `split` parent is a terminal state in the ticket tool — the children take its
    place in the queue and carry its work — so read flatly it looks exactly like a
    ticket that FINISHED. That difference is load-bearing here, because the only thing
    this state is asked is whether an unresolved research unit is still deferred to live
    work. When T-1147 was split into five pieces, 748 units across the book, directory
    and letter-list claims were suddenly reading as deferred to a closed ticket, and the
    gate said so; none of them had changed, and the work they wait on had not stopped.

    So a `split` parent reports `split_live` while at least one of its children is
    itself open, and plain `split` once every child has closed. The invariant is
    unchanged and is the strict one: a unit may only defer to work that is still going
    to happen. What changes is that re-filing work no longer reads as finishing it.

# `target_index` is one dictionary over every reading unit in the project, and until this
# ticket its key was the row's own `source_record_id`. For a person id or a land-sale
# certificate that is a name the whole corpus agrees on. For a newspaper claim it is
# `c004` -- a POSITION in the extraction of ONE issue, which 55 issue files each print --
# so a resident card naming `c004` was read as naming every one of them. It was not a
# hazard waiting to happen: 145 units were closed `asserted` on it the day this ticket
# was taken, off three cards that had each cited exactly one claim. `hh_taylor_c`'s
# arrival cites `chicago_democrat_1835_08_19#c007` and closed 74; `hh_dole_george_w`'s
# reason_for_coming cites `chicago_democrat_1834_04_01#c013` and `chicago_democrat_
# 1835_07_01#c015` and closed 71 between them, one of which was not even a newspaper.
# A ledger that overstates its own spend is wrong in the direction it must never be wrong
# in, and the 128 press units this ticket's parent left cannot be spent one at a time
# until a bound can name ONE claim.
#
# The key is therefore the source file's stem and the row's id, joined by `#` -- the form
# the cards' own prose had been writing all along. Which containers need it is DECLARED in
# domains.json rather than guessed, because the two cases are genuinely different and no
# shape tells them apart: `residents` people ids repeat across the pass cohorts and mean
# the same man each time, and `newspapers` claim ids repeat and mean nothing outside their
# own file. `record_id_scope_faults` below refuses an undeclared repeat, so the next corpus

# this corpus to spend: T-1232 read the 94 matched resident-research blocks and T-1234 has
# the book claims, the Newberry index units and the letter-list name suspicions.
# T-1236 WAS SPLIT, AND AN OWNER MUST BE AN OPEN TICKET. The epic owned 3,384 unasserted
# units by default, and the owner's bound capped it at three children BY WEIGHT rather than
# nine by corpus. The moment the parent went to `split` every one of those units named a
# ticket in a state this gate refuses — the same rule that went red on 61 units when T-1146
# was split, working exactly as intended. The default owner is therefore routed by domain to
# the piece that actually has that corpus to spend.

# domain. A unit whose reading says nothing self-classifying had exactly one outcome
# available, `unresolved`, and the only way to close it was to write code that guessed. So
# 3,471 person units sat owned by a ticket whose title covered 87 of them.
# data/research/spend_rulings.json is the written alternative: a named rule with a stated
# reason, and a note on every single unit it closes. It is consulted ONLY where the
# derivation ends in `unresolved`, so a ruling can never overturn an assertion, a
# later_only or a refusal the reading itself carries — the readings stay in charge.

# A RULING MAY SAY `asserted`, AND IT IS THE ONLY DISPOSITION THAT MUST PROVE ITSELF (T-1330).
# The derivation above closes a unit as `asserted` on one test: a source-bearing structured
# field on a resident card NAMES the unit's record id AND cites a source the unit itself
# lists. That test cannot see the spend this project most wants to make -- a finding that
# brings a NEW volume and writes what it says onto the card -- because the new volume is by
# definition not among the sources the reading already carried. Nine of T-1330's thirty
# enrichments are exactly that: Peck's Providence birth out of the Chicago History Museum's
# encyclopedia, Hugunin's 17 August 1833 arrival out of the Old Settlers proceedings, each
# replacing a value the arrival stage had DRAWN from a distribution. Left to the derivation
# they read `unresolved` for ever, and the register's only way to close them would be to call
# a written assertion `refused`, which would understate the spend in the one direction a
# ledger must never be wrong in.
#
# So a ruling may assert, and a ruling that asserts must NAME THE FIELD: `wrote` on the
# ruling row, a LIST of `{"file": <path under data/residents/>, "field": <key>}` because a
# finding can fill two of them at once. The checks below are
# the whole of the licence -- the file exists, the field is there, it is `attested`,
# `inferred` or `documented`, it cites at least one source, and it names the unit's own
# record id. A row that cannot show all five is a fault and not an assertion, which keeps
# `asserted` something a register has to earn rather than something it can declare.
# THE RULING'S PROOF NAMES THE SAME KEY THE DERIVATION DOES (T-1338). `record_id` here is
# the unit's `record_key`, so a ruling that asserts a file-local unit has to show the
# FILE-QUALIFIED id on the card. A bare `c004` proved nothing about which issue was read.
