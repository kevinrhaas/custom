WHY THIS EXISTS. The owner asked that "all people should have a best profile", and the
layer did not have one: of 1,282 people, 99 carried a sex and 10 a birth year. T-1168 set
out the three tiers a profile may stand on — attested where a source says it, inferred
where the evidence about that person allows it, reconstructed from the population model
otherwise — and was split because the third tier needs the model's writer, which is
another run's work. THIS PASS IS THE FIRST TWO TIERS AND NOTHING ELSE. Where the evidence
is silent this pass stays silent, and T-1304 fills the silence from the model.

WHAT IT WRITES, in four rules, each of which says on the card which one fired.

  1. SEX FROM A GENDERED TITLE. "Mrs Rufus Brown", "Miss Eliza Chappel", "The Widow
     Wells" — the title is a statement about the person's sex made by whoever wrote the
     name down, and it is the strongest thing a name can carry. A RANK IS NOT A TITLE
     HERE: Capt., Col., Rev. and Maj. would be right nearly every time in this town and
     would still be a guess about the period rather than a fact about the person, so this
     pass reads none of them as male. That refusal is already the profile report's
     (T-1160) and it is kept here word for word.

  2. SEX FROM A FORENAME THAT STANDS IN ONE SEX'S NAMING ONLY. The table is built here,
     from this project's own evidence and nothing else: the people whose sex a source
     already records, and the period forename pools of
     data/reconstruction/1835_invented_name_pools.json, which were themselves assembled
     out of the naming this town has attested. A name the two disagree about, or that the
     recorded people themselves split, is REFUSED rather than decided. So are Jean,
     Marion, Leslie and Francis/Frances, by name, for the reason written beside each.

  3. A BIRTH INTERVAL FROM A DEATH NOTICE. Fergus's 1843 directory (1896) prints an
     obituary list with a death date and an age at death; `tools/spend_old_settlers.py`
     already adjudicated which of its entries meet which people and wrote the arithmetic
     onto the card. This pass spends that arithmetic into a `birth_year` — and only where
     BOTH SIDES SPELL A FORENAME. The crosswalk's own thin matches, where a single
     initial is the whole of the discriminator, are refused: a birth year is exactly the
     kind of value that makes a card read better than its evidence.

  4. A BIRTH INTERVAL FROM A MAN'S OWN AGE AT THE CALUMET CLUB. The registry of 27 May
     1879 prints the age each old settler gave as he registered, and
     data/research/old_settlers/people.json carries the adjudicated merge onto this
     layer's people. An age given at a reception forty-four years after the scene date is
     a recollection about himself, which is a better thing than a recollection about
     somebody else and still not a record of a birth.

WHAT IT REFUSES, and why the refusals are the point.

  * AN INITIAL FIRES NOTHING. 223 of these people are known only as "J. W. Smith" off a
     post-office list. There is no rule that sexes an initial, and the letter lists'
     measured lean is the population model's business (T-1304, which since 2026-09-18
     draws for them at the rate measured on the letter lists themselves), not this pass's.
  * A NAME OUTSIDE THE TABLE FIRES NOTHING. 384 people bear a forename this project has
     no evidence about. Extending the table to period names at large would be invention
     wearing an inference's clothes.
  * NO AGE FROM AN ADULT STATUS. A poll list, a civic office or a trade says a person was
     an adult; it does not say when they were born. The franchise's own age rule is not
     in any source record this project holds, so no year is derived from one. That is a
     finding for T-1304, and it is written into the ticket rather than into a card.
  * AND AN ADULT STATUS THE INTERVAL CONTRADICTS REFUSES THE INTERVAL (T-1179). The rule
     above is about DERIVING a year and is unchanged; this is its converse, which is a
     different statement and was missing. An obituary matched to a name by that name
     alone put George Smith four years old on the scene date while his own advertisements
     had him keeping the Exchange Coffee House through 1834 and 1835. Where an obituary's
     interval leaves a person under the 15 that any roll naming them in their own right
     requires, the SPEND is refused: the `birth_year` block written in its place asserts
     no year at all and carries `refused_because`. The crosswalk's match is not withdrawn
     and no age is asserted instead. Where the interval clears 15 and misses only the franchise's 20 — a
     floor this project admits it invented — nothing is struck out: the year is carried
     with `contradicted_by_the_card` beside it, which is T-1146's disposition and the one
     the letter-list ruling settled on. A man's own age about himself is only ever
     flagged, never refused.
  * NO `age_on_scene_date` OVER A BAND. Every interval this pass writes spans two birth
     years, so an age on 1 July 1835 spans three. Stating one would invent a precision
     the source does not have.
  * A VALUE ALREADY ON THE CARD IS NEVER TOUCHED. The mints own `sex` and the
     biographies own the ten `birth_year` blocks; this pass only ever fills an absence.

WHERE THE VALUES GO. `sex` stays the plain string the mints and the renderer already
read, and the reasoning arrives beside it in `sex_basis` — a `{value, confidence, note}`
claim block of the ordinary shape, so the card can print the tier and the reason without
any new machinery. `birth_year` is the block the biographied ten already use, with
`band` naming the two years the arithmetic leaves open.

AND THE MINTS MUST NOT DROP IT. `sex` is an owned key of the resident mints — a mint's
silence about a person's sex is its own answer and is never resurrected — so a mint
re-running would take this pass's fill with it. `tools/resident_mint_carry.py` carries a
`sex` that arrives with a `sex_basis`, exactly as it already carries `ladder_rule` and
the roles derived after the mint. A pass that writes into a mint-owned key without
saying so is a pass whose work vanishes at the next rebuild.

# WHAT THE CARD ALREADY SAYS ABOUT THIS PERSON'S AGE, and it is a FLOOR rather than a
# year (T-1179). The refusals above say that no age may be derived from an adult status:
# a poll list does not record a birth. The converse is not the same statement and is the
# one this pass had been missing — an adult status cannot GIVE a birth year, but it can
# REFUTE one. George Smith advertised the Exchange Coffee House in the Democrat of 5
# November 1834 and again on 20 May 1835, and this pass spent an obituary onto his card
# that put him four years old on the scene date. Both readings cannot stand, and nothing
# in the tree noticed, because each pass only ever checked its own half.
#
# TWO FLOORS, AND THEY DO DIFFERENT THINGS, because the project does not hold them with
# the same conviction. Both are stated in data/reconstruction/1835_sex_age_model.json as
# conditionings on the age DRAW, and that file is candid about which is which:
#
#   * 15 at the date of any roll that names a person in their own right. The 1840
#     schedule "counts a child as a tally inside a household and never as a
#     correspondent", and the model takes 15 rather than 20 precisely so that an
#     apprentice or a journeyman on a trade roll is not excluded. This is the floor the
#     project defends in its own words, and an interval that puts a person UNDER it is
#     REFUSED: a name match cannot make a correspondent, a taxpayer or a coffee-house
#     keeper into a child of five.
#
#   * 20 on a poll, a tax list or a muster roll — the franchise's line. The model says of
#     it, in capitals, that THE FRANCHISE'S AGE RULE IS NOT IN ANY SOURCE, and carries it
#     under the liberty L-rc-age-conditioning. A floor this project admits it invented may
#     not be used to strike out evidence. So an interval that clears 15 and misses 20 is
#     not refused; it is CARRIED, with the disagreement written beside it, which is the
#     disposition T-1146 calls `contradicted` and the one the letter-list ruling settled
#     on: the pass says a collision instead of acting on it.
#
# AND A MAN'S OWN AGE ABOUT HIMSELF IS NEVER REFUSED, only ever flagged. Rule 4 above is
# a recollection by the person; rule 3 is an obituary matched to a name. Only the second
# is weak in the way a refusal answers.
#
# A refusal WRITES NOTHING ONTO THE PERSON except the refusal: the interval is not
# narrowed, no age is asserted, and the crosswalk's match is left exactly where
# tools/spend_old_settlers.py put it. What is refused is the SPEND, and the card says so
