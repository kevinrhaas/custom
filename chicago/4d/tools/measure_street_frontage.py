"""How much building each committed street carries, so the face rule stops being a memory.

ROADMAP T-A14. Every block parcel since T-A8 has had to decide which of its two faces is
the better street, and every one of them has answered from the street's documented use —
"South Water is the business front" — which says nothing at all about a block bounded by
Randolph and Washington. T-A13 was the first to measure it instead, counting structures
within 25 m of each street's committed centreline, and reported Lake 12, Randolph 2 and
South Water 9.

**Those three numbers do not reproduce.** Under the filter T-A13's own note states — every
documented or inferred structure whose footprint centroid stands within 25 m of the
committed centreline — the committed record gives materially different counts, and the
filter that would give T-A13's is not written down anywhere in the repository. The
measurement was right to make and the finding it supported (Lake is the better face, by a
wide margin) survives every filter this tool can express; what did not survive is the
number, because it was derived by hand and thrown away.

So it is a command now. A parcel that needs the face rule runs this and quotes it. The
three layers are reported separately and never merged, because they are not the same kind
of evidence and one of them cannot vote:

* **research** — the documented layer. Records recovered from sources. This is the layer
  the face rule is actually asking about.
* **inferred_household** — the trade-census layer. Positions are argued, not recovered.
* **reconstruction** — the anonymous count-units the block parcels themselves place. A
  block parcel that let this layer decide its arrangement would be reading its own output
  back as evidence: the row of blocks built along South Water is why South Water looks
  built up in this layer, and nothing else.

Which layer a record is in is decided by `plat_occupancy.layer_of`, which asks the RECORD.
It used to be decided here, by the record's id prefix, and that reading misfiled
`physicians_office` — no prefix, and a product of the inferred-household programme all the
same (T-0221). `layer_of` and `LAYERS` are still importable from this module, because two
other tools take them from here, but the reading itself lives in one place now.

The centroid is the test rather than the whole footprint, because a footprint that laps a
25 m band is not thereby "on" that street, and because T-A13 used the centroid and this
tool exists to make its measurement repeatable rather than to replace it.
