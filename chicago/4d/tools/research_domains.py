"""One home and one gate for the six source domains beside the newspapers.

    tools/research_domains.py --build       write/normalise each domain's scaffold
    tools/research_domains.py --check       the gate
    tools/research_domains.py --self-test   the gate's assertions still fire when broken

WHAT THIS IS FOR. The project has exactly one research pipeline that works — the
newspapers' — and its shape is the reason it works: a register that says where a
passage IS, hand-authored claims that say what was read out of it, a CLOSED kind
vocabulary, a required reading grade, verbatim quotes the gate rebuilds out of the
committed text, a coverage declaration, and an identity layer that declares its
refusals as carefully as its merges.

Six more domains are about to be read in parallel — the civic lists, the 1830
census, the 1840 census, a church register, books and directories — by ten runs
that cannot see each other. If each invents its own file shape, the consolidation
(T-0513) spends its whole run re-reading ten dialects, and the refusals nobody
wrote down have to be made again. So the shape is fixed HERE, before the sweep
starts, and this file is the gate that holds it.

TWO SHAPES, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE SOURCE AND NOT THE DOMAIN.

  records — for a LIST. A voter roll, a census line, a baptism entry, a directory
            entry: one printed row, read as it stands (`as_read`) and again as this
            project spells it (`normalized`). A row is not a claim about the town;
            it is a claim about what the page says.

  claims  — for PROSE. A book paragraph that says something about 1835 Chicago.
            Same shape as the newspaper claims, because it is the same act: a
            `kind`, a verbatim `quote`, a `normalized` reading, the `entities` it
            names, and `town_finding` for whether it bears on the reconstruction at
            all — the reminiscence that is only about the author is worth recording
            and is not worth placing.

A domain may hold both. `books` and `directories` are the two the verbatim-quote
gate binds, because they are the two whose text this repo commits.

`data/research/` IS RESEARCH, NOT PAYLOAD, and this subtree inherits that: nothing
here is published, `tools/publish.sh` does not copy it, and
`tools/newspaper_corpus.py --check` already asserts the whole of `data/research/`
stays out of `site/chicago/4d/`.

NOTHING IN HERE AUTHORS A READING. --build writes empty scaffolds and a manifest;
the claims and the records are hand-authored, one ticket at a time, by the runs
this file exists to make consistent.

# THE images[] COVERAGE SHAPE, AND WHY THE GATE READS IT RATHER THAN REWRITING IT
#
# T-0536, and the ticket asked for the decision in writing, so here it is.
#
# `census_1840` declared its deposit before T-0492 fixed `declarations[]`, and it
# declared it RICHER: one object per page image, carrying the FamilySearch id, the
# sheet side, the printed page number, the line count, a `read_state` and a
# `page_file`. So the shared gate read zero declarations out of the domain that has
# been read the most, and either the tool learned that shape or the file was
# migrated to this one.
#
# THE GATE LEARNS `images[]`. Three reasons, in the order they bind:
#
#   1. The file is being appended to right now. T-0496 and the sheet-reading tickets
#      split out of T-0494 and T-0495 all extend this one document, on branches that
#      cannot see each other. Rewriting it underneath them loses readings in a merge,
#      and a lost reading is a sheet read twice.
#   2. `declarations[{unit, items[], ticket}]` has nowhere to put `read_state`,
#      `page_file` or `lines_with_an_entry` — and those three ARE the evidence that a
#      hole is a hole. The ticket forbids dropping a field to fit the shape.
#   3. `declarations[]` is a PROJECTION of `images[]`, not a rival to it: unit
#      `image`, items the FamilySearch ids, ticket the group's. A projection can be
#      derived, so nothing needs hand-migrating at all.
#
# THE DISTINCTION THAT MAKES THE HOLE ASSERTION MEAN SOMETHING is `read_state`. An
# image whose state is `inventoried_only` is declared as INVENTORIED — the sheet has
# been looked at and described and nothing has been read off it — and it is NOT
# asserted to be reached. Every other state declares the image READ, and a read image
# must name a committed `page_file` and be reached by a `pages/*.json`. Run together,
# the two states would make "declared" mean "seen", and a hole could never fire.
