"""The poll of 2 May 1837 against the four pools of 1835 names (T-0664).

The sibling of `crosswalk_fergus_1839.py`, and it imports that file's matching rule
rather than restating it, so the two cannot drift on the part that matters: SURNAME
must match after both are folded, AND the first initial of the given name must match.
A surname-only agreement is a REFUSAL. One 1835 name meeting more than one 1837 voter
is AMBIGUOUS and is filed as such; two 1835 people meeting one voter is CONTESTED and
no match is made.

WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS POOL, and it is the reason for a separate file. The 1839
directory gives a trade and a street, so a match there is enrichment. The 1837 poll
gives A WARD AND A VOTE, and nothing else — no trade, no address, no household. So a
match here carries exactly two things and they are both about 1837: the man was in
Chicago on 2 May 1837, and he was in that ward. Under the ratified grading ladder that
is CORROBORATION of continued residence for a person the project already holds, and it
is never, on its own, an 1835 resident.

A PROPOSAL. This file mints nobody and regrades nobody. T-0514 and T-0515 are the
passes allowed to write people; this is what they read.
