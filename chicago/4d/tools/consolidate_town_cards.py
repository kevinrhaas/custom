"""One person, several cards: the merge of the town's duplicate resident records.

WHY THIS EXISTS, in the owner's words (2026-09-05, reading data/residents/households
on dev): "do a review and consolidate of the residents, like James Allen is almost
certainly one record and he is spread across several, don't lose any data, but
consolidation is needed across the residents" — and, when the first draft of the ticket
stopped at a report, "make the ticket merge those records — research without
consolidation is useless".

WHAT WAS WRONG. Each source pass minted the name the way its source printed it and no
pass asked whether the town already had the man. `tools/consolidate_resident_evidence.py`
clusters SOURCE APPEARANCES into identities and marks which town cards each identity
absorbs, but its canonical card is town[0] and the merge is never proposed back onto the
cards — so a person the consolidation already knows is one identity stays several cards
for ever, and every pass that spends onto cards spends onto the wrong one or onto all of
them. Lieut. James Allen stood on four cards and only the one the ladder never reached
knew he was an army officer.

WHAT THIS TOOL DOES.
  1. DERIVES the candidate clusters: every group of town cards a surname-plus-compatible-
     forename test joins. Compatible means a full forename against the same word, an
     initial that the word begins with, or a card that prints a title and no forename at
     all — nothing looser. The candidate list is a WORKLIST, never a merge list: some of
     these are brothers, spouses, or a father and a son.
  2. Reads the WRITTEN RULING for every one of them from
     `data/residents/card_merge_rulings.json`, and refuses to pass its own gate while any
     card in a candidate cluster carries no ruling. That is the half that stops this
     recurring: a mint that re-splits an identity puts an unruled card in a cluster and
     `--check` goes red.
  3. LANDS the merges. A merge loses nothing:
       * the folded record is copied WHOLE to `data/residents/merged/<id>.json` with a
         `merged_into` block, so every byte of it is still in the tree and readable;
       * `index.json` grows a `merged` redirect table, so every `person_id` any file
         cites — the crosswalks, identity_master.json, the smoke cohorts, the placed-
         resident parcels — still resolves to a person;
       * `data/research/residents/card_merge_crosswalk.json` is the LANDED ADJUDICATION.
         `consolidate_resident_evidence.py`'s `declared_anchors()` reads every
         `*crosswalk*.json` under data/research/ and moves the anchored appearances onto
         the identity that holds the named person. So the folded cards' sources arrive on
         the survivor through the project's own machinery, the ladder regrades the joined
         identity, and `mint_civic_residents.py` refuses to re-mint the folded card
         because its identity now has a canonical person the pass does not own. Nothing
         here is a special case bolted beside the derivation; it is a ruling the
         derivation reads.
       * where the survivor is a HAND-AUTHORED card — the Andreas-derived records that no
         mint pass owns and no derivation will therefore spend onto — the union is written
         here: the folded cards' sources and evidence blocks, and a `merged_from` block
         naming what came from where.
  4. Writes the DISTINCT and UNDECIDED rulings onto the cards themselves, as a
     `merge_ruling` block, so the next pass reads the answer instead of re-asking.

    tools/consolidate_town_cards.py --report       the clusters and their rulings
    tools/consolidate_town_cards.py --candidates   write the ledger only
    tools/consolidate_town_cards.py --apply        land the rulings
    tools/consolidate_town_cards.py --check        the gate
    tools/consolidate_town_cards.py --self-test    the assertions still fire when broken
