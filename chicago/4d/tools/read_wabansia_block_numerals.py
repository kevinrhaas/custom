"""Read Wabansia's block numerals off Wright's 1834 survey, on a column grid nobody had.

WHAT THIS FILE IS AND IS NOT. It is the READING: which figure Wright writes in which cell
of Wabansia's block grid, the crop on the sheet where each was read, and the ruled lines
that make the cell. It authors NO ground. Every number below is a PIXEL statement about
chicago/pre_fire_v1/maps/images/1834-wright-map.jpg; seating Wabansia on modern ground is
T-1070's, and nothing here should be read as having done it.

WHY THE GRID COSTS SOMETHING HERE, WHERE IT COST NOTHING IN KINZIE'S ADDITION. T-1061
could read the Addition cell by cell because T-1060 had already committed its eleven
street corridors, so a cell was the rectangle two of them leave. Wabansia has half of
that: T-1068 committed the seven EAST-WEST corridors — Free, Trade, Sailors, Hight,
Owen, Hubbard, Kinzie — and refused the north-south ones, because the discrimination it
used (Wright letters a street's name inside its corridor) has nothing to say about
streets he does not letter, and the width test that would have to stand in its place is
the one this tract defeats. So the tiers are imported from
data/traces/wabansia_streets.json and the COLUMNS are measured here, by the only test
this tract leaves: a north-south rule is a line that appears in EVERY tier at the same
place, drifting east with the tract's own 0.011 px/px tilt. A lot line does that too, and
is kept and marked as one; a numeral's stroke does not.

WHAT THE READING SETTLES, and it is more than the ticket asked. Wabansia's block grid
holds TWENTY-ONE blocks in three columns of seven, and they are numbered 59 to 79 — a
closed run, every number once, none missing:

        west column      middle column    east column
    t1      79                66               65      (north, at the tract boundary)
    t2      78                67               64
    t3      77                68               63
    t4      76                69               62
    t5      75                70               61
    t6      74                71               60
    t7      73                72               59      (south, on Kinzie Street)

which is a boustrophedon read the other way round from the Addition's: it STARTS at the
tract's south-east corner, at Kinzie Street beside the North Branch, runs north up the
east column to 65, turns west and runs south down the middle column to 72, turns west
again and runs north up the west column to 79 at the north-west corner.

THE RUN DOES NOT BEGIN AT 1, and that is the finding worth carrying out of here.
Kinzie's Addition, on this same sheet, is numbered 1-54 (T-1061,
data/traces/kinzie_addition_block_numbering.json). Wabansia begins at 59. Fifty-five to
fifty-eight are in neither reading. This file does NOT claim Wright numbered the sheet
continuously across two surveys — that is a claim about intent and it has no evidence
here. It records the arithmetic and names the only two pieces of ground on this sheet
that could hold four more blocks, both of them open tickets: the Addition's river-front
water lots (T-1063) and the unidentified tract north of Kinzie Street lettered Michigan
St (T-0796). Wabansia's own water-lot triangle is not a candidate: its parcels are
numbered from 1 in a run of their own, which is T-1075's to read.

THREE THINGS THE SHEET DOES THAT A REGULAR GRID WOULD NOT, all measured, none explained:

  * THE JOG. The north-south street between the middle and east columns stands at
    x 957-989 in tiers 1-3 and at x 1035-1076 in tiers 4-7. It steps 78 px — about 54 m —
    EAST at Sailors Street, and the two columns change from one lot wide to two lots wide
    on the same line. The street widens across the step too — 22.6 m north of Sailors
    Street against 28.5 m south of it, where the street between the west and middle
    columns holds 21-22 m the whole way down. North of Sailors Street the North Branch is
    close enough to the grid to leave room for nothing wider.
  * THE NORTH TIER IS SHORT. The tract's north boundary rule runs at y 958, leaving tier 1
    a depth of 106 px against the 128-139 px the tiers below hold — three lot rows, not four.
    Wright's lot figures in tier 1 start at 2, which is the same fact written in his hand.
  * THE WEST MARGIN. Between the tract's west boundary rule and the west column's own
    west rule there is a strip 16-23 px wide, about 12-17 m. That is too narrow for a
    street on this sheet, where T-1068's seven measured corridors run 21-29 m, and no
    figure stands in it. Wright draws the two so close that the rule detector T-1060 left
    behind returns them as one fat blob, which is why `--check-sheet` tests peaks and not
    rules. It is recorded and NOT named; T-1070, which seats the tract, is where it has
    to be settled.

WHAT IS NOT READ, and is somebody else's, not a gap to fill by guessing: the lot figures
inside each block (1-8 in the two-lot-wide blocks, 1-4 in the one-lot-wide ones, read
here only far enough to say which they are); the water-lot triangle (T-1075); the names
of the north-south streets, which Wright letters nowhere in this tract; and the seating
(T-1070).
