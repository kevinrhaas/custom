 * The queue-order gate's assertions, and proof they fire.

 * The cases are the three times the ranking was actually lost, not invented ones:
 * a branch cut before a re-rank (#801, which took the file from 415 lines back to
 * a 2026-08-30 revision), a band stripped and its tickets left at line 416 (#909),
 * and the same-day case that a date comparison would wave through — two re-ranks
 * happened on 2026-09-05 alone.
