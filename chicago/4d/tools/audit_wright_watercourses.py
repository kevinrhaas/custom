"""Count every watercourse Wright draws, on the whole 600 dpi sheet (T-0795).

The three Wright readings this project holds were each taken inside a WINDOW of
the BPL/Leventhal scan — the forks box, the harbour box. The National Archives /
Historic Urban Plans facsimile the owner added in 2026-09-05 is whole, and the
owner's ask was plain: *"where the various sloughs are."* So this walks the
entire sheet, counts what is drawn, and re-measures the three courses against it.

    tools/audit_wright_watercourses.py                  print the audit
    tools/audit_wright_watercourses.py --check-sheet    re-read the raster (needs PIL+numpy)
    tools/audit_wright_watercourses.py --write          write the trace
    tools/audit_wright_watercourses.py --check-properties   offline re-derivation (the gate)
    tools/audit_wright_watercourses.py --self-test      the gate's own assertions

TWO TIERS, the split `trace_river.py` and `check_wright_nara_registration.py`
already make. `--check-properties` re-derives every number in the committed JSON
from the committed JSON's own inputs — the fit, the centreline, the picks — and
needs nothing but the standard library, so it runs in the per-commit gate.
`--check-sheet` re-opens the 5050 x 6628 raster and re-measures; it needs Pillow
and numpy, which the gate does not have, so it stays the deliberate second tier.
