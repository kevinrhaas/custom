"""Read the four Chicago voter lists of 1833-1835 into the civic domain, and
crosswalk every entry to the residents layer (T-0493).

    tools/read_voter_lists.py --build    write the records, the crosswalk, coverage
    tools/read_voter_lists.py --check    re-derive and refuse a stale committed file

WHY THIS IS A TOOL AND NOT A HAND-TYPED FILE. `data/research/civic/README.md` says
the records here are hand-authored, and for a book that is right — somebody must
decide what a paragraph says. A POLL BOOK is not that. It is 345 printed rows in
one committed text file, and the only honest reading of row 214 is "whatever line
214 says". Typing them by hand would introduce exactly the class of error the
`as_read` field exists to exclude, and nothing downstream could tell a typo from a
19th-century spelling. So the rows are DERIVED, the derivation is re-run by the
gate, and a committed file that has drifted from the text fails.

WHAT IS STILL A JUDGEMENT, and therefore is not in here: which entry is which
resident. `--build` proposes matches under the written rules below and every one
of them is a rule, not a guess; the merges and the refusals it cannot decide are
carried to `crosswalk.json`, where a person has to look at them.

THE MATCHING RULES, in the order they are tried. They are deliberately meaner than
a genealogist would be, because this file feeds a MINT (T-0514) and a name that
gets into the town wrongly is very hard to get back out.

  1. SURNAME-ONLY IS ALWAYS A REFUSAL. `Blinn`, `Whistler`, `Pennozer` — the lists
     are full of families and a bare surname separates none of them. Same rule
     `research_domains.check_crosswalk` enforces, applied one step earlier.
  2. A match needs the surname AND a forename discriminator that AGREES: either
     the forenames are equal, or the entry's initials are consistent with the
     resident's forenames initial for initial. `W. H. Adams` reaches
     `William Hanford Adams`; `J. Calhoun` does not reach `Alvin Calhoun`.
  3. If more than one resident survives rule 2, the entry is a CANDIDATE and names
     its rivals. Two Marks Beaubien would both be wrong.
  4. An entry that reaches no resident but appears in the v1 workbook's bridge
     rows (`census_1835_bridge_candidates.json`) is a CANDIDATE against that row.
  5. Everything else is UNMATCHED, which is a finding and not a failure.

NOTHING HERE MINTS OR REGRADES A RESIDENT. T-0514 and T-0515 do that, from the
consolidation, under the owner's grading ladder recorded in T-0493.
