"""What each of the 170 printed lines of the 1 January 1834 return reaches (T-1010, out of T-1008).

WHAT THIS IS FOR.

T-0424 read the ninth printing of the Chicago post office's 1 January 1834 return at
the page image and counted it: 170 printed lines, set down in printed order in
`data/research/newspapers/letter_list_1834_01_01_printed.json`. T-0310 minted a cohort
of residents out of the SAME return, a year of loop-runs earlier, from the
transcriptions of two of its nine impressions. Nobody had ever put the two beside each
other, so the project could say how long the list is and it could say who it minted,
and it could not say WHICH LINES THOSE PEOPLE ARE — nor, therefore, how many of the
170 reach no card at all.

That is the measurement this pass makes, and it makes it as a ledger with one row per
printed line. It MINTS NOBODY. Minting is a different decision from reading (T-0424's
own words) and a different decision again from counting, and the ticket that owns the
mint is the one this file's counts are for.

HOW A PRINTED LINE IS TIED TO A NAME THE PROJECT EXTRACTED, in four rules, strongest
first, each recorded on the row as `tied_by` so that a tie can be argued with:

  `image`     the extraction's own entity carries `read_at_image.printed_line`. That
              tie was made at the scan by T-0424 and is simply read back here.
  `text`      the entity's normalized name and the printed line agree exactly, once
              both are folded (case, punctuation, the trailing letter-count digit and
              any [bracketed] illegible glyph dropped). Unique matches only.
  `spelling`  the two surnames are within one edit of each other and the forenames do
              not contradict — one initial against the same initial, or a forename
              against nothing. Two settings of ONE return differ by exactly this much
              (`Hutchins`/`Huchins`, `Forster`/`Forrister`), and a rule narrower than
              this leaves those lines looking unread when they are merely respelt.
  untied      everything else, INCLUDING every ambiguity. A line two entities could
              equally be, or an entity two lines could equally be, is left untied and
              listed, because a concordance that guesses is worse than one that counts
              its own gaps.

WHAT A ROW SAYS THE LINE REACHES. The four outcomes are the four things that can have
happened to a name on this list, and the pass derives all four rather than asserting
any of them — `minted` and `refused` come out of `mint_letter_list_residents.py`'s own
`mint()`, through the refusals as that pass applies them, so this ledger cannot drift
from the pass it describes:

  `minted`        the letter-list pass minted a household for it, named here.
  `held_already`  the register ties the name to somebody the town ALREADY holds on
                  other evidence, so the line reaches a card that is not this cohort's.
                  A line that reaches Lewis Kercheval reaches Lewis Kercheval.
  `refused`       the name was in the mint's pool and a named refusal turned it away.
                  Not a gap: a ruling.
  `unread`        nothing the project has extracted from any of the nine impressions
                  carries this line. THIS is the gap the cohort's floor is made of.

THE THREE LINES THAT ARE NOT A PERSON are marked as what they are, from the roster's
own reading rather than from a rule here: `Axtel & Steele` and `Jesse B. Winn & Co.`
are firms, and `Lamira & Laura Carrier` names two people on one line. The printed
length is 170 LINES either way; what they are worth in PEOPLE is a different number,
and `counts.people_named` states it.

WHERE THE TWO READINGS OF A NAME DISAGREE, the row carries both (`printed_as` against
`extracted_as`) under `name_differs`, and where the line reached a card the card's own
spelling stands beside them. A corrected claim over an uncorrected card is worse than
neither (T-1008), and this is the list of the places where that could be true.
