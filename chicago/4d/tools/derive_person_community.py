"""The community of every person in the 1835 layer, read off what the layer already says.

    python3 tools/derive_person_community.py              write data/residents/community.json
    python3 tools/derive_person_community.py --check      it re-derives; nothing has drifted
    python3 tools/derive_person_community.py --report     rule by rule, what fired and what did not
    python3 tools/derive_person_community.py --self-test  the rules below, held over what it derives

WHY THIS EXISTS. T-1177 asked for the under-documented cohorts of 1835 — the Native and
Metis town, the free Black residents and their businesses, the Irish and German Catholic
town the register implies — to be identified, tiered and reviewable. Its first acceptance
clause is the one everything else stands on: a `community` attribute on every person and
household, drawn from a closed vocabulary, each value tiered, and filterable in the
People view. Without it there is nothing to filter and no share to measure against, so
T-1375 is that clause and nothing else.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, said plainly because the ticket it came from is about people the
record has wronged. This pass READS NO SOURCE. It mints nobody, upgrades no confidence,
invents no citation and writes no name. Every value it assigns is read off a field that is
already committed, and is graded no higher than that field. Where the layer holds nothing,
the answer is `unknown` and stays `unknown` — a majority of this town, and the honest
number the cohort tickets exist to shrink. T-1376 reads the Native and Metis sources,
T-1377 the free Black ones, T-1378 the businesses and the Irish and German shares.

THE THREE RULES, in the order they fire, each named on the record it writes.

  1. `reconstruction_community` — a reconstructed person drawn from one of the name pools
     of data/reconstruction/1835_invented_name_pools.json carries that pool's community on
     the card already (`persons[].reconstruction.community`). It is taken as it stands, at
     tier `reconstructed`, because the person is reconstructed. The pool named
     `french_colonial` resolves to the vocabulary's `french_canadian` through the rules
     file's alias table; no record is rewritten for a rename.

  2. `stated_community` — the household's `origin` sentence states a community or a
     descent rather than only a place: "his father an Irish officer in the British army,
     his mother Potawatomi"; "of a French colonial family". The tier is the origin block's
     OWN confidence, uncapped, because the sentence is the evidence. A stated descent
     speaks only for the head and the relations who share those parents — a wife does not
     take her husband's descent.

  3. `origin_region` — the household's `origin` states a place. A place is not a community,
     so this is an inference about the person and the tier is the origin block's confidence
     CAPPED AT `inferred`: an attested Vermont origin yields an inferred `yankee`. It
     speaks for the household's family and for nobody else under its roof — not the
     boarder, the lodger, the servant, the clerk, the apprentice, the journeyman or the
     unnamed `household_member`.

  And where none fires, `unknown`, with the basis saying which silence it was: the
  household records no origin, the origin is one this project has decided it cannot read
  into a community, or this person is not one the household's origin speaks for.

THE COVERAGE RULE IS THE SAFETY PROPERTY. Every distinct `origin.value` in
data/residents/ must be accounted for exactly once in data/residents/community_rules.json
— as a stated community, as a region, or as explicitly unreadable. `--check` fails when
one is not, so a new origin string cannot enter the layer without somebody deciding what
it means. A silent fall-through to `unknown` is exactly the failure this pass would
otherwise make invisible.
