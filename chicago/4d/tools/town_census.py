"""The two numbers the gate screen shows: buildings standing, people housed.

T-0036, the owner's ask of 2026-08-17 — *"on the front screen, show the number of
buildings in the city and the population, people living in their buildings"*, and the
population *"should get to the correct Chicago 1835 population number as the buildings
all complete"*.

**This is a read, not an invention.** Both numbers already exist in committed data and
neither is typed here:

* **Buildings standing** is the 665-roof programme's own standing count
  (`data/reconstruction/1835_665_roof_programme.json`, itself derived by
  `tools/reconcile_665.py` from the structure records). The programme counts PHYSICAL
  ROOFS, not records — a bridge, a pier, a palisade and a parade ground are structure
  records that are not buildings — and where a record's source reads as two or three
  cabins the ledger takes the low reading. This takes the same low reading, for the same
  reason: the two figures must not be able to disagree.
* **People housed** is `data/residents/` joined through `lives_at`. A person counts when
  the building they live in STANDS: the household's `lives_at` must name a structure that
  resolves into the scene (`data/sidecars/<year>/index.json`, which is what the renderer
  actually loads). So the number grows as the town builds out, by construction, exactly
  as the ask describes — a household whose dwelling has not been built yet is in the
  dataset and not in this count.

**Why a derived file and not a constant in the page.** `data/reconstruction`'s own
build.json lesson: a number written once by hand goes stale silently, and a stale number
on the FRONT screen is the most visible possible place to be wrong. `tools/check.sh`
re-derives this file, so a run that builds ten roofs and does not regenerate it fails at
the commit rather than shipping a town that says it is smaller than it is.

**What the numbers are NOT, stated here because the gate has no room to say it.**

* `people_housed` counts PERSON ENTRIES, and three of the entries it counts stand for
  groups nobody named — "the rest of the Beaubien household, unnamed", "Heacock's wife
  and children", "the rest of the Robinson household". Each is at least one person and
  probably several, so the figure is a FLOOR on the people this dataset houses, never a
  population estimate. `group_entries` carries the count so a reader can see the seam.
* The town's own total is 3,265 people in 398 dwellings — Andreas vol. 1, printed p. 180,
  the town census of **November** 1835, four months after the scene date. It is the town's
  recorded size and never the scene's population on 1 July; it stays in this file as the
  record it is, and the gate does NOT fill toward it (T-1365). What the gate fills toward
  is `people.scene`, below.

**`people.scene`, and why the gate needed it (T-1365).** The gate read `1,588 named
residents of roughly 3,265 who lived here`, and neither half of that sentence was sound.
The DENOMINATOR was the November count, which the note in this very file forbids reading
as the scene's population, and which the town model has since resolved to a point of 2,536
within 2,353–3,265 — so the front screen and the reconstruction programme were filling
toward two different towns. The NUMERATOR was every card in the residents index, most of
which are people the project has not established in Chicago on 1 July at all: a name on a
post-office letter list is a card, not a resident of that Tuesday. `people.scene` counts
the two ends the same way — persons in households recorded `present` on the scene date,
against the model's point for that date — and carries `cards_total` beside them so the
cards the layer holds are still stated, as cards.

**And the people it counts APART.** T-1353 mints the summer crowd of 1835 — the strangers
the Chicago American put OUTSIDE its own population estimate — as reconstructed visitors in
`data/residents/transients/`. They are not residents and they do not touch either figure
above: their cards carry no `lives_at`, they are not in the manifest this file joins, and
the `transients` block below reports them on a row of their own. Chicago's own enumerator
did the same thing in 1843, printing `Transient persons` as a separate line of his table.
