T-1159. The research spend was, correctly, conservative. The T-1143 ledger holds thousands
of units it refused, dated later than the scene, or placed outside Chicago, and the resident
layer carries hundreds of households whose presence on 1 July 1835 is `uncertain`. Those
refusals are NOT overturned here — a refusal was a ruling about EVIDENCE and it stands.

What changes is who the refusals are shown to. A name the corpus PRINTED is a better
reconstructed resident than a name drawn from an invented pool, so the reconstruction band
(T-1167 onward) must be offered the corpus's own names first, each with its evidence limit
stated. This file builds that offer.

IT MINTS NOBODY. No card, grade, presence or ledger disposition is written, read back or
changed by this tool: it reads the ledger and the resident layer and writes one derived
table. Every row says what reconstruction MAY do with it, and the `R0_ineligible` class
says `never`.

THE ACCOUNTING RULE. EVERY ledger unit is either (a) the origin of one or more roster rows
or (b) listed under `not_a_person_unit` with the reason it names no candidate. No unit is
silently dropped, and `--check` re-derives the whole table, so a unit that starts naming a
person tomorrow cannot vanish from this file quietly.

AND THE UNIT OF WITHHOLDING IS THE NAME, NOT THE CLAIM (T-1367). Until this ticket the rule
above read "every NON-ASSERTED unit", and an `asserted` unit was skipped whole. But the
research ledger's unit is the CLAIM, and a claim that prints fourteen names is asserted the
moment ONE of them reaches a card — so the other thirteen left this file without a word,
carried off by a spend that never touched them. That is the opposite of what this roster
says it is: a name the corpus printed and no card carries is a withheld name whether or not
some OTHER name in the same paragraph was spent. Measured on this branch, 2026-09-19: 798
asserted units hid 148 such names, 147 of them R2 and one R6 — nine of them off Moses and
Kirkland's spring-1833 list, which T-1366 had asserted the day before while recording in
`arrival_supersessions.json` that no name would move. They had already moved.

So asserted units are read like any other. Their names that a card carries fall to R0 under
the rules that already say so; their names that no card carries stay offered, under a rule
of their own that says the unit was spent on somebody else. This is what let T-1367 spend
the Baptist catalogue of 19 October 1833 onto three cards without dropping the twelve names
it reaches nobody with.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- the crosswalk merges

# A crosswalk MERGE is the project's written ruling that two spellings are one person.
# This roster keys the resident layer by the name a source PRINTS, so a read name a merge
# joined to a card spelt otherwise misses that index and is offered for re-admission
# beside the card that already holds the person — the Baptist catalogue's
# `Martin D. Harmon` against `hh_harmon_m_d`, which is the exact double-mint rule 1 of
# `classify` exists to prevent (T-1379, found by T-1367).
#
# READ THE MERGES AND NOTHING ELSE. A crosswalk's REFUSALS are the opposite ruling — the
# catalogue's Peter Moore was weighed against Henry Moore and refused — and a refused name
# is not carried by anybody's card, so it stays offered. The key test is the one
# `consolidate_resident_evidence.py` already makes over this same corpus: a list-valued
# key whose name carries "merge" and does not carry "refus".
#
# A MERGE IS SYMMETRIC, and the declared direction of `into`/`from` is not uniform across
# the corpus: `books/crosswalk.json` writes the card's name into `into`, while
# `newspapers/identity.json` writes the printed form there (`A[n]drew W. Borland` into
# `Andrew W. Borland`). 119 pairs name the card on one side, 11 on the other. Reading only
# one side would carry 11 of them and miss the rest for a convention neither file promises,
# so both sides are read: whichever spelling the layer holds, the other is that card's.
