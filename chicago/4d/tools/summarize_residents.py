"""What the residents and households look like — every figure, re-derived on demand.

T-0517. The owner asked for "a summary of what the residents and households look
like"; `docs/RESEARCH/residents-households-summary-2026-09.md` is that summary, and
this tool is what makes it a MEASUREMENT rather than a snapshot. Every table in the
doc names the section of this tool that prints it, so a later run can re-run the
command and see whether the number still holds.

    python3 tools/summarize_residents.py            # every section
    python3 tools/summarize_residents.py grades     # one section
    python3 tools/summarize_residents.py --list     # the section names

It READS and never writes. The inputs are the committed layer itself —
`data/residents/index.json` and the household records it manifests,
`data/town_census.json`, `data/research/residents/identity_master.json` and the
gated audit table at `chicago/reference/resident-research/final/audit/`. Nothing
here judges: the one judgement in the programme, which category a source id
belongs to, is made once in `tools/export_resident_audit.py` and read back from
its CSV.
