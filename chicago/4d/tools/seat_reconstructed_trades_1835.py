"""THE STAFFING JOIN, RECONSTRUCTED HALF: where the people nobody named worked.

T-1433, piece 2 of 3 of T-1189.

    tools/seat_reconstructed_trades_1835.py --build       write persons[].employment
    tools/seat_reconstructed_trades_1835.py --check       re-derive, refuse drift
    tools/seat_reconstructed_trades_1835.py --self-test   the guards, fired on the real data

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. T-1432 carried across every workplace a SOURCE names: 144 rows,
110 cards. It said so itself, and named this ticket for the rest. The rest is 524
people — the residents this project RECONSTRUCTED, each given a trade by the town
model and not one of them given anywhere to follow it. A card that says `carpenter`
and nothing else is a trade with no town attached to it, and 524 of them is most of
the working population of the reconstructed town.

WHAT IT WRITES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO WRITE. One derived file,
`data/residents/reconstructed_seating.json`, holding one block per reconstructed
trade-holder who has no `workplaces`. It mints NOBODY, raises no business, and moves no
person: the seat is a POINTER from a card the layer already holds to a house the layer
already holds, drawn by a stated rule and reproducible from the seed it carries. Where
no house can be pointed at, the block says that instead, in the words of the ruling
that decided it — a stated absence, never a blank.

AND SINCE T-1489 IT ALSO PUTS THE SEAT ON THE PERSON'S OWN CARD, as one key,
`persons[].employment`, and only for the `seated` answer. It did not, and the reason it
did not was a real one: two thirds of the people in scope stand on cards a
reconstruction STAGE owns whole — `reconstruct_trade_households.py` derives its 308
cards and its `--check` compares each one byte for byte against what the stage derives,
and the garrison, the women and children, the free Black cohort, the boarders and the
re-admissions all do the same for theirs. A later pass appending a key to one of those
cards did not add a field, it broke that stage's gate, so the key stopped at
`households/` and 90 of the 123 seated people said nothing about work on their own
card while the join beside them said where they worked.

THE FIX IS THE ONE THE LAYER ALREADY USES FOR `workplaces`, not an exception carved for
this pass. `tools/staff_businesses_1835.py` writes `workplaces` after every mint has
run, and `tools/resident_mint_carry.py` gives the four `households/` mints a fixed slot
that CARRIES it through their next re-derivation, so the byte comparison stays a byte
comparison and the foreign key survives. T-1489 extends that module with the same fixed
slot for `employment` and hands the four stages that derive a directory whole —
`reconstruct_trade_households.py`, `reconstruct_underdocumented.py`,
`reconstruct_free_black.py` and `reconstruct_women_children.py`, whose own `hh_rc_*`
cards stand inside `households/` and hold 33 of the seats — one call, `carry_seats()`,
that does it for a whole set at once. The three directories no stage was given a call
for — `lodgers/`, `transients/`, `readmitted/` and `merged/` — hold no seat today, and
if one ever lands there the stage that drops it fails `verify_cards` below by name
rather than quietly: a seated person whose own card is silent is an assertion here, not
a warning. Two gates then own one field between them and neither is weakened:
the stage still refuses a differing byte in everything IT derives, and `--check` here
is the sole authority for what the `employment` block says, asserted both ways — a
block on a card this pass does not seat is a fossil, and a seated person whose card is
silent is a card that has lost its answer.

The join itself is unchanged and is still the record of the OTHER four answers, which
no card carries because they are statements about an absence. It lives beside the layer
keyed on `person_id`, in the same idiom as `residents/directories.json` and
`residents/person_facts_withheld.json` — a derived join the walkthrough loads and can
lose without losing the card.

WHY `employment` AND NOT `workplaces`. `workplaces` is T-1432's field and T-1432's
gate asserts it BOTH ways: an entry there with no business record naming that person
back is a fossil and the gate fails on it. That assertion is worth more than the
convenience of one field, because it is the thing that keeps the attested join honest.
A reconstructed seat is the other kind of claim — nobody named it, this project drew
it — so it gets the other word, and the two can never be read as one. The business
side of the join, the `staff[]` row that would make a seat visible from the house,
is T-1434's: it mints the shortfall the model still says is missing, and a business
card that printed a reconstructed hand before the shortfall was minted would be a
half-filled house reading as a full one.

THE FIVE ANSWERS. Every person in scope gets exactly one, and each is a different
statement about the evidence:

  `seated`                  the staffing model names a class of house that employed
                            this trade, the layer holds such a house at the scene
                            date, and it has room in its band. The block names the
                            house, the role and the term of the order rule that chose
                            it.
  `class_held_no_house`     the model names the class and the layer holds no house of
                            it trading on 1 July 1835, or every one of them is full to
                            the band's high end. The block names the class and the
                            count.
  `keeps_their_own_house`   the premises ruling says this trade kept premises of its
                            own and the model does not employ it in anybody else's.
                            A seat would demote a principal to a hand. The house is
                            owed, and the block says which ticket owes it.
  `no_employer_named`       the premises ruling says the trade kept no premises of its
                            own AND the model employs it nowhere — the soldier at the
                            post, the laundress over her own tub, the farmer on his own
                            ground. The block carries the ruling's own words for why.
  `no_ruling`               the trade is in the resident layer's occupation vocabulary
                            and `premises_rulings.json` has never ruled on it. Five
                            people stand here and the block says so rather than
                            guessing; T-1404 owns the ruling.

THE ORDER RULE, AND WHICH OF ITS TERMS ACTUALLY BITES TODAY. The ticket asks for the
nearest house of the trade in the person's own division, seeded. That is three terms
and they are applied in that order, but two of them are INERT against the data as it
stands and the report counts exactly how often each one decided a seat, so the day
they start biting is visible rather than assumed:

  1. DIVISION. A business record carries no `division` today and that is not an
     oversight — `tools/build_order_book_1835.py` says it in the book: "EVERY BUSINESS
     BUCKET IS `unassigned` BY DIVISION TODAY ... assigning premises to a division is
     T-1182's audit and T-1198's seating." This tool reads the field and does not
     invent it. Deriving one from the street would be that audit performed by a tool
     with no licence for it, and it would be wrong besides: Lake Street runs from local
     easting -320 to +900 and crosses the South Branch, so half the register's street-
     only premises sit on lines that straddle a division line.
  2. NEAREST. Both ends must resolve to committed coordinates. 30 of 197 business
     records name a structure; 12 of 414 reconstructed households are seated at one,
     because seating them is T-1198's and T-1199's and both stand below this ticket in
     the queue. So this term decides the few it can and stands aside for the rest.
  3. THE SEEDED DRAW. What is left: a deterministic order over the candidate houses,
     keyed on the person, the trade and the house. It is a draw and the block says it
     is a draw — `chosen_by` carries the term that decided, so no reader has to take
     the tool's word for which one did.

CAPACITY IS THE MODEL'S, NOT THIS TOOL'S. A house may take no more hands in a role
than `count_high` for that role in its class. That bound is why `class_held_no_house`
exists at all: 23 reconstructed dressmakers against the one dressmaking house the
register carries is not a shop with 23 hands in it, it is a town owed more shops, and
the report says how many.
