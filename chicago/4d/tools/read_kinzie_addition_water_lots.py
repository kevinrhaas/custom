    tools/read_kinzie_addition_water_lots.py --check-sheet  re-open the raster and re-read it

A LOT STRIP IS NOT A BLOCK GRID, and that is the whole point of reading it
separately. Everything else Wright plats north of the river is a module — a tier
pitch and a column pitch, two families of parallel rules, blocks between them.
The ground between the Addition's south tier and the water is not that: it is one
run of narrow parcels laid side by side against a curving bank, each as wide as
the draughtsman needed and as deep as the bank left room for, numbered straight
through from the Original Town's line to the lake. Fitting a grid to it would
invent regularity the sheet does not draw. So this reading carries the run's own
geometry — a front line, a back line, the division strokes between the parcels —
and reports what a lot strip has instead of a module: a frontage per lot, and the
spread of those frontages.

THE SHEET is the National Archives / Historic Urban Plans facsimile registered as
`wright_1834_nara_hup` (5050 x 6628 px at 600 dpi), the same raster and the same
affine `tools/read_kinzie_addition_streets.py` reads the Addition's streets on, so
the two readings can be subtracted from each other without a scan-to-scan hop.

HOW THE RUN IS FOUND. Nothing here is picked off a crop by eye except one seed
point and one bearing. From that seed a tangential follower walks the strip's
FRONT line — the drawn river bank, which is the strongest continuous stroke in
this corner of the sheet — one pixel at a time, re-centring on the darkest line
within two pixels of its projected step and turning by a damped fraction of the
correction. That walk defines an arc-length coordinate `s` along the run and a
perpendicular coordinate `t` northward from the front line, and everything below
is measured in that frame.

HOW A DIVISION STROKE IS TOLD FROM A NUMERAL. Both are ink inside the strip, and
a profile that sums darkness cannot tell them apart — Wright's figures are as
black as his rules. What separates them is that a division stroke crosses the
WHOLE depth of the parcel and a figure does not. So the observable here is the
MINIMUM darkness over the depth band rather than the sum: a stroke scores high
because it is dark at every t, a figure scores near zero because it is blank
above or below itself. The strokes also lean — hard, in the wedge east of the
bend, where they stand square to the back line rather than to the bank — so the
minimum is taken over a small fan of shears and the best-scoring shear is kept
and reported with each division.

WHAT THIS READING SETTLES AND WHAT IT REFUSES. It settles the run's shape, its
length, where each division stands, and therefore how many parcels the sheet
draws and how wide each is relative to its neighbours. It does NOT settle the
absolute width of a lot in feet on the ground: the NA fit carries 16.19 m RMS and
its two axis scales differ by 5.2 per cent, so a frontage is reported both raw and
scaled by the factor the committed street reading measured for this method against
the Original Town's platted 80 ft corridors on this same sheet. And it refuses the
figures: at this scan's resolution the terminal run and the three parcels east of
the break are legible and the rest are not. What the reading does instead is
COUNT, and the count closes — see `numbering` below.
