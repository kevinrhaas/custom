"""THE 1835 BUSINESS RECONSTRUCTION — one writer, five groups, one quota.

    python3 tools/reconstruct_businesses_1835.py --group stores_and_provisions --build
    python3 tools/reconstruct_businesses_1835.py --check          # every built group
    python3 tools/reconstruct_businesses_1835.py --self-test

T-1184 builds this and T-1185 … T-1188 reuse it. The five reconstruction tickets of the
business band differ in exactly one thing — WHICH ROWS OF THE ORDER BOOK THEY OWN — and the
order book already says which, on every bucket, in `owning_ticket`. So a group here is a key
and a ticket number, the classes are READ from the book rather than restated, and a ticket
that re-cuts the book moves this tool's quota with it. Nothing about the quota lives in this
file; what lives here is the rule for turning a quota row into a house of trade.

WHAT A RECONSTRUCTED BUSINESS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. It is a firm the December 1835 State
census counts and the newspaper register does not hold: the census prints four druggists and
the register carries two, so the town of 1 July 1835 had two apothecaries' shops nobody
wrote the name of. This tool writes those two. It is NOT a reading, it carries no source, it
may never be promoted, and every field on it names the rule that drew it and the evidence
that would retire it — `reconstruction.basis`, `reconstruction.seed`, `replaceable_by`.

THE PROPRIETOR IS ADOPTED, NEVER MINTED. `tools/reconstruct_residents_1835.py` is the one
writer of a person graded `reconstructed` and this tool is deliberately not a second one.
The resident band's `trade_households` stage (T-1347, of T-1173) already drew heads at the
trades the town was short of, and every one of those cards says so itself: "the business
band (T-1184 … T-1188) ADOPTS these heads as its proprietors rather than minting its own, so
the two bands fill one quota." A group whose class orders more houses than that band drew
heads for is REFUSED here rather than quietly under-filled — the shortfall is the resident
band's to draw, and a business tool that minted its own proprietor would order the same
person twice.

THE STYLE IS PERIOD OR IT IS NOTHING. `docs/RESEARCH/business-naming-1835.md` is the guide,
written from the 196 firm styles the register prints, and STYLES below is its executable
half. A reconstructed firm may not reuse an attested firm style, an attested house's name,
or an attested proprietor's name; `--check` refuses each.

THE LOCATION IS A LIMIT. Every record here takes a `street_only` location on a face the
placement rule allows for its class and division — no lot, no roof, no coordinate. T-1195
writes the placement policy properly and T-1199 seats these houses on the lot grid; until
then the face is a deal off a stated rule and the `limit_reason` says exactly that.

# ------------------------------------------------- the second quota: a roof, not a count
#
# THE ORDER BOOK CANNOT ORDER A BOARDING HOUSE, and that is a property of the census
# rather than a hole in the book. `business_buckets` in tools/build_order_book_1835.py
# orders against PRINTED COUNTS or not at all, and the December 1835 State census
# enumerates taverns — eight of them, all attested, and the town keeps eight — while it
# never enumerates a boarding house at all. So no shortfall of this class can ever be
# counted, and the first quota has nothing to say about the one part of the lodging
# economy this town demonstrably had: the 1840 schedule's 8.2 people to a dwelling.
#
# What this project HAS already committed is the BUILDING. Five boarding houses stand in
# `data/structures/`; the lodging model (T-1370) apportioned each of them beds out of a
# bracket the town model owns; the lodgers stage (T-1371) put people in those beds and
# named a keeper for every reconstructed one. A house with beds, lodgers and a keeper and
# no firm behind it is an establishment the business layer cannot see — it does not appear
# in the Businesses view, its building card names no trade, and the keeper's own card can
# say she keeps a boarding house while nothing in the town holds one.
#
# So the roof is the quota. One record per STANDING reconstructed lodging roof of the
# class below, and never one for a slot the roof programme has scheduled and not built:
# the 37 unbuilt boarding houses are 333 beds with no roof over them (T-1196 re-derives
# the programme, T-1409 raises the houses) and a firm in a building site is a fiction of a
# different kind. The named houses are not touched either — who kept the New York House in
# 1835 is a research question, and the lodgers stage refused to answer it for exactly this
# reason; their keepers come from the register through T-1404.

        # against. Typing these houses `tavern` would spend the eight-tavern count the
        # register already fills; minting a class the census never printed would put a

# names. NO HONORIFIC IS DEALT. Three of the four keepers the lodgers stage drew are women,
# and `Mrs.` would assert a marriage, `Miss` a want of one; the cards carry neither, because
# the stage minted them as solitary keepers and nothing in the layer says which. A style
# that reached for the honorific would be inventing a marital status to make a sign read
# well — so the possessive stands on the name alone, which asserts only what the card holds.

# ------------------------------------- the third quota: a trade, not a count and not a roof
#
# THE ORDER BOOK CANNOT ORDER A LIVERY STABLE EITHER, and for the same reason it cannot
# order a boarding house: `business_buckets` orders against PRINTED COUNTS or not at all,
# and the December 1835 State census's eighteen lines reach the taverns, the stores and the
# saw-mill and never reach a livery stable or a lumber yard. But the roof form of T-1408
# does not rescue these two. A boarding house had a BUILDING already committed — beds
# apportioned, lodgers seated, a keeper named — and the firm was the only thing missing.
# Nothing in `data/structures/` is a livery stable. There is no roof to point at.
#
# What there IS, and what nothing else in this tool has yet spent, is THE HEAD. The
# resident band's `trade_households` stage drew two men at `livery_stable_keeper` and two
# at `lumber_merchant` — drawn because the 1839 trade table says the town was short of
# them, and every one of those cards says in its own `works_at` that the business band
# adopts these heads rather than minting its own. A head at one of those trades and no
# house behind it is the mirror image of T-1408's fault: there the building had no firm,
# here the KEEPER has no firm, and in both cases the business layer cannot see an
# establishment this project has already committed itself to.
#
# So the trade is the quota, and the rule is the meaning of the word. `livery_stable_keeper`
# names, inside the occupation itself, the thing kept; so does `lumber_merchant`, whose
# trade in this town is a YARD on the water — the register's one printed yard is "announced
# for the opening of navigation". A trade whose word names a house of trade orders one
# house per head. A trade whose word names an EMPLOYMENT — `teamster`, `boatman`, `seaman`,
# `sawyer` — orders nothing here; the man is somebody else's hand and T-1189 seats him.
# RIVER_AND_TRANSPORT below is that ruling written out, trade by trade, so that no head is
# passed over in silence: the ledger prints every one of them with the kind of absence it is.
#
# THE CLASS IS `other` AND MAY NEVER BE OTHERWISE. Typing a lumber yard
# `storage_and_forwarding` would spend a count the register already over-holds — four
# printed houses ordered, eight standing — exactly as typing a boarding house `tavern`
# would spend the eight-tavern count. `--check` refuses a trade row whose census class is
# one the order book enumerates, by name.
