"""T-1124 — a judgement that is simply GONE, which no derivation can see.

On 10 September 2026 the merge lap pushed onto #1055 and
`data/research/land_sales/resident_rulings.json` conflicted. The file is
`hand_authored`; the lap's regex resolution took the branch's whole block for the
second conflict, and that branch had been cut before T-0850 and T-0990 cohort A
ruled. Forty entries left the file on one line, and twelve resident cards silently
got back a federal land purchase each had been ruled it could not have. #1073
restored them. This is the reason nobody was told.

`check.sh` was green on #1055 and on every commit after it, and it was RIGHT to be.
`read_land_sales.py --check` asks whether a ruling is WELL FORMED — that it names a
spelling the register holds, and a person the proposal named — and every surviving
ruling was. The eight that were left re-derived perfectly into a crosswalk perfectly
consistent with them. **A smaller rulings file is a legal rulings file**, and that is
the general shape: every gate this repository has re-derives DOWNSTREAM of its
hand-authored evidence, and a derivation cannot see a shrinking input. It just
derives less.

So this asks the one question a derivation cannot: is every judgement that was here
before still here? Two readings of "still here", both required:

  * BY IDENTITY — every (purchaser_as_read, resident_id) pair adjudicated at the
    merge base is adjudicated at HEAD. This is the strong one: it catches a swap,
    where one judgement leaves and another arrives and the total never moves.
  * BY COUNT — the adjudicated total may not fall. Redundant while the keys are
    unique, and kept because it is the number a person reads, and because it is what
    the incident is remembered by: 49 -> 9.

`ruled[]` and `retired[]` are counted TOGETHER, so retiring a ruling is a MOVE and
not a loss.

THE COMPARISON IS AGAINST THE MERGE BASE, never against a number committed beside the
file. A branch that dropped forty entries and also edited a total downwards would
satisfy any self-consistent check; it cannot satisfy this one, because the figure it
is held to lives in git and not in the tree it is editing.

**A DELIBERATE REMOVAL IS STILL POSSIBLE AND MUST STATE ITSELF.** A judgement that
should never have been made does not get deleted — it moves to `withdrawn[]`, which
this counts alongside `ruled[]` and `retired[]` and which requires a `reason` and the
`ticket` that decided it, exactly the way `retired[]` already carries its reason. The
total therefore never falls, and the record of what left says why. That is the same
trade the liberty ledger and the refusal lists make everywhere else in this project.

    tools/check_rulings_not_lost.py              the gate (base defaults to origin/dev)
    tools/check_rulings_not_lost.py --base REF   hold it to a different base
    tools/check_rulings_not_lost.py --self-test  prove the refusal fires

TWO STATES, deliberately different — T-1083's lesson, that a gate may not count a
skip as a pass:

  * `C4D_GATE_REQUIRE_BASE=1` (the workflow sets it) — a base ref that will not
    resolve is RED. In CI it always resolves; `actions/checkout` is pinned to
    `fetch-depth: 0`, which fetches every branch.
  * unset (an agent sandbox, a laptop, a shallow clone) — the same absence is a
    WARNING that names what went unasked, and the gate goes on.

REGISTRY, below: one entry per guarded file. The mechanism is already general; what
each new file needs is a READING of which of its stores hold a judgement and which
hold a transcription. T-1124 shipped the mechanism with land sales alone in it and
left that reading to T-1125.

T-1125 DID THE READING, on the nine files `grep -rl 'hand_authored|do not hand-edit'
data/research/` found on dev, and on one file that grep could not have found. Five are
guarded and five are REFUSED — refusals are in `REFUSED` below with the reason each was
turned away, because a file left silently out of a registry reads exactly like a file
nobody has looked at yet. The refusals are not a backlog: four of the five are DERIVED,
and guarding a derivation against shrinking is the gate that cries wolf the moment its
generator legitimately derives less.

The one file the grep could not find: `card_merge_crosswalk.json` carries the
`hand_authored` marks, but `consolidate_town_cards.py` WRITES it from
`data/residents/card_merge_rulings.json`, and that — outside data/research/ entirely —
is where the owner's 64 written merge rulings actually live. So the crosswalk is refused
and the store behind it is guarded. A registry that had taken the crosswalk at its word
would have guarded a mirror and left the original open.

THREE STORE SHAPES, because the evidence files have three and a guard that only reads
lists would have had to skip the largest hand-authored correction file in the tree:

    "added_rows"            a list of objects — the common case
    "lots"                  a MAPPING keyed by what it rules on (fergus's 113 lot
                            corrections); the key is offered to `identity` as `_key`
    "clusters[].rulings"    a list nested one level in (the 64 merge rulings sit inside
                            50 clusters); a row reaches its parent's fields with `^`

IDENTITY IS A UNION ACROSS A FILE'S STORES, never per-store: the key of a judgement has
to mean the same thing in every array it could sit in, or moving one from `ruled` to
`withdrawn` would read as a loss and an arrival. So `identity` names every field that
identifies a judgement ANYWHERE in the file and each entry fills the ones it carries.
The self-test asserts the result is still unique per file — a collision would let a loss
hide behind a duplicate, so the union is checked and not assumed.
