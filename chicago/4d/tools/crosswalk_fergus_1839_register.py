"""The city register of 1839 and the mayors and sheriffs against the four pools of 1835
names (T-0665).

The sibling of `crosswalk_fergus_1839.py` and `crosswalk_fergus_1839_election.py`, and
it imports the first one's matching rule rather than restating it, so the three cannot
drift on the part that matters: SURNAME must match after both are folded, AND the first
initial of the given name must match. A surname-only agreement is a REFUSAL. One 1835
name meeting more than one register entry is AMBIGUOUS; two 1835 people meeting one
entry is CONTESTED and no match is made.

WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS POOL, and it is the reason for a separate file.

  * The 1839 directory gives a trade and a street, so a match there is enrichment.
  * The 1837 poll gives a ward and a vote.
  * THIS POOL GIVES AN OFFICE — and an office is the strongest single thing a name can
    carry, because it is the town saying who a man was, not a clerk writing down that
    he existed. A man who was city treasurer in 1839 is a man of standing in 1839, and
    if the project already holds him in 1835 that is a biography, not a coincidence.

  * AND THE TABLES REACH BACK BEHIND THE SCENE DATE, which nothing else in this volume
    does. The sheriffs of Cook County are printed from 1831: James Kinzie in 1831,
    Stephen Forbes in 1832, Silas W. Sherman in 1834 and 1836. A match on one of those
    four rows is not later evidence at all — it is a CONTEMPORARY office, held in or
    across the scene year, and the crosswalk marks it `reaches_scene: true` and says
    which years. That is the useful yield of these two pages and it is four rows wide.

WHAT A MATCH MAY NOT DO. Every row of the mayors' table and every line of the city
register postdates the scene: Chicago was not a city until March 1837. So a register
match is corroboration of CONTINUED RESIDENCE and nothing more, and under the ratified
grading ladder later evidence alone never makes an 1835 resident.

A PROPOSAL. This file mints nobody and regrades nobody. T-0514 and T-0515 are the
passes allowed to write people; this is what they read.
