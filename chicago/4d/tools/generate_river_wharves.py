"""Derive the town's river wharves from the records that state one.

    python3 tools/generate_river_wharves.py --check    re-derive and diff, write nothing

WHY THIS EXISTS. `docs/ROADMAP.md` K5 (e) asks for *"docks/wharves at the
forwarding houses"* and ticket T-0041 is that clause. Two records in this dataset
state a dock and both of them state it in the same sentence of the same dossier —
*"Kinzie & Hunter and Dole & Newberry each had a warehouse with its dock along the
river front"* (docs/research/03-structures-north.md §3.10) — and Andreas names
*"Newberry & Dole's wharf"* independently, as the place the schooner *Illinois*
was cheered on 12 July 1834 (scan p. 503). Until now BOTH docks carried
`geometry: "absent"`: the strongest chip this project hands out, over nothing at
all, in front of a bare bank. `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L66 recorded that as owed.

So the FACT of a wharf at these two frontages is the best-attested thing on this
layer, and every dimension of it is invented. That is `reconstructed` in this
project's third tier, which AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER says is a licence
to build rather than an admission of defeat.

THE RULE, and it is the whole answer to "why these frontages and no others":

    a sidecar standing on the scene date whose own `dock` attribute is true.

T-0041 shipped that rule with a grade clause — attested or inferred only, no
`reconstructed`, because a dock resting on a reconstructed dock read as an
invention on an invention — and it selected exactly two records. On 2026-08-18
the owner overruled the rationing, verbatim "you can add more docks!" (T-0062,
with the standing ruling in AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER), so five South
Water merchant records now STATE a reconstructed landing, each with its bound in
its own note, and this generator draws them. The selection still lives in the
data: a record with no dock statement — the Temple Building's meeting house on
the same frontage, the lumber landing, the ferry — still gets no wharf, and
"why this frontage" is still answered by a record rather than by this file.

WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS INVENTED — the division this file exists to keep
auditable:

  DERIVED, from committed data, no free numbers at all
    * the wall the wharf serves: the footprint's own max-`v` edge and the
      committed facade bearing, through `docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md`'s frame — the same
      three lines `tools/generate_business_signboards.py` composes.
    * WHERE the wharf stands: the traced 1834 bank line, nearest point to the
      middle of that wall. The deck runs ALONG the bank's own tangent, not square
      to the building — a wharf follows the river, and the two differ by 20° here.
      That bank is TWO TRACING WINDOWS of the Wright 1834 sheet joined at a seam
      they agree on to under a metre — `river.geojson` at the forks and
      `shoreline.geojson` through the harbour reach — which is the composition
      `terrain_spec.json` declares in `shore_runs`. See `bank_lines()`.
    * how deep the water is at its face, and how far it stands clear of the
      building it serves: sampled from the committed heightfield, reported rather
      than assumed, so what the invented outline implies is on the record.

  INVENTED, and every one of them is in `form` with its bound stated
    * how far out the face stands (6.0 m), how far the heel ties back into the
      bank (2.0 m), how far the deck runs past the building each way (3.0 m),
      the deck's thickness, its freeboard rule and its snubbing posts.

Nothing here is baked. A deck on cribs is a box on boxes standing on ground and
water this project already draws, so it is derived from committed numbers and
drawn at load by `renderers/web/js/wharves.js` — the argument that already lets
`data/enclosures/` draw a fence from a perimeter, `data/signage/` hang a board off
a wall and `data/yard/` stand a barrel on the footway. `tools/check.sh` re-derives
this file's output byte for byte, because "which frontage gets a wharf" is a rule
and a rule has to be auditable.

    THE BANK IS TWO TRACING WINDOWS, NOT ONE, AND THIS LAYER USED TO READ ONLY
    THE FIRST (T-0106). `tools/trace_river.py` works a 1120 px window of the
    Wright 1834 sheet centred on the forks, so the bank polylines it writes into
    `river.geojson` stop at local E +390 — where the WINDOW closed, not where the
    bank did. `tools/trace_shoreline.py` picks the same waterline up off the same
    sheet at E +314 and carries it east past the Dearborn drawbridge (E +699) to
    the lake, and `shoreline.geojson` has held that trace since 2026-08-10. The
    two windows overlap between E +314 and E +390 and AGREE THERE TO UNDER A
    METRE at the seam, which is what licenses reading them as one line.

    So nothing here is extended by eye and nothing new is traced: the run is the
    composition `terrain_spec.json` already declares in `shore_runs`, which is
    also how `generators/terrain_gen.py::build_field` measures a division's
    waterline — it takes the minimum distance over every run of that division,
    across both files. Two consumers of one waterline reading it two ways is how
    a river grows two banks; before this, the wharf layer believed the south bank
    ended 309 m short of the drawbridge and refused three stated landings for
    standing beyond a trace that was there all along.

    The join, stated so it cannot drift:

      1. the division's `river.geojson` run is taken WHOLE and oriented so its
         last vertex is the end nearer the harbour-reach run — no committed
         vertex is dropped, moved or resampled, so every wharf already standing
         keeps the bank foot it had;
      2. the harbour-reach run is oriented to continue away from that end;
      3. the foot of the forks run's terminal vertex is found on it, and only the
         vertices BEYOND that foot are appended. The overlap is therefore
         corroboration, never geometry — the seam offset is the distance between
         the two windows' readings of one bank and is reported in the record.

    `river.geojson` is EPSG:26916 and the scene is local ENU from
    `data/datum.json`'s origin, which is the one conversion this file makes.

    point on the bank, full stop, and on the forks-window trace — a smooth
    curve in front of a row of warehouses — the nearest point is always the
    bank the wall faces. The harbour-reach trace is not smooth: it carries
    re-entrants, and one of them is a 10 m-wide slot cutting 32 m into the
    south bank at local E +463. Peck's store fronts the river 29 m west of
    that slot, and the slot's tip is 30.3 m from its river wall against 41.2 m

    Clipping is done on SEGMENTS and not on vertices: the trace's vertices are
