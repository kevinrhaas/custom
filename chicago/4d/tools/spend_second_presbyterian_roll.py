"""The Second Presbyterian roll, spent on the people it names (T-0992).

    python3 tools/spend_second_presbyterian_roll.py             write the ledger and the cards
    python3 tools/spend_second_presbyterian_roll.py --check     everything re-derives; nothing drifted
    python3 tools/spend_second_presbyterian_roll.py --report    person by person, what the roll says
    python3 tools/spend_second_presbyterian_roll.py --self-test the rules below, held over what it derives

WHY THIS EXISTS. T-0962 widened the second hop of `tools/measure_research_spend.py` to read
the `matched` container, and the church domain entered that report for the first time: 83
rulings reached a person this town holds a card for, 83 were judgeable, and NOT ONE card
cited the roll. `grep -r second_presbyterian_chicago_1892 data/residents/` returned nothing.
The adjudication had been made — `data/research/church/second_presbyterian_crosswalk.json`
files 83 lines as `matched`, 37 as `ambiguous` and 330 as `refused` — and it had never
crossed into the town. This pass is that crossing, and nothing else.

WHAT THIS SOURCE IS, AND THE LIMIT THAT TRAVELS WITH IT. The roll is the 1892 printing of the
membership of the Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago, a church ORGANISED IN JUNE 1842 —
seven years after the scene this project reconstructs. Its admission dates run from
1842-06-01 to 1892-02-29; `second_presb_0371` is admitted 27 April 1859. An 1859 admission is
not 1835 evidence, and the crosswalk says so itself, in the file, in the sentence this pass
quotes onto every card rather than paraphrasing:

    "NOTHING. A line on a roll that opens in June 1842 cannot place a person in the town of
     July 1835, and this file makes no proposal that it does."

The ladder T-0505 ratified binds here exactly as it binds an 1840 head: the evidence is
handed to the card, the verdict is not.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT WRITTEN, in five rules — the first four are the rules
tools/spend_census_1840_heads.py and tools/spend_land_sales.py hold, unchanged, because the
defect they guard against is the same one. The fifth is this roll's own.

  1. ONLY WHAT THE CROSSWALK ALREADY DECLARED, and only `matched`. This pass re-adjudicates
     nothing. The 37 `ambiguous` and the 330 `refused` write NOTHING: a rival still standing
     is not a ruling to spend, and that is the line MATCH_CONTAINERS draws.

  2. TWO FIELDS AND NO OTHERS. A person gains the source id in `sources` and a paragraph in
     `note`. Nothing else is touched — not a grade, not an arrival, not a claim block, not a
     placement, and above all not `present_on_scene_date`. `--self-test` holds that by
     diffing a record through the applier and asserting the changed key set.

  3. NO GRADE MOVES. The crosswalk mints and regrades nothing and neither does its spend.

  4. ONE PARAGRAPH PER PERSON. The crosswalk matches a person to exactly ONE roll line —
     `residents_matched_one_line` is the count's own name for it — so a person is told once,
     and the paragraph names the line, its printed page and its record id.

  5. A WIFE'S LINE IS HER HUSBAND'S NAME, AND THE CARD IS TOLD SO. 34 of the 83 matched
     lines are flagged `a_married_womans_entry` — the roll prints `Cook, Mrs. J. L.`
     throughout — and the crosswalk's own Mrs rule says what such a line has met: "a line
     flagged a_married_womans_entry that meets a MAN in the 1835 layer has met his name, not
     him". Suppressing those matches would make them invisible; writing them without the
     caution would make them look like a person on a roll. So the flag travels onto the card
     in the crosswalk's own words, and a reader can argue with it.

THE LEDGER IS NOT A CROSSWALK, deliberately, and for the reason the earlier passes gave:
`data/research/church/second_presbyterian_roll_spend_1835.json` carries no "crosswalk" in its
name so that `measure_research_spend.py` does not read a record of WRITES as a second
adjudication and report the pass grading its own homework.
