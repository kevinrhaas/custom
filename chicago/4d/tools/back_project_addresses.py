"""Position an 1835 business from an address printed after 1835 — T-0633.

THE FOURTH GRAMMAR. `docs/STREET-FACE-ADOPTION.md` (L212), `docs/CORNER-ORDINAL.md`
(L215) and `docs/LOT-ADDRESS.md` (L216) each answer a way a Chicago paper of 1834-5
places a building: a street is a FACE, a count of doors off a corner is a POSITION
ALONG a face, a lot-and-block is the PLAT'S OWN UNIT. All three read a source written
inside the target year. This tool answers a fourth, and the whole of its difficulty is
that the source is written AFTER it: T-0632 wrote 87 addresses onto the people of 1835
out of Fergus's directories of 1839 and 1843 and Norris's of 1844, and an address
printed four, eight or nine years later is not an address in 1835. `docs/ADDRESS-BACK-
PROJECTION.md` is the policy and **L218** is the liberty; this file is the only thing
that writes a back-projected position, and it writes nothing the policy does not allow.

WHAT IT ADJUDICATES. Every `directories.people[].address_later` on
`data/residents/households/*.json` — all of them, so that a refusal is RECORDED rather
than dropped. Each gets exactly one outcome:

  placed                 the four clauses hold; a face, or a corner where the cross
                         street is 1835's too, graded `reconstructed`
  already_better_placed  the household already carries a real `works_at`; clause 2
                         says an 1835 placement always wins, and this pass stands off
  refused                a clause fails, and the clause that failed is named

THE FOUR CLAUSES, and the record says which one decided it:

  1. The 1835 record has to attest a business to position. A person the 1835 corpus
     gives no trade has no business for a later door to place, and minting one out of
     an 1844 directory is the one thing the ticket forbids outright.
  2. Nothing better places it. A real `works_at` wins; so does a residence address,
     which is not this pass's claim at all and is left to T-0669.
  3. The address has to resolve onto the 1835 street grid — the street existed under
     that name, in that place, on the scene date. `data/streets/1835.json` is that
     record and this tool holds to it: `North Dearborn street` is a north-side street
     the 1835 layer does not carry under that name, `Michigan ave` is not `Michigan
     Street`, and a qualifier reading `cor. Monroe` places a shop three blocks south
     of the platted town. Each is refused, by name.
  4. The placement is graded `reconstructed` at best, and its note says in plain words
     that it is a later address read backwards and by how many years.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It deals no roof. `docs/STREET-FACE-ADOPTION.md` limit 3 says the
allocation of a business to one roof on a face "is an allocation, not a reading", and
stacking that allocation on top of an address already read back four to nine years
would produce a building attachment a reader would badly over-read. So the unit here is
the FACE — the same unit the owner's ruling of 2026-08-29 says a street name constrains
— and `lives_at` and `works_at` are not touched by this pass at all.
