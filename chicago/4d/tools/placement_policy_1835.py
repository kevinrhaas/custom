"""Who lived and worked where in July 1835, written once as rules with their evidence.

The owner asked for it in one sentence: *"spread the businesses and residences and all
other civic and other structures across the city correctly along lot lines and corners
and lots … I think you will have multiple buildings per lot in many cases in the major
streets … do what you can to make the location of reconstructed businesses and residents
as reasonable and accurate as a historian would."*

The project already held most of that policy — in six different places, none of them
readable as a rule:

    T-0024  the face rule's non-dwelling clause — a store never on a `light` street
    T-0023  the end rule — the better roof nearer the drawbridge
    T-0022  the frontage-fabric ruling — log trade buildings DO stand on principal streets
    T-0079  the density standard — three party-line units per lot
    T-0213  the trade share by street class
    K1      "businesses toward the river and the built streets, residences further out"

Three of those are modules that each re-typed the same numbers. This one writes the
policy down, gives the numbers ONE home, and hands the seating tickets a file instead of
a memory.

## What is authored here and what is read from the tree

The CLAUSES are authored — they are this project's reading of how an 1835 lake town
arranged itself, and every one of them carries its tier and its evidence. Everything
printed BESIDE a clause is re-read from the committed tree on every run: how many of its
evidence records stand, what class of street each is nearest, and the setbacks they keep.
`--check` rebuilds the file and refuses any drift between the two, which is what makes a
clause a reading of the record rather than a preference about frontage.

## The one-source-of-truth clause, and it is the part with teeth

Five numbers were typed into four modules, under seven names. They now live in `constants` and the modules
import them:

    street_line_m        2.71   STREET_LINE_M         measure_frontage_fabric
    party_line_unit_m    6.072  PARTY_LINE_UNIT_M     measure_end_rule
    trade_letters        C F W  TRADE_LETTERS         measure_frontage_fabric
                                LIGHT_STREET_ZERO     generate_block_infill
    non_dwelling_letters CFTWI  NON_DWELLING          measure_face_rule
                                NON_DWELLING_LETTERS  generate_block_infill
    commercial_letter    C      COMMERCIAL            measure_face_rule

Assertion 5 below reads each module's source and fails if one of them carries its own
copy of a constant again. A single source of truth that nothing checks is a comment.

## The outliers are evidence, and the policy notes them

A documented building standing against its own clause is not a fault in the record; it is
the record telling you something the clause does not say. `--score` finds them by
measurement and this module supplies the reason for each by hand — and assertion 3
refuses an outlier nobody has explained, so a new one cannot appear silently. Eleven
stand today and they fall into three groups: the unplatted military reservation, which
has no street frontage to take a better or worse face of; Wolf Point and the north bank,
where the nearest committed centreline is across the river; and the north division, which
in July 1835 has almost no street control at all.

**No roof moves.** This module reads; it writes one file and never a structure.

    tools/placement_policy_1835.py --score      every documented roof against its clause
