"""A house's live placement against everything its own printings said (T-0440).

WHAT THIS COUNTS, AND WHY IT IS COUNTED RATHER THAN ARGUED.

`compile_gazetteer.py` mints a house's dict from WHICHEVER CLAIM MINTS THE KEY — the
earliest printing the corpus carries — and takes `placement` and `street` from it.
Every later printing's placement is kept as a READING with its own dates (T-0345), but
until T-0440 nothing downstream of the mint ever revised the live one. So a standing
advertisement that ran without an address in its first week and with one afterwards
stood at `{"class": "none"}` for good, `compile_register.resolve_anchor` was handed no
anchor, and the row read `unplaceable` — while three of the house's own printings said
otherwise a few lines below in the same file.

Clark, Filer & Co. is the house it was found on: silent on 1834-05-28, then *"their ware
house on South water St. five [doors east] of the corner [of Randolph st.]"* on
1834-06-11, 1834-06-18 and 1834-07-02, and `unplaceable` in the register throughout.
T-0440 asked for the count of others before it asked for a repair, because a defect one
house shows is a bug and a defect fourteen show is a rule choosing wrongly.

THE TWO POPULATIONS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS THIS PASS'S TO FIX.

  * **SILENT, THEN PLACED** — the live placement places nothing and some printing of the
    same house does. A printing that omits the address does not contradict one that gives
    it; it simply did not repeat it, which is what a standing advertisement does every
    other week. There is no judgement about a house that MOVED to be made here, so
    `compile_gazetteer` takes the earliest placing reading and this report expects the
    count to be ZERO on a compiled tree. `--check` asserts exactly that.

  * **PLACED, THEN PLACED BETTER** — the live placement already puts the house somewhere
    and a later printing puts it somewhere narrower, or somewhere else. Preferring one
    printed address to another is a statement about the house or about the advertisement,
    and the only thing in this project that may make it is the authored `anchor_changes`
    rule, which has to name the anchors verbatim and say what the corpus leaves open.
    **Nothing here repairs these and nothing should**: they are REPORTED, with the class
    they hold and the class they were outranked by, so the queue can see how many are
    waiting on a judgement.

    T-0773 counted that population and found that only part of it is waiting on anything,
    so it is reported in three lines rather than one. A house whose `anchor_changes` rule
    has been WRITTEN has had the judgement made and is not waiting for it — the class rank
    still calls it outranked, because a ruling that a house moved will routinely leave the
    live anchor coarser than a sharper reading of where it used to be, and the rank cannot
    see the ruling. G. Spring is that case: ruled onto Dearborn Street beside the Tremont
    House, and still nominally outranked by a `corner` reading of the Franklin and South
    Water office he left. And a house outranked only by a printing AFTER the scene date is
    the same bound as the line below it working, not a judgement anyone may make: no rule
    could prefer that address without placing the house on the strength of an
    advertisement that had not run yet.

The rank is `compile_gazetteer.placement_rank`, read from that module rather than
retyped, so this report and the compiler cannot disagree about what outranks what.
