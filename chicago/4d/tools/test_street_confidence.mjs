/**
 * T-0100 / T-0713 — a street's grades reach the picture, and each grades the
 * thing it is a claim about.
 *
 * T-0100. `streets.js` used to grade a ribbon by `surface_confidence` and
 * `wear_confidence` alone and never by `geometry_confidence` — the field that
 * says whether the LINE was traced, inferred or invented. A street whose route
 * was invented but whose surface and wear were attested drew at full
 * confidence, and turning `reconstructed` off left the invention standing.
 * T-0100 fixed that by taking the weakest of all three.
 *
 * T-0713 splits the one grade back into the two claims it had flattened:
 *
 *   `_confidence`, the contract's channel and the one the confidence view
 *   reads, carries the LINE's grade alone — presence, dither, and which level
 *   hides the ribbon. That is the claim "a street ran here".
 *
 *   `_trackConfidence`, a second channel read only inside the street material,
 *   carries the weakest of surface and wear and fades the WORN TEXTURE while
 *   the view is on. That is the claim "and it looked like this".
 *
 * The guard T-0100 bought is not weakened by the split and this file is what
 * proves it: an invented line under an attested surface still dithers out, and
 * a record with no geometry grade still reads as invented rather than as
 * attested. What the split adds is the converse — an ATTESTED line under an
 * invented wear no longer dithers away, because "we do not know how worn it
 * was" is not a reason to tell the visitor the street was not there.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST SLICES THE SOURCE INSTEAD OF IMPORTING IT. `addRecord` is not
 * exported and `streets.js` pulls in three, which will not load headless. The
 * alternative — copying the expressions into the test — would let the shipped
 * ones drift away from the tested ones silently, which is the failure mode
 * these tickets are about in the first place. So both expressions are
 * EXTRACTED from `renderers/web/js/streets.js` and evaluated, the same way
 * `tools/measure_rank_bias.mjs` takes its primitives out of `flora.js`. Every
 * extraction is guarded: if the shape moves, this file fails loudly rather
 * than testing a stale copy of itself.
 *
 *   node tools/test_street_confidence.mjs
 *
 * Exit 0 on pass, 1 on any failed check, 2 if the source could not be read the
 * way this test needs to read it (drift).
