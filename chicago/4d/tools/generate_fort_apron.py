"""Generate the bare, trodden ground immediately outside Fort Dearborn's walls (T-0097).

WHAT THIS IS. T-0044's image-accuracy pass read the render against the two committed Fort
Dearborn plates and listed eight gaps. Number 7: *"The ground round the walls is full
prairie sward; both plates show it bare and trodden."* In `p4_0.png` — the fort from the
north bank, the stand this project shoots the fort from — the sward stops well short of the
walls: from the foot of the pickets outward the ground is bare, pale, trodden earth, with a
walking figure on it and the track from the gate crossing it, and the prairie only resumes
past the crest of the bank. In the render, bluestem grew to the foot of the pickets.

**NO SOURCE STATES THIS AND THIS RECORD DOES NOT PRETEND OTHERWISE.** Every value here is
`reconstructed`; `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L174 claims the invention and states its bounds. What
bounds it is (a) the two plates, which are tier-5 pictorial and may drive SETTING as
`inferred` but may never drive a coordinate, and (b) the plain fact that ground worked daily
by a garrison — drill, fatigue parties, wood and water details, the gate traffic — does not
carry 1.5 m of prairie grass.

THE RULE, and it is a rule rather than a hand-drawn polygon precisely so it can be argued
with and re-derived:

  **The band `APRON_M` metres wide immediately outside the palisade's committed footprint,
  on all four sides, is bare trodden earth.**

Not one coordinate here is authored. The band is derived from
`data/sidecars/1835/fort_dearborn_palisade.json` — its `footprint.polygon` and its
`placement` — in the frame `docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md` fixes, so if the fort is ever re-placed or
re-sized the ground follows it. `tools/check.sh` re-derives this file byte for byte.

WHY A FRAME OF FOUR BANDS AND NOT ONE SQUARE. The claim this record makes is about the
ground OUTSIDE the walls. A single square would also lay a treatment over the parade inside
them, which is a second claim, about ground no committed plate shows, and it is not made
here. So the apron is the frame: four bands that tile the annulus exactly, with no overlap
and no gap, and the fort's own interior left as it is.

WHY `trodden_earth` AND NOT `worn_earth`. The two treatments the yard layer already builds
differ in exactly the thing the plate settles: `worn_earth` is a wheeled yard, with ruts and
a wide surviving fringe of trampled grass at its edges; `trodden_earth` is a pen — finer,
darker, no ruts, and trodden right up to its own boundary. `p4_0` draws the second: the bare
ground reaches the pickets with no grassy collar at the wall. The fringe is measured from
the apron's OUTER ring alone (`fringe_ring_local_enu_m`), so the sward feathers in at the
prairie edge and the ground stays bare at the wall — which is what the picture shows and
what a band-by-band fringe would have got wrong at three edges out of four.

WHAT THIS RECORD DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:

  * It draws no fence. The enclosure here is the palisade, which is a committed structure
    with a baked GLB; this record carries the ground and nothing else, which is why its
    `runs` are empty and why it says so in as many words.
  * It does not clip the fort road. The road (T-0044) arrives at the south gate and its
    last ~7 m of track lies on the apron. Both are bare-earth drapes at the same lift, both
    are `reconstructed`, and a travelled track crossing a trodden apron is what the plate
    draws; clipping one out of the other would be inventing a boundary the picture has not
    got.
  * It does not reach the water. `renderers/web/js/yards.js` drops any cell whose foot is
    in the river mask, so the north band stops itself at the bank rather than being trimmed
    by a number authored here.
  * It does not touch the bank's shape. Nothing here regrades a metre of terrain; the
    treatment is draped on the committed heightfield.

WHAT WOULD MOVE IT OFF RECONSTRUCTION: a garrison return or quartermaster's account
describing the ground of the reservation; an 1830s survey of the United States Reservation
showing cleared ground; or an identification of either plate against a dated original that
would raise it above tier 5.
