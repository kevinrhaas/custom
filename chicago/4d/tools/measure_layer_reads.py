"""Which of a plant's, an animal's or a resident's figures reaches a vertex.

ROADMAP K42, opened by K41. This project answers that question for two of its
layers and had never asked it of the other two.

    generators/archetypes/*_params.py   declares CONSUMED — the form attributes
                                        the building generator reads
    generators/terrain_inputs.py        declares CONSUMED — the terrain spec
                                        figures the ground generator reads

`tools/validate.py` turns each of those into a rule: every figure OUTSIDE the
read-set carries a declaration saying what the mesh does instead, because the
confidence model grades how sure we are of a value and says nothing at all about
whether the thing was built. A `documented` painted wolf sign over a building
with no sign on it is the failure that rule exists to end.

`data/flora/` and `data/fauna/` have no such map, and they are not small: 154
plant records across ten communities, 139 animal records across ten habitat
zones, 202 and 30 citations of a source whose rights are unresolved (K41). Every
figure in them is shipped to a browser, and until this ran nothing here could say
which ones a visitor is looking at.

AND NEITHER DID `data/residents/`, which is ROADMAP K52 and ticket T-0021. That
layer is 201 households and 237 person entries, and its box says plainly why it
was the harder of the two rather than the easier: it already had *a* reader —
`tools/compile_scene.py` attaches a household to a building's sidecar and
`popup.js` names it on the card — and **"a layer with one reader is exactly where
an unread figure hides, because 'the browser has it' reads as 'somebody looks at
it'."** K52 then gave it a second reader, the Evidence panel's people section,
and the layer STILL was not censused: assertion 3a below can only fail for a
layer this file knows about, and its layer list was two names long, so a
directory a renderer opens and a map nobody wrote went to no assertion at all.
That is the same expired-claim shape 3a exists to catch, one level up — the gate
was blind rather than wrong.

Censusing it found the thing a census is for. Three of a person's figures —
`age_on_scene_date`, `birth_year` and `name_basis` — are graded claim blocks and
were being handed whole to a text renderer, so **113 person rows read "How this
person is named — [object Object]"**, hiding the sentence this project most needs
read: *"THE NAME IS INVENTED. No source names this resident."* A figure that
arrives on the card as `[object Object]` has not reached a visitor. They are
`shown` here because they are shown now; the commit that declared them is the
commit that fixed them, which is the only order that is honest.

WHY THE MAP IS IN PYTHON AND THE READER IS JAVASCRIPT. `terrain_inputs.py` gives
the argument for not co-locating a read-set with the code that reads: there the
generator's bytes are hashed into the ground, so a constant no builder reads
would have demanded a Blender bake. Here the reason is plainer — the reader is
`renderers/web/js/`, the gate is a Python script, and a declaration written into
the renderer would be a renderer change with a 26-minute smoke behind it every
time a key moved. What co-location would have bought is bought the same way the
terrain buys it: **every declaration is scanned against the renderer sources**,
in both directions, with the JS comments stripped first. A `read` declaration
names an expression that must still be in the source; an `unread` figure must not
be accessible anywhere in it. So a declaration that stops being true fails here
rather than quietly excusing an omission.

    tools/measure_layer_reads.py              print the census
    tools/measure_layer_reads.py --gate       exit 1 on a divergence
    tools/measure_layer_reads.py --self-test  break each assertion, in memory
    tools/measure_layer_reads.py --update     rewrite the baseline

THE FOUR STATES. Three of them are reads and the fourth is the finding.

    mesh    a vertex or a pixel comes from the value
    shown   the renderer reads it and shows it to a visitor as text
    probe   the renderer reads it into a diagnostic or a gate accessor, and
            nothing a visitor sees comes from it
    unread  nothing in the renderer reads it at all

`machinery` is the fifth thing and is not a state: identity, file routing and
provenance keys — `id`, `file`, `sources`, `note` — are not figures and never
reach the gate, exactly as `compile_scene.ground_fields` strips them on the
ground side. An explicit read declaration outranks the machinery list, which is
how `species[].confidence` — a provenance grade everywhere else in this project,
and a colour here, because the confidence view tints each plant by it — is
counted as a figure that reaches a pixel.

FIVE ASSERTIONS.

1.  **(absolute) Every figure present in the data is classified.** A new key in a
    zone, a manifest or a palette with no entry here fails. "The renderer ignores
    it" and "nobody has said" are different states and only one of them is a
    finding — the terrain gate's sentence, arriving on the vegetation.

2.  **(absolute) Every read declaration is a real read.** The expression it names
    must appear in the renderer sources with comments stripped. Stripping first
    is not fastidiousness: `flora.js` discusses `bare_soil_fraction: 0.45` in a
    comment three lines above the line that reads it, and a scan that matches its
    own explanatory prose proves nothing (`check_sidecar_contract` reported
    itself on its first run for exactly this).

3.  **(absolute) Every unread figure is really unread**, in two halves. The
    strong half is the LAYER: a layer no renderer source opens has been read by
    nothing in it, and a layer that gains a reader fails here, because the whole
    of its unread bank rests on nobody opening it. **That is what happened.** It
    settled `data/fauna` entirely until 2026-08-17, when ROADMAP K51 gave the
    layer a reader — `renderers/web/js/fauna.js`, the Evidence panel's wildlife
    section — and this assertion did exactly what it was built for: the thirty
    figures behind that sentence had to be classified in the same commit instead
    of resting on a claim that had quietly expired. All thirty are `shown` and
    none is `mesh`; no animal is drawn in this scene. The narrow half is per
    figure: the reverse scan looks for a
    property access of the leaf. Leaves whose bare name collides with the
    renderer's own vocabulary — `rgb` is a three.js shader field as well as a
    palette key — are declared in `AMBIGUOUS_LEAVES` and scanned
    parent-qualified. Leaves whose name is read under ANOTHER record kind —
    `bare_soil_fraction` is read off a zone and copied into the manifest — are
    listed as shared and exempted, because a text scan cannot attribute a
    property access to one of two records that both have that field, and a scan
    that cannot fail honestly is worse than a stated exemption.

4.  **The unread population is banked and may not grow.** `tools/layer_reads_
    baseline.json`, keyed by layer, record kind and field path, with the number
    of records carrying each figure. A new unread figure fails: either the
    renderer reads it, or shipping it to a browser is a decision somebody makes
    on purpose in the commit that adds it.

5.  **(absolute) The bank may not outlive the data.** An entry that is no longer
    in the tree fails until it is un-banked with `--update` in the same commit,
    because a repair here is a claim and recording it is part of making it.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DECIDE. Whether an unread figure should be deleted, wired up
or declared is three different answers for three different findings, and none of
them is this parcel's to make — except where somebody has made it, which is what
`REFUSALS` below is: a figure whose answer is "this should not reach a visitor,
and here is why", written against the figure and carried into the bank: `data/fauna/` is a research dataset whose value
does not depend on a renderer existing, the palette's wind and LOD blocks are
render tuning that the renderer has since re-tuned in its own constants, and
`plantable_in_scene` is gated by `tools/validate.py` on every run. The routes are
written up in `docs/ROADMAP.md` K42. This measures, holds and prints.
