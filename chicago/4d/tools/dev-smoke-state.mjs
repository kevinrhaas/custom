/**
 * T-0216 — dev's STANDING smoke record, so a branch never re-derives dev's reds.
 *
 *   node tools/dev-smoke-state.mjs                 # ask: what does the record say?
 *   node tools/dev-smoke-state.mjs ask --viewport desktop --stage 3
 *   node tools/dev-smoke-state.mjs record run.log  # fold a local smoke log in
 *   node tools/dev-smoke-state.mjs ci 32689397335  # fold a chicago-4d-smoke.yml run in
 *   node tools/dev-smoke-state.mjs ci              # list that workflow's runs on dev
 *   node tools/dev-smoke-state.mjs hash            # the smoke-relevant tree hash
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `chicago-4d-check.yml` runs `check.sh` and nothing else, and
 * `chicago-4d-smoke.yml` is dispatch-plus-one-path, so the smoke state of `dev`
 * has been whatever the last agent happened to run in a worktree. The question
 * every branch asks — *"is this red mine, or did I inherit it?"* — was therefore
 * answered by cutting a clean `origin/dev` worktree and paying for the stage
 * again. On 2026-08-27 THREE separate agents each paid that price on the same
 * red, and the red was neither branch's nor dev's: it was the machine (T-0215).
 * A fourth was re-deriving the desktop triangle-ceiling red the same way.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS A COMMITTED RECORD, NOT A NEW GATE. `.github/workflows/` is
 * outside a steward run's scope (AGENTS.md § How work ships), which is why
 * T-0215 could not build this in its own PR — so the record is fed by the two
 * routes a run already has: the log of a smoke it ran anyway, and the log of a
 * `chicago-4d-smoke.yml` run that already happened. Both go through ONE parser.
 * If the owner later schedules that workflow on `dev`, `ci <id>` is what folds
 * its result in, and nothing here has to change.
 *
 * THE TRAP THE TICKET NAMES, AND HOW EVERY READING ANSWERS IT. *"A result taken
 * on a quiet CI runner does not predict a steward run on a box carrying a dozen
 * agents"* — T-0215's readings differ by a factor of twenty on the same tree. So
 * a reading here is never just pass/fail: it carries the host it was taken on,
 * the CPU count, the load average, its wall clock, and any animation-frame cost
 * the smoke reported. A CI pass does not license ignoring a steward-runner red;
 * it dates it.
 *
 * AND WHAT MAKES A READING *YOURS*. Every reading records `treeHash`, a digest
 * of everything the smoke actually exercises — `renderers/`, `data/`, `assets/`,
 * `tools/smoke_renderer.mjs` and the published mirror `site/chicago/4d/`. If
 * your tree hashes the same as a reading, that reading is a reading OF YOUR
 * TREE: a red in it is inherited, full stop, with no re-run needed. If it does
 * not, the record says so instead of pretending. That is the whole of the
 * ticket's acceptance — answer it from the record, WITHOUT running anything.
 *
 * A RECORD, NEVER A BAR. Nothing here can fail a gate, refuse a merge or excuse
 * a red. It is evidence with its conditions attached, in the shape T-0016's road
 * bands are kept in, and it is read by a human or an agent deciding where to
 * spend the next ten minutes.

  + 'reading OF YOUR TREE. A RECORD, NOT A BAR: nothing here gates anything. THE PART '

  // dev's before a line of real work was written — and a hash that never matches
  // answers "is this red mine?" with "cannot tell", every time. They are
  // excluded for three DIFFERENT reasons and the difference is the point:
  //
  //  - NOT AN INPUT AT ALL. `ticket.mjs claim` mirrors tickets.json into the
  //    published tree in the first commit of every run (T-0154). Neither
  //    smoke_renderer.mjs nor renderers/web reads it — the walkthrough has no
  //    ticket surface — so dropping it loses nothing.
  //  - AN INPUT, HASHED APART. AGENTS.md requires a changelog entry in every PR,
  //    and the release notes ARE read by the smoke — by PART 8 alone (the
  //    What's-new panel: the unread dot, the entry count, the is-new flagging).
  //    So they get their own hash and are reported against part 8.
  //  - A PUBLISH STAMP, NORMALISED AWAY. `publish.sh` stamps a fresh build id
  //    and clock into build.json and into the gate's build line every time it
  //    runs, which is once per PR minimum. build.json is stamp and nothing else;
  //    the gate page is real smoke input carrying a stamp, so it is hashed with
  //    the stamp normalised out rather than dropped.
