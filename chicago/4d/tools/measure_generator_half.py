"""What a generator half for a renderer-drawn layer would cost, measured.

    tools/measure_generator_half.py            print the three readings
    tools/measure_generator_half.py --gate     exit 1 if a stated figure has moved

WHY THIS EXISTS. Ticket T-0059 asked for *"a river-wharf mode of `pier_crib`"*, so
that a town assembled from GLBs alone would carry its docks. `docs/ROADMAP.md` K5
makes the same request of three other clauses in almost the same words — *"the
generator half, so a baked town carries its own yards"*. Before building one, three
things wanted a number rather than an opinion:

  1. **How many committed meshes does adding it re-stale?** `generators/
     mesh_inputs.py` hashes an archetype's builder, `generators/build.py` and
     the geometry-making half of `generators/common/` into every structure asset's
     `inputs_sha256`, and `generators/terrain_inputs.py` hashes `terrain_gen.py`
     and the same modules into every terrain asset's. Which half that is, is
     declared in `generators/code_inputs.py` (T-0164) rather than globbed. `tools/validate.py --stale` fails on
     any asset whose recomputed hash has moved. So the cost of adding a mode is not
     the mode: it is the rebake of everything the edited file's bytes reach. This
     measures that reach per candidate edit site.

  2. **Is a wharf the only layer that owes one?** The wharf is one of the data
     layers drawn at load out of committed JSON rather than loaded as a GLB. If the
     debt is general, paying it one layer at a time — by a route that re-stales the
     town each time — is the wrong shape of work, and the ticket is a fragment of a
     decision nobody has made rather than a unit anybody can ship.

  3. **Who would read the GLBs the mode would produce?** The ticket's motivation is
     *"a scene assembled from GLBs alone has no docks in it"*. That sentence has a
     consumer in it, and whether the consumer exists is checkable: it is the count
     of renderers under `renderers/`. A cost paid for a reader that does not exist
     is a different decision from one paid for a reader that does.

All three are printed. `--gate` holds them against the figures written into this
file's own `STATED` block, which is what makes them a measurement rather than a
number somebody remembers: the two are meant to be edited together, and a reading
that moves without the sentence beside it moving is the drift.

The drawn-layer denominator is derived from the tree — every `data/*/index.json` —
AND held against a named list. Deriving alone would silently absorb the next layer
somebody adds; naming alone would silently miss it. Held against each other, a new
layer fails this gate and gets read by a person, which is the only outcome worth
having.

NO BLENDER, NO NETWORK. It reads `assets/manifest.json`, the generator modules' own
hashing recipes and the committed layer manifests, all of which are in the tree —
the same standing this tool's neighbours in `tools/measure_*.py` have.

# The reading this file was written against, re-taken on 2026-08-27 on `dev`
# @ a638614c (T-0059). `--gate` holds the live measurement to it. Moving a figure
# here is a claim that the reach changed, and it belongs in the same commit as
# whatever changed it.
#
# The two zero rows are T-0164's, added 2026-08-28. `common/phases.py` decides
# whether a mesh is built at all and builds none, and while it was globbed into
# both recipes one comment line in it re-staled 349 of 349. It is out of the hash
# now, `generators/code_inputs.py` says why, and a zero here is what keeps it out:
# put it back and this row reads 349.
#
# 349 -> 350 and 347 -> 348 on 2026-08-28: T-0254 added one structure to the town,
# north_water_slough_crossing. One more committed asset, one more mesh that a change to
# the shared generator modules or to build.py would re-stale; the terrain and pier_crib
# reaches are untouched because the crossing is neither.
#
# 350 -> 353 and 348 -> 351 on 2026-08-28 (T-0028): `blk_lake_franklin` was opened and
# carries three roofs. This is the ordinary movement of the reading, not a change in
# reach — a structure asset is in `build.py`'s reach by construction — and the terrain
# and pier_crib reaches stay at 2 each, which is the point of stating them separately.
#
# 353 -> 354 and 351 -> 352 on 2026-08-28 (T-0096): `fort_dearborn_flagstaff__staff_1833_37.glb`,
# the garrison flagstaff Andreas attests. One new fort_structure record, so one more committed
# asset and one more mesh a change to the shared generator modules or to build.py would re-stale.
#
# 354 -> 358 and 352 -> 356 on 2026-08-29 (T-0317): `blk_randolph_market` took its second
# deal — a party-line run of three on the block's free corner lot and the stable in its yard.
# Four new structure assets, so four more meshes a change to the shared generator modules or
# to build.py would re-stale; the terrain and pier_crib reaches stay at 2 each.
#
# 358 -> 359 and 356 -> 357 on 2026-08-29 (T-0380): `new_york_house__frame_1834.glb`, the
# frame hotel on Lake Street near Wells this project had wrongly excluded. One new
# frame_tavern record, so one more committed asset and one more mesh a change to the shared
# generator modules or to build.py would re-stale; terrain and pier_crib stay at 2 each.
#
# 359 -> 360 and 357 -> 358 on 2026-08-30 (T-0384): `john_holbrook_store__frame_1835.glb`,
# the clothing store two papers place one door from Dearborn on South Water Street. One new
# frame_storefront record, so one more committed asset and one more mesh a change to the
# shared generator modules or to build.py would re-stale; terrain and pier_crib stay at 2.
#
# 359 -> 367 and 357 -> 365 on 2026-08-30 (T-0429): `blk_south_water_lasalle` took its second
# deal — a party-line run of six along the west half of the block's South Water frontage and the
# two yard buildings on the lots it stands on. Eight new structure assets, so eight more meshes a
# change to the shared generator modules or to build.py would re-stale; the terrain and pier_crib
# reaches stay at 2 each.
#
# 368 -> 372 and 366 -> 370 on 2026-09-03 (T-0430): `blk_south_water_franklin` took its
# second deal — a party-line run of three on the block's one free lot of South Water
# frontage and the privy in the yard behind them. Four new structure assets, so four more
# meshes a change to the shared generator modules or to build.py would re-stale; the
# terrain and pier_crib reaches stay at 2 each.
#
# 372 -> 374 and 370 -> 372 on 2026-09-05 (T-0431): `blk_south_water_clark` took its second
# deal — one C2 store-residence on the block's one free lot of South Water frontage, party-
# walled to Pruyne & Kimball's drug store, and the privy in the yard behind it. Two new
# structure assets, so two more meshes a change to the shared generator modules or to
