"""The street edge's face enumeration, driven over the cross streets it does not
yet carry.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `tools/generate_frontage_works.py` lays the town's plank walks
on the block faces that front a covered street, and until T-0192 it enumerated
two faces of four: an east-west street bounds a block on its NORTH or SOUTH
face, a cross street on its EAST or WEST, and only the first pair was ever
looked at. Naming Clark Street in the covered tuple would therefore have laid
nothing at all — silently, with no refusal on the record — whatever the frame
budget said.

T-0192 enumerated all four and made every ordering in that generator axis-aware:
a face's position along Lake Street is its easting and along Clark Street its
northing, and the corner crossings, the across-the-road pairing and the face
sort all read the street's own axis now. **And then the seven cross streets were
measured and left out**: all three scene-detail tiers go over their ceilings with
them in, by 145,639 / 122,299 / 15,372 triangles at T-0135's worst stand, on a
`dev` that stands half of one per cent inside two of those ceilings before a
board is laid. The numbers are on the record, in that generator's own `refused`.

So `EDGE_CROSS_STREETS` is empty and the whole east/west path would be DEAD CODE
— written, measured once, and then never executed by any gate, free to rot until
the day the budget is won back and somebody trusts it. This test is what keeps it
alive: it drives the generator's own rule over all seven cross streets on every
commit and asserts the answers the plat gives, in about a hundredth of a second
and without building a single board.
