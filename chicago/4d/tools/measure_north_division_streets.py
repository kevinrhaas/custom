"""The North Division's north-south streets, read off the Thompson plat (T-0451).

T-0451 measured `data/streets/1835.json` and found ONE north-south street standing
north of the main stem — `wolcott` — where the plat carries the North Division's whole
grid. Seven numbered blocks cannot be bounded east and west by one line, so the tiers
between Kinzie Street and North Water Street had no cross streets and a walker saw
unbroken ground where the sheet shows blocks.

This is the reading that closes it, and its shape is T-0445's: seat what the sheet and
the modelled ground can carry, and state in numbers what they cannot.

WHAT THE SHEET SAYS, and the negative half is the important half:

* The North Division carries ONE tier of blocks between Kinzie Street and North Water
  Street, numbered 1 at the east end against the Due North line and 7 at the west end
  against the North Branch. Six 80-ft corridors stand between them.
* The sheet NAMES its north-south streets — MARKET, FRANKLIN, WELLS, LA SALLE, CLARKE
  (with an E) and DEARBORN, lettered once each in the Randolph-Washington tier — and it
  names NONE of them north of the river. Every North Division corridor carries the
  figure 80 at its head and a vertical ST. and nothing else.
* But it draws them as ONE LINE. Read as pixels on the sheet, the North Division's
  corridor centres stand within 1.5 px — 0.8 m through the fit — of the South Division
  corridors of the same street on four of the six, and the whole tier's block pitch is
  the South Division's own to 0.6 m in the mean.

So the six lines are seated as the committed South Division streets continued north from
North Water Street to Kinzie Street, and the NAME each carries is the sheet's own name on
the same line SOUTH of the river. That is a carry, not a North Division reading, and the
record says so: `wolcott` is this project's standing proof that a North Division name
could differ from the South Division name on the same line.

WHAT IS NOT SEATED THE SAME WAY. Five of the six lines agree with the plat's own module
to 2.4 m and are graded `attested`, on the owner's T-0713 ruling that a street the plat
draws is attested. `market_north` does not: the plat's corridor stands 9.2 m west of the
committed `market` line extended, four times the worst of the other five, and the
committed `market->franklin` pitch (118.5 m) is the one South Division pitch that is
already off the plat's 400 ft module. The anomaly is in the committed line — it is fitted
to modern N Wacker Drive, which was built on made ground after the river was walled — not
in the North Division, and `market_north` is graded `inferred` until that is settled.
