"""What lies in the gap the re-centred South Water corridor opens, measured on the ground.

T-0419, and it is a MEASUREMENT with a question at the end of it — not a repair. The
owner ruled on 2026-08-29 (T-0009) that a platted corridor is derived from the street
CONTROL rather than from the drawn centreline. On `south_water` that translates the
corridor +8.58 m in northing. Its block faces do not move: `generate_plat_lots.block_edges`
offsets the DRAWN line by the same half-module, so the corridor and the blocks stop
abutting and a band of ground belongs to neither.

**The ticket forbids fixing it here, and this tool does not.** It moves nothing, writes
nothing into `data/`, and is not wired to any generator. It answers the three questions
the ticket's acceptance asks — how big the band is, how many lots and committed roofs it
holds, and how much of it is dry — and prices the fork so the owner can rule on it.

**There are TWO bands, not one.** The ticket names the southern one; the displacement
makes a second of the same size on the other side, and leaving it out would have priced
half the question:

* `abandoned` — inside the DRAWN corridor, outside the control one. It lies between the
  block's north face and the corridor's new south edge, and belongs to neither.
* `claimed` — inside the CONTROL corridor, outside the drawn one. The corridor takes it,
  and on this street what is on that side is the river.

**How the bands are measured.** A vertical scanline at `AREA_PITCH_M`, differenced in one
dimension against both rings. That is a Riemann sum over exact ring crossings rather than
a raster of point tests, so the areas are the polygons' own to the pitch, and it stays
honest where South Water bends onto the dry bank and a vertical cut through its corridor
is half as long again as the corridor is wide. Ground is sampled separately, on a square
grid, because dryness is a property of a place and not of a column.

**Dry means the same zero the rest of this project uses** — `measure_no_build_ground`'s
`WATER_SURFACE_M`, sampled from the committed 1834 heightfield, one millimetre above the
water rather than a freeboard. `--counterfactual` re-derives the whole plat grid with the
control-centred line standing in as the block grid's own control, which is the cost of the
branch that moves the lots.
