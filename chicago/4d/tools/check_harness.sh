# The gate's step harness — sourced by tools/check.sh.
#
# It is a file of its own for one reason: tools/test_check_harness.sh can source it
# and exercise it, which nothing could do while it lived inline in a 2,500-line gate.
#
# T-0763. A SELF-TEST IS NOT A FAILURE, AND THE OUTPUT USED TO SAY OTHERWISE.
# Around a hundred steps here deliberately break a derivation and REQUIRE its
# assertions to fire. A fired assertion prints the same `FAIL <sentence>` a real one
# does — one of them prints `2 check(s) FAILED` — so on a GREEN tree (`check.sh` exit
# 0) the output carried fourteen lines that read exactly like a broken gate. That cost
# three tickets: T-0745 wrote three of its four acceptance clauses on six such lines
# and sent the next run at terrain and street geometry that were fine, and T-0522,
# T-0612 and T-0683 each reported a red dev that was not one.
#
# Two changes, and neither silences anything:
#
#   1. `selftest` replaces `step` for those steps. It marks the heading and prefixes
#      EVERY line of the transcript with CHECK_SELFTEST_TAG, so a fired assertion is
#      legible as one at the line level — which is the level `grep -i fail` reads at,
#      and the level a run's log gets skimmed at.
#   2. `check_summary` names the failing steps ONCE at the end. The roll-up existed
#      only inline, next to the step that failed, a thousand lines up.
#
# tools/test_check_harness.sh holds both to that, and scans check.sh for a self-test
# that went back through `step`.

# Every line of a self-test's transcript starts with this. Deliberately plain ASCII
# and no colour: its whole job is to survive a grep and a log file.

# T-1289. WHERE THE GATE'S TIME GOES, recorded rather than guessed. Set
# CHECK_TIMINGS to a path and every step appends "<seconds>\t<kind>\t<label>" to it.
# Off by default: no file, no cost beyond two clock reads a step. The gate's duration
# is the window in which `dev` can move under an open pull request, so it is the
# number that decides how much a merge round costs — and nothing here measured it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# T-1289. THE GATE RUNS ITS STEPS IN PARALLEL, AND PRINTS THEM IN ORDER.
#
# WHY THIS IS THE FIX AND NOT A MERGE-ORDERING ONE. Every merge into `dev` makes
# every other open pull request `dirty`, and the window in which that can happen to
# a PR is exactly how long its gate takes. T-1289 proposed three ways to reorder
# MERGES; none of them shortens the gate, and on 2026-09-18 three pull requests cost
# nine dev merges between them, four of those on one PR that was overtaken three
# times while its gate ran. Shortening the window attacks the cause.
#
# MEASURED, because the ticket says an unmeasured change here is not this ticket.
# 499 steps, 773 s serial. 380 of them (76 %) finish in under a second and together
# account for under a tenth of the time; the slowest twenty are half of it, and one
# self-test alone is 79 s. That shape decided the design:
#
#     4 jobs, ordered batches (each batch costs its slowest member):  559 s, 1.4x
#     4 jobs, work-stealing  (a free worker takes the next step):     240 s, 3.2x
#
# Batching was the simpler code and it is worth 1.4x, because the heavy tail lands
# one long step in a batch and the other three wait on it. So this is a real pool.
#
# ORDER IS PRESERVED IN THE OUTPUT, WHICH IS THE PART THAT MATTERS. The transcript
# is read by people and by agents, and T-0763 is the record of what happens when it
# reads wrong — three tickets filed against self-test lines that were never failures.
# So a step's output is captured whole and replayed at its declared position, never
# interleaved. A parallel run's log is byte-comparable with a serial one.
#
# CHECK_JOBS=1 keeps the old path exactly: run, print, move on. Nothing is queued and
# no temporary file is made. That is the escape hatch for any step that turns out to
# share state with another, and the control in the before/after measurement.
