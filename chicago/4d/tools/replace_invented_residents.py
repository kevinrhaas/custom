WHAT THIS IS FOR.

The town holds 113 households raised because the trade census demanded them and
no documented person was available to fill them. Every one carries an invented
name and a `name_basis` block saying so. `data/research/newspapers/
register_1835.json` now names, per trade, the documented people the papers put in
Chicago — `action: replace_invented` is exactly the register's finding that a
trade the town INVENTED a household for has a documented practitioner. This is
the pass that spends that finding: the documented man takes the roof, the
invented name is retired, and the card shows a real person with a newspaper
citation where it showed an invention.

WHAT THE ROOF KEEPS, AND WHY THE GRADE IS `inferred` AND NOT `attested`.

The PERSON becomes documented; the HOUSEHOLD does not. Nothing says where any of
these men slept, and the dwelling under them is still the reconstruction's — its
existence, its position and its footprint are unchanged and still conjectural.
`inferred` is this vocabulary's word for exactly that: a real person carrying
reconstructed details, with a note saying which details and from what. Grading
them `attested` would claim the dwelling as well as the man, which is the one
thing this pass must not do. docs/LIBERTIES.md L205 owns the placement.

THE DEAL, AND THE REFUSALS THAT SHAPE IT.

The register's candidate list is a compilation and not a nomination: it ranks by
trade and it does not ask whether a name is a man, whether he is already in this
town, or whether he was anywhere near it. Dealing it unguarded would have put a
partnership on a roof as a household head, minted a second John T. Temple, and
moved Bernardus Laughton off the Aux Plaines into the North Division. So a
candidate is REFUSED, and the refusal printed with its reason, when:

  1. `garbled`            — the transcription bracketed the name as uncertain.
                            'A CLY BOUR:' is not somebody's name.
  2. `a firm, not a person` — 'Pierce & Abbott', 'Matthias Mason & Co.',
                            'Johnson & Stevens'. A firm cannot head a household;
                            it is a BUSINESS, and the businesses are T-0263's.
  3. `first evidence after the scene date` — AGENTS.md rule 3. A man first
                            printed on 1835-08-15 is not put in the town of
                            1 July 1835 on the strength of it.
  4. `placed somewhere in particular` — the gazetteer gives him a named house or
                            a place outside the town: the Man Trap, a farm two
                            miles out, the Aux Plaines. A documented address is
                            EVIDENCE ABOUT WHERE HE WAS, and moving him onto
                            whichever reconstructed roof this deal happened to
                            reach would contradict his own record. Nothing here
                            can honour such a place, so the refusal stands.

                            T-0367 NARROWED THIS TO WHAT IT IS ACTUALLY ABOUT. It
                            used to refuse a documented STREET too, which is a
                            place this scene holds: `tools/fronting_street.py`
                            derives, from the platted lot a roof stands on, which
                            street it fronts, so the deal can now ask. A man whose
                            own record names a committed street is no longer
                            refused for being placed — he may take a roof of his
                            trade THAT STANDS ON THAT STREET, and only such a
                            roof. Where none does, refusal 8 says which street was
                            wanted and what the trade's roofs front instead.

  8. `wanted <street>, and no roof of his trade fronts it` — the street is
                            committed and the man is placeable; the town simply
                            has no invented roof of his trade on it. Six candidates
                            sit here on the tree this was written against, out of
                            the 27 the flat refusal used to hold, and the reason is
                            worth reading: every reconstructed roof
                            fronting South Water Street that carries a HOUSEHOLD is
                            a LABOURER's, so a baker, two joiners and two
                            shoemakers the papers put on South Water have no
                            dwelling on it to take. That is a fact about where the
                            occupation census placed the trades, not about the
                            evidence, and it is the finding this refusal exists to
                            surface.

                            T-0375 ASKED WHETHER THE TRADE A ROOF CARRIES COULD BE
                            RE-ARGUED AGAINST THE STREET IT FRONTS, and the answer
                            is no — but not for the reason the sentence above used
                            to imply, which is why it now says `dwelling` and
                            `carries a household` rather than `nowhere to go`.
                            `docs/STREET-FACE-ADOPTION.md`, the owner's ruling of
                            2026-08-29, already stands four of those six men on
                            South Water Street as documented STOREFRONTS —
                            D. Graves, A. Filer & Co., L. W. Montgomery and John
                            Holbrook — and that pass has taken all fourteen roofs
                            on the face it was allowed to take, leaving three more
                            businesses refused for want of one. So reseating a
                            shoemaker household onto a South Water roof of its own
                            family band would not add a man to the street; it
                            would evict a better-evidenced documented business
                            from a roof one-for-one, and it would stand
                            L. W. Montgomery or John Holbrook on that street a
                            second time. The remaining route — trading a
                            labourer's D1 log cabin for a shoemaker's D4 cottage
                            — is a claim about those men's means that no source
                            carries, and the family band IS that claim. The
                            refusal therefore stands and now names the adoption
                            when there is one, so it can never again be read as
                            saying the man is absent from the town.
  5. `already named in the town` — his surname already appears, capitalised, in a
                            committed structure record, household record or the
                            exclusions. The dataset has something to say about
                            that name already, and a pass that plants him on a
                            reconstructed roof would be answering a question that
                            is already open somewhere else. Deliberately blunt and
                            deliberately over-cautious: a wrongly refused
                            candidate costs a roof, a wrongly accepted one mints
                            a second copy of a real man.
  6. `spoken for by a placeable business` — the register carries a BUSINESS under
                            the same surname that it can put somewhere: an
                            `enrich_existing`, a `new_building` or a `street_only`
                            action. Those are the storefront tickets' to place,
                            and a man cannot be given a reconstructed dwelling in
                            one division while the same pass of work is standing
                            his shop in another. A business the register calls
                            `unplaceable` spoken for nobody and does not refuse.
                            T-0367: a dwelling on the SAME street as the shop is
                            not a fight, so where his own record and his shop both
                            name a street, that street is the only one he may take
                            a roof on. The comparison is made against the streets
                            the business record itself carries — `street_id`, a
                            corner's two sides, or the derived frontage of the
                            committed structure it is anchored to.
  7. `surname already dealt` — one surname, one roof. A shared surname reads as
                            kinship and this pass claims none; it is also how the
                            same man under two printed forms ('D. Graves' and
                            'Graves, D.') would otherwise take two roofs.

Candidates that survive are ranked by evidence — mentions first, then earliest
appearance, then id — and paired with that trade's invented roofs in id order.
Everything is deterministic: no randomness, no date, no hand-picked list.

WHAT THIS FILE WILL NOT DO. It will not upgrade a confidence to fill a roof, it
will not cite a claim the gazetteer does not carry, and it will not deal a
candidate past a refusal. A trade whose candidates are all refused keeps its
invented household, and `--report` says which refusal took each one.
