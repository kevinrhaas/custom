"""What the research domains have READ, against what the town has SPENT.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-03 the owner reported, of the 1840 census reading
tickets: "i see lots of research being done and some apparent findings from
parsing but there are not outputs or updates to the household and resident data
it seems, should i be concerned?"

He was right, and nothing in the repo could have told him so. Every reading
ticket DOES leave an output — T-0584 wrote 2,354 lines of page records, a
coverage entry and a changelog line — so no gate was red and no run was idle.
The hole was one layer down: `data/research/census_1840/` held 562 named heads
read off the sheets and `census_1840/crosswalk.json` held `passes: []`,
`merges: []`, `refusals: []`. Nothing had crossed into the town. Four of 828
household records carried an 1840 link.

`coverage.json` already answers "which images have been looked at, and what has
NOT been read from them" — deliberately, so a hole fails rather than passes
quietly. This is the same instrument one step later: which names have been READ,
and how many of them anybody has RULED ON. A domain may read far ahead of its
spending — the ratified ladder REQUIRES it, since 1839/1840 alone is never an
1835 resident and the bridge is a separate adjudicated step — but the gap may
not silently WIDEN. That is what this gate holds.

THE MEASURE, and what each half deliberately does not count.

  read    a unit captured off a source and carrying a name or a quote: an entry
          of a `records` array (domains that hold records) or of a `claims`
          array (domains that hold claims). Continuation-sheet lines that carry
          cells and no name are not names and do not count.

          A FILE MAY DECLARE ITSELF NOT A READING, with a top-level
          `not_a_reading` sentence saying what it is instead, and then its units
          are not charged to the domain (T-0602). Newberry's
          `precision_sample.json` re-adjudicates 160 cards this domain has
          already read, to measure how good the reading is; census_1840's
          `second_readings/` re-reads two sheets independently so that a
          disagreement survives. Both were charged as fresh reading, so
          MEASURING THE READING READ THE METER UP and sampling harder made the
          domain look further behind. Every declaration is printed by `report`,
          with the units it withheld, because a file that could exempt itself in
          silence would be a hole straight through this gate.

  spent   a crosswalk entry ANCHORED to something real — a read record
          (`record_id`, `entry_id`, `claim_id`) or a person in the town
          (`person_id`, `resident`, `matched_resident`). Deduped by that anchor,
          because civic adjudicates its 479 voters in `voter_crosswalk.json`
          AND rules on name pairs in `crosswalk.json`, and summing the two array
          lengths reported civic as 571 spent against 492 read — a domain more
          than finished. An instrument that reports -79 unspent is worse than no
          instrument.

          A REFUSAL COUNTS AS SPENT. census_1840/crosswalk.json says why: "A
          refusal is declared as explicitly as a merge — the absence of one
          reads like a pair nobody has looked at yet." Ruling that a name is
          NOT a town person is the adjudication; it is not a failure to do one.

          A RULING MAY ANCHOR THROUGH ITS EVIDENCE. `evidence` and `support`
          rows that are plain strings naming a unit THIS DOMAIN HAS READ are
          anchors like any other id (T-0602): newberry's crosswalk refuses five
          headings and cites fourteen card ids between them, and counting that
          as zero said the most carefully reasoned paragraph in the domain had
          adjudicated nothing. A string that resolves to no read unit anchors
          nothing — the resolution is against the domain's own ids, so no ruling
          can talk its way into a spend.

  id pairs a merge/refusal ruling on two spellings (`a` / `b`) with no anchor.
          Reported, never counted as spend: it is a ruling about the sources'
          own vocabulary, not about whether the town gained anything. WHAT COULD
          NOT BE COUNTED IS NOW SAID OUT LOUD, per file and with the reason —
          civic writes 90 refusals whose evidence names its sources and its
          locators in prose ("poll_1835 line 293") rather than record ids, and
          the honest report of that is a printed line, not a silent zero. The
          fix for one is to write the id; guessing which record a prose locator
          meant is the kind of invention this project forbids.

  unspent read - spent. NOT a defect count. census_1830, church and books read
          nothing yet and are honestly 0/0; a domain reading ahead of a bridge
          ticket is the method working.

THE GATE is a ratchet, not a target. `unspent` may not exceed the figure in
research_spend_baseline.json. Read more and you must rule on more, or say in the
PR why the baseline moves. Raising a baseline is a decision somebody makes on
purpose; drifting past it is what happened for three weeks.

THE RATCHET HAS TWO DIRECTIONS, and only one of them costs anything. Raising a
ceiling says the project chose to read further ahead of its adjudication, so it
takes one domain and a written reason. Lowering is what SPENDING a domain earns,
can only make this gate stricter, and is therefore free. Without the second
direction the first is a slow leak: a domain spent to nothing would keep the
ceiling its worst day earned and could drift back up to it in silence.

THE THIRD HOP, and the only ratchet here whose ceiling is zero by default (T-0598).
A ruling is only spendable if something can CARRY it to a card, and
`persons[].sources` is a list of SOURCE IDS: a ruling that names a person and never
says what it rests on can be spent by nobody but a human rereading the whole
crosswalk. 103 of 109 rulings were in that state the evening this was written —
civic's voter_crosswalk matched 99 voters to residents and the string
`chicago_voter_lists_1833_1835_irad` appeared nowhere in the file adjudicating
against it. Every generated crosswalk now states its source, at the top of the file
where the whole file rests on one and per entry where a ruling rests on something
specific, and `no source stated` is held at 0. Reading further ahead of your
adjudication is a legitimate choice; ruling on a person and not saying why is not,
so no domain gets an allowance unless somebody writes one deliberately. THE FIX FOR
AN UNSOURCED RULING IS TO STATE THE SOURCE OR TO WITHDRAW THE RULING — never to
invent a plausible-looking citation, which would take this gate green on a lie.
