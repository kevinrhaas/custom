"""Position an 1835 HOME from an address printed after 1835 — T-0669.

THE FOURTH GRAMMAR, AIMED AT THE OTHER QUESTION. `tools/back_project_addresses.py`
(T-0633, policy `docs/ADDRESS-BACK-PROJECTION.md`, liberty L218) reads a street printed
four to nine years after the scene backwards and carries it as a BUSINESS's street face.
Its clause 2 refuses, by name, an address the volume itself prints as a RESIDENCE — its
own `res` or `bds` — because positioning a home is "the same mechanism aimed at a
different question", and it named this ticket as the place that question gets answered.

This file answers it. The policy is `docs/RESIDENCE-BACK-PROJECTION.md` and the liberty
is **L223**. The mechanism is deliberately the business pass's, imported rather than
copied — the same street tables, the same folding, the same 1835 street layer — because
two passes reading `Michigan ave` differently would be a worse fault than either reading.
What differs is the argument, and it differs in two places that are stated as clauses
rather than left in the code:

  R2  A HOME NEEDS NO ATTESTED TRADE, where a business does. The business pass's clause 1
      refuses a person the 1835 corpus gives no trade, and it is right to: there is no
      business for a later door to place, and minting one out of an 1844 directory is the
      thing that pass may never do. A residence is not that claim. Everybody the town
      holds lived somewhere in it, so an absent occupation removes nothing, and this pass
      therefore adjudicates every residence-printed address rather than the handful whose
      person also happens to carry a trade.

  R5  A FACE, AND NEVER A POINT, where a business may reach a crossing. The business pass
      resolves `cor.` and `near` onto the point where two committed centrelines meet. A
      home does not get one here, for two reasons written out in the policy: the corner
      words in these entries hang off street NUMBERS from a grid 1835 did not have, and a
      dwelling moves more than a shopfront does. The extra precision would be this pass
      claiming most exactly where its evidence is thinnest.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It writes no `lives_at`. `docs/STREET-FACE-ADOPTION.md` limit 3 says
dealing a household to one roof on a face is an allocation and not a reading; stacking
that on an address already carried back eight years would be two inventions under one
chip. `--self-test` asserts it rather than the prose promising it.
