"""measure_chappel_shore_lighthouse.py — can the lighthouse settle what the Eliza
Chappel shore drawing depicts?

T-0649. T-0617 deposited a fifth image beside the four attested Sauganash views and
deliberately did NOT spend it, because its subject is unsettled:

  (a) it is Eliza Chappell's FIRST school of September 1833 — the "small log house
      formerly used as a store" that the Beaubien material calls Mark Beaubien's own
      original cabin beside the Sauganash at Lake and Market — in which case the
      drawing is a fifth, nearly square-on view of the Sauganash's log annex; or
  (b) it is some other log schoolhouse and leaves the Sauganash entirely.

The ticket names the control: **the lighthouse is read rather than eyeballed.** The
tower's drawn position and proportions, the bank's bearing and the log building's
orientation, taken together, either say which corner of the town the view stands on
or say — with the number that shows it — that they cannot. This file is that reading,
and `docs/RESEARCH/chappel_shore_lighthouse.md` is where it is graded.

THE TWO SHEETS
--------------
`chicago/reference/images/chicago/eliza-chappel-school/21617595_…_n.jpg`, 640 x 368 —
the drawing under test. A log building at the right with a woman in its doorway,
children on the bank, canoes afloat and hauled up, a white tower on a low point in the
middle distance, and a scatter of small gabled buildings on a flat prairie horizon.

`chicago/reference/images/chicago/chicago_harbor_lighthouse_1838.jpg`, 640 x 361 —
the control: the 1832 tower drawn from the river with Fort Dearborn beside it.

Both are small. The drawn tower is about 13 px across, and every ratio below carries
that: an edge is worth +/- 1 px, so a width ratio is worth +/- 15 %. The file reports
the error band rather than hiding it, because the whole point of T-0197 is that a
number nobody can check is worse than no number.

WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHY THESE AND NOT OTHERS
----------------------------------------------
The decisive test is FOCAL-FREE, which is what makes it worth running on a sheet this
small. For anything standing on one flat ground plane, seen from one station,

    drawn height / (base depression below the horizon)  =  H / h_eye

and the right-hand side does not depend on the distance, the focal length, or the size
of the sheet. So the ratio r = drawn/(y_base - y_horizon) must be THE SAME for every
adult in the picture, wherever they stand. Measuring r for four adults at four depths
therefore tests the drawing itself, before any question about Chicago is asked.

Given r, every pair of objects fixes a height RATIO: r_i / r_j = H_i / H_j. So the
tower's height follows from an adult's, in metres, with no perspective assumption at
all — and the answer can be compared with the forty feet Andreas gives the 1832 tower
and `data/structures/chicago_lighthouse_1832.json` carries.

The station then needs one more thing the sheet does not give: the focal length. What
the file reports instead is the focal length the Sauganash corner WOULD require, from
the committed coordinates of `sauganash_hotel` and `chicago_lighthouse_1832`, and the
field of view that implies. A reader can then judge it against the picture in front of
them, which is a judgement a detector should not pretend to make.

WHAT IS NOT MEASURED, AND WHY THE FILE SAYS SO
----------------------------------------------
* The tower's TAPER. The shaft is 13 px wide over 20 px of visible height; a taper of
  the size a masonry tower of the period carries is under a pixel across that run, and
  in the control sheet the tower's right edge is lost in foliage below the gallery.
  The comparison is therefore made on the SIGNATURE — railed gallery, domed lantern,
  finial, and the gallery's overhang — and the file states what that can and cannot
  exclude.
* The log building itself. This ticket does not spend the view on the annex; it only
  measures the building's ORIENTATION, because the ticket names it as one of the three
  things read together.
