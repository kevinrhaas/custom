"""Read St Mary's baptismal register 1833-1835 off its eleven deposited page images.

WHAT THIS IS. `chicago/reference/catholic-baptisms-1833-1835/` holds eleven
FamilySearch page images (`S3HT-DHG9-*.jpg`) of the register Father John Mary
Irenaeus St. Cyr opened at Chicago in May 1833. They are the ONLY primary record
this project has that names a family together — a child, two parents and two
sponsors on one dated line — and until T-0503 nothing had been read out of them.

The deposit is READ-ONLY and no scan or render is ever committed. What is committed
is this file: the reading itself, held as a table, with `--build` emitting the
records and the claims and `--check` proving the emitted JSON is still exactly what
this table says. A hand-edit of the JSON is therefore a gate failure, which is the
point — the transcription and the artifact cannot drift apart.

THE GRADE. Every row here is `scan_verified`: read off the page image, not out of a
transcription. That is the higher of the two readings this project recognises and it
is why these rows outrank the marriage register's, which came through the Illinois
Catholic Historical Review by way of Genealogy Trails.

`as_read` keeps the clerk's own spelling, his Latin and French forms, his
abbreviations (`8bre` October, `9bre` November, `10bre` December) and his
inconsistencies. An unread letter is `[?]`; a word read with real doubt carries the
doubt in `notes` and drops the row's confidence to `inferred`. `normalized` is this
project's spelling of the same person and is never merged back into `as_read`.

WHAT THE REGISTER IS NOT. A baptism documents a person at a font on a day. It is not
a residence, not an address and not an occupation. Nothing here mints or regrades a
resident; T-0514 and T-0515 do that, from the consolidation.

AND IT IS NOT ALL CHICAGO. Entries 1-11 of 1834 were written on St. Cyr's journey
back from St. Louis, at Bear Creek, the South Fork of the Sangamon and Springfield,
in Sangamon County. Those rows carry `at_chicago: false` themselves — the same trap
the marriage page set, and the reason `data/research/church/README.md` warns about it.
