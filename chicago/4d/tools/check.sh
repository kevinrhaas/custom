# simply there — and `check_published.mjs` ran under an `if [ -d ]` guard that made a
# fresh checkout skip the gate silently. It is untracked and .gitignored now (see
# /.gitignore for the measurement), which turns that assumption into an absence: a
# clone has no mirror at all until something publishes one.
#
# So the gate publishes one, here, before anything reads it. That is not a workaround;
# it is the honest reading of what check_published.mjs asserts. The claim was never
# "the mirror somebody committed matches its source" — it was "what publish.sh produces
# matches its source", and with the mirror off the PR surface that is the only reading
# left. Everything downstream now measures a mirror this run made, so a stale one is
# not a state that can exist.
#
# It costs about a second (measured: 1.0 s on a warm tree), and it is a REAL publish
# rather than a `--dry-run`, so publish.sh's own refusals — a derivative that no longer
# answers for its master — fail the gate here rather than at deploy time.

# cold branch for five days as the topmost queue line carrying no PR — the exact
# shape of available work — and a run rebuilt the whole block, 116 files and 5,827
# insertions, onto records already on `dev` under the same ids.

# list, which is the only honest demonstration of a check whose correct answer
# against the real `dev` changes hourly. What it holds is the three refusals that
# make the report trustworthy — a queue-keeping title ("File T-0968: …", "Pull
# T-0802 up…", "Rank T-0727 under…", three real merged PRs that touched none of the
# work they name) is not a claim of authorship, a `done` or `blocked-owner` ticket is

# than a run", which is false about it twice over. Cohort 14 (T-0509) was read twice on
# 2026-09-05 by two runs that could not see each other; the ledgers disagreed on 36 of
# the 76 people and T-0816 had to adjudicate every one.
#
# The reading now takes TWO witnesses, and the second is what keeps the fix honest. The
# ticket file saying `claimed` is necessary and not sufficient — T-0987 is worked one
# stretch per run and sits `claimed` on `dev` permanently, so the file alone reported
# seven of its long-merged branches as in flight. The CLAIM LOCK is the other: it is
# taken with the claim and released by `done`, so it lives exactly as long as the run.
# Held is reported as in flight and SAID to be a long read or a dead one, because
# T-0429's fault runs the opposite way and must stay visible.
#
# The gate runs it on a CONSTRUCTED branch list for the reason `landed` does: the right

# THE WRITE HOP OF THE SAME CROSSWALK, and the half T-0698 was actually still owed. The
# gate above proves the adjudication re-derives; it says nothing about whether the ruling
# ever reached the person it names. Measured on dev before this pass: 27 heads ruled
# `matched` or `candidate`, and 12 of the 27 cards carried the source at all — Philo
# Carpenter, John Calhoun, Ira Couch and George W. Dole among the twelve MATCHES whose
# cards had never been told. `measure_research_spend.py` read census_1840 as fully spent
# throughout — 27 reached, 27 written — while that was true of twelve of them.
#
# WHY it read green is corrected here (T-0962), because the reason recorded above it was
# wrong and a wrong reason is worse than none: it retires the question. The hop did NOT
# fail to look at resident_crosswalk.json — `is_crosswalk()` is a substring test and that
# file has always satisfied it, and re-running 577c2f6f5's tool over 577c2f6f5's tree
# reproduces the 27 out of its `heads`, 12 matched + 15 candidate. What passed them is the
# FILE-LEVEL SOURCE FALLBACK: a head stating no discriminators of its own is judged against
# the one source id at the top of the file, and the cards already cited it from the earlier
# bridge pass. A meter that cannot see a hop reports it green; so does one that asks too
# little.
#
# T-0989 closed that fallback rather than merely holding it. A ruling stating no source of
# its own is still judged against its file's, and that still makes it JUDGEABLE — but to
# count written the card must now also NAME what the ruling adjudicated: the read unit it
# cites, or the sheet a sheet-and-line ruling sits on. The old test asked only whether the
# card cited the file's one source id, which every ruling in the file shares, so a citation
# put there by any other pass passed all of them at once. Closing it moved one figure and
# it was not tuned back: directories fell from 914 of 914 written to 659, and the 255 is in
# the write ceiling with the reason beside it.
#
# T-0670 met the same wall from the other side, hit the ceiling on ONE ruling and reverted
# rather than rule. `spend_census_1840_heads.py` is that ruling taken generally: whatever
# the crosswalk reaches, the card is told — a MATCH as a match, and a CANDIDATE in a

# repairs, and the ex-officio coroners are held to the gap they are printed in. And the

# what matters is the LINE the file stands on. It is built from an extract that carries 55
# transcribed head-of-household names and 964 household serials, and the whole value of the
# summary is that it is counts and nothing else — 1840 household members are never minted
# into 1835 from census counts, which is the owner's own rule. --self-test refuses the build
# if a single one of those names or serials reaches the output, and --check refuses a
# committed file that no longer re-derives from the extract and from T-0504's column_map. A
# hand-edited count in there would be a fact about this town that nobody counted.

# from seven domains that each move on their own ticket. A source read on Tuesday that
# never reaches the master is the exact failure the owner named ("there are not outputs or
# updates to the household and resident data"), and it looks like nothing at all until
# somebody rebuilds by hand. --check rebuilds from the domains and fails if the committed
# files have drifted; the invariants it holds are the acceptance's own — one row per
# identity, no record claimed by two identities, every refusal carrying a rule that exists,
# and no row graded above what its rung of the ratified ladder allows.

# from, and because the one way this file could do harm is by quietly acquiring a

# coverage, and it says nothing about the next duplicate. Three of the four minting passes
# test "does the town already carry this person?" by SURNAME, and that proxy is partial by
# design — each skips the households minted by itself and by the passes below it, so a card
# one of those wrote is invisible to it. `identity_master_guard.py` is the precise
# instrument for that blind spot: it hands a candidate name to the master's own `cluster()`,
# inside its own surname bucket, with every identity of that surname standing as an anchor
# whether it holds a card or not, and refuses only where the master itself merges. Gated
# because the whole value of it is that it is the master's answer and not a hand copy — a
# first draft written out by hand reported 19 committed cards as duplicates where the master
# reports 2, because a copy of M2 cannot see the rivals that HOLD a merge apart.
