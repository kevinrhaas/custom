"""Generate the town's dooryard garden pickets — the enclosure layer's third record.

WHAT THIS IS. `docs/ROADMAP.md` K5 (a) cites the Kinzie-view plate for *"picket-fenced
garden plots and Lombardy poplars"* and says in the same breath what the citation is
worth: it is a reference for TREATMENT, and the house itself stays excluded from the
1835 scene. So this project has a picture of what a garden fence in this town looked
like and not one word about where any of them stood. That asymmetry is the whole
difficulty of ticket T-0052, and it is why the answer is a RULE rather than a list:
the record has to be able to say, of every fence it draws, on what basis that
particular lot got one.

THE RULE, and every clause of it is doing work. A lot gets a dooryard picket iff

  1. it is a platted lot in `data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json` — so the ground
     the fence stands on is the committed plat grid and not a shape invented here;
  2. exactly ONE committed building centre stands in it — a lot shared with a shop, a
     stable or a second dwelling has no undivided dooryard this record could bound,
     and guessing where the division ran would be an invention on top of an invention;
  3. that building is a dwelling by BOTH archetype (`frame_dwelling` / `log_dwelling`)
     and function (`dwelling`, or a cottage/house band of the reconstruction
     schedule) — the Mansion House, Eliza Chappel's infant school and the Temple
     Building all sit alone on a platted lot and none of them is a house lot;
  4. a household is recorded as living there. A garden is a HOUSEHOLD'S. John Wright's
     two buildings to let are excluded by this clause and by their own records, which
     say in as many words that "the honest reading of 'to let' is a building whose
     tenant this project cannot name";
  5. the plot the first four clauses leave — the rear of the lot, clear of the house
     and inside the lot lines — is big enough to be a garden and hits no other
     building's committed footprint.

Every metre of every perimeter below is then DERIVED from the committed lot polygon
and the committed footprint. Nothing here is hand-placed, which is what makes 23
garden fences auditable rather than 23 numbers someone typed; `--check` re-derives the
record byte for byte in `tools/check.sh`.

WHAT IS INVENTED is the treatment and the plot geometry — the fence type, its height,
its pale rhythm, the size of the plot, its position at the back of the lot and the gate
in its house-facing side. All of it is graded `reconstructed` and claimed in
`docs/LIBERTIES.md` L129. No source states that any of these particular households kept
a garden, and this record never says one did: it says the town's house lots are drawn
with the plate's treatment, and names the rule that chose them.
