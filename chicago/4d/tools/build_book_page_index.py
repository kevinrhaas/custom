"""Page boundaries for a committed book text that has none.

    tools/build_book_page_index.py --build   re-derive the index (needs pdftotext)
    tools/build_book_page_index.py --check   the gate (committed files only)
    tools/build_book_page_index.py --self-test

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `data/research/books/` commits the TEXT it quotes from, and
the gate in `tools/research_domains.py` rebuilds every quote out of that text by
line number. For Hubbard's autobiography the text this project was told to commit
is the Internet Archive's own OCR output,
`https://archive.org/download/autobiographyofg00hubb/autobiographyofg00hubb_djvu.txt`
— and that file carries NO page breaks at all. Zero form feeds, no folios of its
own, nothing that says where leaf 65 stops and leaf 66 starts.

That is a problem, because a book's locator is a PAGE. `coverage.json` already
records the shape of this fault once: Hurlbut's chapter is declared as one `list`
item and not as nine `page` items, because "declaring nine pages would mean
assigning each claim to a page nobody has seen, which is an invention, and the
gate would then be checking a fiction rather than a reading."

The deposited scan, `chicago/reference/swift-walker-autobiography/
autobiographyofg00hubb.pdf`, carries the SAME OCR in a text layer that DOES have
all 226 leaf breaks. So the page boundaries are not invented here — they are
transferred, mechanically, from the one artifact that holds them onto the one this
repo quotes from, and this file is that transfer written down so it can be redone
and disputed.

HOW. `pdftotext -layout` splits the deposit into 226 leaves. Both texts are
whitespace-normalised; a single `difflib.SequenceMatcher` pass over the two
normalised strings gives the correspondence (they agree to better than 0.9999,
their OCR being the same OCR); each leaf's normalised start is carried across and
mapped back to a raw offset, and thence to a 1-based line number in the committed
text. Where a leaf's opening words cannot be located the entry is written with
`aligned: false` and no claim may cite it.

WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS READ. The leaf number is mechanical. The PRINTED folio
is not: it is read off the foot of the leaf where the OCR gives it, and where the
OCR does not, it is carried by the constant offset that the read folios establish
— which is recorded per entry as `folio_source`: `read` or `offset`. Nothing here
authors a claim.
