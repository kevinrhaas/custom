"""Norris's 1844 ADVERTISING DIRECTORY against the 1835 residents (T-0568).

    tools/crosswalk_norris_1844_advertiser.py [--check]

The only place a name on an 1844 advertising card is allowed to touch a person
standing in the scene of 1 July 1835. It touches them as CORROBORATION and as a
CANDIDATE trade, never as an 1835 fact: under the ratified grading ladder an 1844
listing alone never makes an 1835 resident, and nothing here regrades anybody or
writes a business. The file this writes is a proposal for T-0569, which spends it.

THE RULE, written out so it reads back without the code:
  A card names PROPRIETORS. Each proprietor whose printed name carries both a
  surname and a given name or initial is compared against every person in the
  residents layer. The SURNAME must match after both are folded (case, punctuation
  and the scanner's standing confusions removed) AND the first initials must agree.
  A surname-only agreement is a REFUSAL, however good it looks — Norris lists
  eleven Smiths, and a card that says only "Skinner & Smith" says two surnames and
  nothing else. Where an 1835 person meets more than one card on that rule the match
  is AMBIGUOUS and is filed as such, not resolved; where two 1835 people meet THE
  SAME PRINTED PROPRIETOR the match is CONTESTED and is not made.

  A CONTEST IS BETWEEN TWO READINGS OF ONE PRINTED NAME, NOT TWO NAMES ON ONE CARD
  (T-0987, stretch 2). A card is a firm's advertisement and names its partners: card
  n1844_ad0046 prints "A. Loyd" AND "H. A. Blakesley", and the two 1835 residents who
  meet them meet a name each. Keying the contest on the card alone made rivals of
  partners — of men the card says stood in business TOGETHER — and withheld three
  matches the rule had already made. The key is the printed proprietor.

WHAT A MATCH IS WORTH, and it is less than it looks. An advertising card is a
SUBSCRIPTION: the firms in this section are the ones that paid Norris, so the
section is not the town's trades but the part of them with money for display type in
1844. A match therefore says that a surname and an initial the 1835 layer holds also
stood over a Chicago shop nine years later. That is corroboration of continuity and
a candidate trade, and the carry, when T-0569 makes it, is stated as 1844 evidence.
