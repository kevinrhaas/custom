"""Generate the town's dooryard plantings — kept trees and bushes around the houses.

WHAT THIS IS. Ticket T-0074, from the owner's 2026-08-18 brief: *"there should be...
more trees and greenery around the houses like people would have put or kept some
trees and bushes around their houses."* The reference is image 12 of
`data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md` — the circa-1833 view looking
east, where trees and bushes stand close around the houses, kept deliberately —
and the committed Kinzie plate agrees (its poplar row was planted, not wild). Today
the woody layer is prairie-driven: distribution follows the land, so houses stand on
bare grass. This tool gives the town's houses their dooryard stems, the way
T-0052 gave its house lots their garden pickets: by a RULE, not a list, so the
record can say of every stem on what basis that particular house got it.

THE RULE. A committed structure gets dooryard stems iff

  1. its archetype is a dwelling's (`frame_dwelling` / `log_dwelling`) and its
     function reads as a dwelling — the same two clauses T-0052 uses, for the same
     reason: a tavern yard or a store frontage is a different ground with different
     uses, and the one tavern yard with evidence behind it (the Sauganash's,
     T-0091) is already carried by its own hand-authored record;
  2. a deterministic deal seeded on the structure id gives it 0-2 kept trees and
     0-2 currant bushes — dealt, because no source counts any house's trees, and
     seeded, because a re-run must re-derive the same town (`--check` diffs it);
  3. every stem stands where the renderer's own refusals allow: clear of every
     committed footprint by more than trees.js's CLEAR_MARGIN, off every street's
     travelled track by more than streets.js's shoulder, above the dry floor,
     outside every committed fence line, and clear of its neighbours.

WHAT THE SPECIES ARE, and why nothing here is new ecology. Every stem names a
species `data/flora/zones/z10_settled_town.json` already records: the settled
town's relict survivors (American elm, eastern cottonwood — "Survivor elm in a
part-cleared block") for the trees, and its dooryard currants (`ribes_spp`, whose
own record note says currants inside the town box are inferred from the Fort
Dearborn garden and Dr. Harmon's nursery) for the bushes. WHETHER A GIVEN TREE WAS
KEPT OR PLANTED IS NOT CLAIMED, because it is not knowable: the ticket's own brief
has settlers doing both, the timber belt's documented east end (Wells Street in
the South Division, the sandy hills exception in the North) means most house lots
stood on ground with nothing to keep, and a transplanted elm or cottonwood — the
period's two quick dooryard shades — is the same species either way. Tree heights
sit in the LOW third of each species' recorded band: T-0091's cut-back argument
for a kept tree, and a young transplant for a planted one, land in the same third.

WHAT IS INVENTED is every coordinate, every count and every height — graded
`reconstructed` and claimed in `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L151. The Lombardy poplars the
ticket also names are NOT dealt: no committed flora zone record describes the
species, and a planting record may not invent a tree the zone records do not
carry (trees.js refuses the stem). Holding the poplar as a species is its own
ticket.
