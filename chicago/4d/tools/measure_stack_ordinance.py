"""Eighteen inches of stack above every roof — the town's own by-law, measured.

**T-0333.** The Trustees of the Town of Chicago passed their by-laws on 5 August 1835,
and `chicago_democrat_1835_08_19#c005` prints section 18 line by line:

> *"every stove pipe or chimney passing through the roof of any building shall extend
> and be carried at least eighteen inches above the roof, and no stove pipe shall be
> passed through the side or end of any building"* — under a penalty of five dollars for
> each and every offence, with a fire warden walking every house, store and shop in his
> district once a month from September to May (section 21).

**This is the first documented DIMENSIONAL constraint this project holds on anything
above a roof line**, and it points the other way from the sentence the flagstaff work
quotes — Andreas describing a town with *"not a single steeple nor a chimney four feet
above any roof."* Four feet is a maximum a memoirist noticed; eighteen inches is a
minimum the town enforced, and together they bracket every stack in the scene.

## What it measures, and why on the bytes

`tools/measure_stack_fabric.py` (T-0137) asks what a stack is PAINTED and reads the
committed masters' accessor bounds to do it. This asks the neighbouring question — how
far a stack stands above the roof it passes through — off the same bounds and on the
same principle: **the generator is the thing under test, so ask the geometry, not the
generator.** A glTF POSITION accessor is required to carry `min`/`max`, so the highest
vertex of each material is readable from the JSON chunk with no mesh decoded.

The clearance is measured against the top of the `roof` material, which is the RIDGE.
That is the conservative reading in the two ways it can be wrong:

- A stack standing off the ridge — `frame_storefront` on a shed roof, `frame_tavern`
  across the frontage — breaks a roof plane LOWER than the ridge, so its true projection
  above its own roof is larger than the figure here.
- A building carrying stacks on two roofs (a `frame_dwelling` ell, a `log_dwelling`
  frame addition) reports its TALLEST stack. That the lower one clears its own ridge by
  the same margin is the archetype's guarantee, not this measurement's: every archetype
  builds each stack with one helper, relative to the ridge it is handed. Said plainly
  here rather than left for a reader to assume.

## What the ordinance's second clause binds, which is nothing today

*"No stove pipe shall be passed through the side or end of any building."* **This model
draws no stove pipe anywhere.** Every one of the stacks below is masonry — brick on the
argument `docs/RESEARCH/chimneys.md` makes from Blodgett's yard, the brick Lake House and
the Petford watercolour — and the archetypes carry no pipe object at all. `log_dwelling`'s
stack stands OUTSIDE the gable rather than inside it, which is the frontier pattern and
not a pipe through an end wall: it is a chimney, and it is carried above the roof like
every other. So the clause is recorded and binds nothing that is drawn.

## The corporation limits, and why this gate is a ratchet rather than an enforcement

Section 18 binds *"within the limits of the Corporation"*, and section 22 of the same
sitting walks those limits street by street — the only documented statement in this
corpus of where the built town was held to end in the scene year. **This project does not
draw that boundary yet; T-0334 owns it.** So this gate deliberately does not decide which
buildings the by-law reaches. It does not conform anything: every stack in the town
already clears eighteen inches, on both sides of a line nobody has drawn, and what the
gate holds is that none may drop back under it. The day a record legitimately stands a
shorter stack outside the limits, T-0334's boundary is what scopes this gate, and the
failure message says so rather than leaving the next reader to work it out.
