"""T-1350: a RULED READING supersedes the bound a mint derives, and cannot be reverted.

THE HOLE THIS CLOSES. Four passes mint `data/residents/households/*.json` from their
registers and derive `arrival` as a `not_later_than` BOUND — the earliest day a
committed record names the person, never the day they came. That is the right default
and it is the whole of what those registers can say. But a reading sometimes says more:
Moses and Kirkland's list of the spring of 1833 names men the town's paper does not
print until a year later, and their Baptist catalogue of 19 October 1833 puts three men
in the settlement two months before the tax roll gets to them. A reading like that
SUPERSEDES the derived bound.

Until now it could not. `carry_stage_blocks.carry()` carries a reconstruction stage's
blocks back across a mint's rewrite, and there was no equivalent for a reading, so a
hand-written `arrival` survived exactly until the next `--build` and then went away
without a word. T-1340 spent fifty-two book rulings onto the layer, watched seven of
them fail to reach the cards the crosswalk had already joined them to, and wrote the
failure down rather than leaving it as a silence. This is the mechanism it wanted.

WHAT IT IS. A committed ledger — `data/research/residents/arrival_supersessions.json`
— naming, per household, the reading that supersedes the mint's bound, the crosswalk
merge that joins that reading to this card, the derived bound AS IT STOOD when the
ruling was made, and the block to write instead. The mints consult it where they derive
`arrival`, so everything downstream of the field — including the person note
`mint_civic_residents.py` composes out of it — is written from the superseded value.

WHAT IT IS NOT, AND THE FOUR REFUSALS THAT KEEP IT SO. It is not a way to write any
date onto any card:

  1. NO IDENTITY IS MADE HERE. An entry must name a merge already committed to a
     crosswalk, in that crosswalk's own words. Joining a reading to a card is the
     crosswalk's job and stays there; this file only spends a join that exists.
  2. NO READING IS INVENTED HERE. An entry must name a claim id that exists in the
     claims file it names, and the source must be in `data/sources/`.
  3. A SUPERSESSION MUST SUPERSEDE. The ruled value has to be EARLIER than the bound
     it replaces. A reading no earlier than the register's own bound tells the card
     nothing it does not already hold, and an entry that moved a date LATER would be
     loosening a bound while claiming to tighten one.
  4. THE GRADE CEILING IS THE SOURCE'S. A claim read `transcription_mediated` may not
     be graded above `inferred`, whatever it plainly prints — the rule T-1322 set for
     the settlers table of this same compiler, kept here.

AND THE DRIFT IS LOUD, WHICH IS THE POINT. Each entry banks the derived bound it was
ruled against. If a mint hands this module a DIFFERENT bound — the register grew a
column, an identity gained an appearance — the ruling was made against evidence that
has moved, and `supersede()` REFUSES rather than overwriting the new bound with an old
ruling. A human re-rules and re-banks. That is the opposite of the failure above: the
old behaviour lost the reading in silence, this one stops the build and says which
card and which two dates.
