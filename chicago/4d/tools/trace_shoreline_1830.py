"""Trace the PRE-CUT mouth of the Chicago River off the Harrison 1830 harbour plan.

The western companion to `tools/trace_shoreline.py` in subject and its opposite in
date. That tool traces the harbour AFTER the 1833-34 cut, off Wright 1834. This one
traces the same ground BEFORE it: the main stem running east past Fort Dearborn, the
bend south at the reservation, and the old southward channel behind the sand bar —
the water the cut destroyed, and the only shore an 1812 scene can stand on.

    python3 tools/trace_shoreline_1830.py            re-trace and write the GeoJSON
    python3 tools/trace_shoreline_1830.py --check    re-trace and diff against committed
    python3 tools/trace_shoreline_1830.py --debug    also write a PNG of the segmentation

THE SHEET, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE. `harrison_1830_river_mouth` is a U.S. civil
engineer's survey of the mouth, drawn February 1830 to show the proposed harbour
improvements — that is, drawn to record the mouth as it stood before anyone improved
it. It is the only plan this project holds that draws the natural outlet. It letters
the features this trace needs in the draughtsman's own hand: "Old Mouth of River very
shallow", "Sand" and "Gravel" over the bar, "Beach", and — the one thing that must NOT
come forward to 1812 — "Channel cut by the Soldiers in 1828".

THE TRANSFORM IS NOT RE-DERIVED HERE. It is the one T-0883 stated and T-0882 checked
against the same raster: the plate rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise so its own north
arrow stands vertical, the stockade's ink centre at pixel (1445, 644) hung on the
committed palisade's local E +1152, N +221, and 0.33528 m per pixel — the 1.10 ft/px
scale docs/RESEARCH/fort_dearborn.md section 3 derives from the commandant's quarters.
This tool asserts the stockade ink still falls in its stated window before it uses it,
so a different scan or a different rotation stops the trace rather than moving a shore.

WHAT COMES OUT, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. The hachure field is the water: this
engraving shades the water side of every shore and leaves the land white, so the water
body is the dense-ink region and the shore is its boundary. What the boundary is NOT,
everywhere, is a shore — east of the bar the lake's hachures simply thin out and stop,
and that edge is where the engraver's ruling pen stopped, not where Lake Michigan
began. So a boundary vertex is published only where the draughtsman drew a LINE under
it: the crisp shore stroke, found as ink that is a ridge rather than a step, within
`ink_near_px`. Runs that survive that test are claimed by hand-placed anchors; runs no
anchor claims are dropped and counted. Nothing here publishes a lake edge, and nothing
here publishes the 1828 soldiers' channel — see EXCLUDED below.
