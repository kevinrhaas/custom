"""Did the content bake produce CONTENT, or only its own build stamp? (T-0180)

`chicago-4d-bake.yml` decided whether a nightly had produced anything with
`[ -z "$(git status --porcelain)" ]`. That test can never say no. `publish.sh`
IS the build, and the last thing it writes is the build stamp — the head sha and
a wall clock — into `site/chicago/4d/build.json` and into the gate paragraph of
`site/chicago/4d/walk/index.html`. Both move on every run by construction, so
the tree was always dirty, the `changed=0` branch was unreachable, and every
bake opened a PR whose whole diff was two files and no geometry. Four of them
were open at once on 2026-08-24, and the signal a reviewer needs — *this bake
rebuilt something* — fired identically whether 300 structures had been rebuilt
or nothing at all had.

So the question is asked of the content instead. A dirty path is STAMP-ONLY when
it is one of the two the stamp is written into AND the only thing that moved in
it is the stamp; everything else is content. That is deliberately narrower than
"exclude those two paths": `build.json` growing a real field, or the gate page
changing anywhere but its stamp paragraph, is content and still opens a PR.

Two traps this must not fall into, both recorded on T-0180:

  * The stamp is NOT stopped. It is written, it ships with the next PR that
    carries real content, and the gate screen keeps reading it. What stops is
    the stamp MANUFACTURING that PR.
  * The stamp can never be self-consistent with the commit carrying it —
    merging it changes the head sha it names. Inherent, not a fault to chase.
