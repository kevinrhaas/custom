 * T-0235 — what the renderer gate COSTS on this machine, and which parts of it
 * cover the change you actually made.
 *
 *   node tools/smoke_budget.mjs                    # the measured cost of the whole gate
 *   node tools/smoke_budget.mjs --for <path>…      # the parts that cover those files
 *   node tools/smoke_budget.mjs --for-diff [ref]   # the same, off `git diff --name-only`
 *   node tools/smoke_budget.mjs --legs             # the nightly gate leg by leg, vs its cap
 *   node tools/smoke_budget.mjs --self-test        # the map has not rotted (check.sh)
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A steward run's single foreground command is capped at 600 s,
 * so no run can take the gate whole: it takes the parts that cover what it
 * touched, and until this tool nothing said which those are. A run therefore
 * either ran all fifteen commands — more than its whole budget — or picked by
 * feel.
 *
 * THERE ARE THREE CAPS AND THEY BOUND THREE DIFFERENT THINGS (T-0450). This
 * file used to say the 30-minute cap T-0170, T-0173 and T-0181 reason against
 * "describes some other machine", and offered the gate's 55 m 10 s whole-body
 * figure as the proof. It is not proof, because the two are not the same
 * quantity, and the machine is the same one:
 *   - 600 s   caps ONE FOREGROUND COMMAND in a steward run — this tool's budget;
 *   - 30 min  caps ONE LEG of the nightly gate (`chicago-4d-bake.yml` § `smoke`,
 *             `timeout-minutes`), one viewport over one range of parts, eight
 *             legs in parallel — which is the bound those three tickets take
 *             their margins against, correctly;
 *   - 90 min  caps the WHOLE body in one process (`chicago-4d-smoke.yml`
 *             § `smoke`, `timeout-minutes`), which has no per-leg cap at all,
 *             and is what the 55 m 10 s reading was taken under.
 * Neither of the last two bounds the other. `--legs` totals the record against
 * the per-leg cap; the default report totals it against the whole-body one.
 *
 * THE FIGURES ARE READ, NEVER ASSERTED. Every second printed here comes out of
 * `tools/dev-smoke-state.json`, the standing record T-0216 built, filtered to
 * readings taken ON THIS CLASS OF MACHINE (`host.kind: steward-runner`) against
 * the published mirror. Nothing here is a bar, a gate or a promise — it is the
 * record, summarised, with the parts it has no reading for named as such. When
 * the town grows and the parts get re-cut again, the numbers move on their own.
 *
 * THE MAP CAN ONLY EVER ADD PARTS. A path the map does not know maps to THE
 * WHOLE GATE, not to nothing — so a file nobody thought about makes the recipe
 * bigger rather than quietly making it smaller. `--self-test` holds that, holds
 * the part count against `smoke_renderer.mjs`'s own `PARTS`, and holds every
 * pattern in the map against the committed tree, so a renamed module shows up
 * here rather than as a part that silently stopped being recommended.
 *
 * THE NUMBERING CHANGED THREE TIMES ON 2026-08-30, and this tool holds every
 * epoch. T-0346 made old part 4 into 4 + 5 + 6 and old 5-9 into 7-11; T-0173
 * halved part 7 (8-11 -> 9-12); T-0170 halved part 10 (11-12 -> 12-13).
 * Readings filed before any of those are labelled in the numbering of their day,
 * and this tool RENUMBERS them rather than discarding them, pushing each reading
 * through every cut it predates — the content of old part 5 is the content of
 * new parts 7+8, so the reading is a reading of that group. Three readings
 * cannot be renumbered to a single part and are reported as the group they are:
 * old part 4 is 4+5+6, a T-0346-era part 7 is 7+8, and a T-0173-era part 10 is
 * 10+11.
