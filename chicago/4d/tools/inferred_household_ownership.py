WHY A FIELD-LEVEL CONTRACT AND NOT BYTE-IDENTITY.

The three passes — `generate_inferred_households.py`, `generate_inferred_names.py`,
`replace_invented_residents.py` — are one pipeline, and on 2026-09-02 the owner's
T-0489 ruling retired the reconstructed resident population it exists to produce,
keeping the geometry as anonymous stock. Nothing told the generators. They went on
deriving the whole retired layer, so every `--check` went red against a tree that
is no longer their derivation: 96 households missing, 31 roofs stripped of their
occupant, four more records carrying later tickets' edits, and the five survivors
absorbed into the resident research layer.

Byte-identity is therefore the WRONG CONTRACT for these passes, for exactly the
reason T-0662 already found for the letter-list mint: they are not the last writer
of the files they derive. Re-running them in write mode is a REVERSAL of an owner
ruling, and a `--check` that demands the whole file back is asking for that
reversal once per commit.

So the contract is field-level, and it has two halves, both of them checked:

  A. OWNED-FIELD EXACTNESS — for every field a pass is still the last writer of,
     the tree must equal what the pass derives. Non-circular: the expectation
     comes from the authored programme, not from the tree.

  B. WITHDRAWAL INTACTNESS — for every field some ruling or later pass took off
     it, the tree must still satisfy that ruling's own shape. Also non-circular:
     the expectation is a stated rule, checked against the tree. This is what
     stops a withdrawal from being a hole in the gate — a retired household that
     reappears, or an `occupants` block that stops saying "anonymous stock", goes
     red here rather than passing unnoticed because nobody compares it.

The settlement itself — which records, which paths, and the ticket that took each
withdrawn one — is authored data, not code:
`data/reconstruction/1835_inferred_household_pass_ownership.json`.
