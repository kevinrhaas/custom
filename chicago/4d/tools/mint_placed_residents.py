WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND WHY IT IS A DIFFERENT PASS FROM T-0376's.

`tools/mint_documented_residents.py` takes the register's `new_resident` people who
carry a TRADE: the paper prints what they did, and the trade is the anchor that puts
them in the town. This pass takes the rest of the non-letter-list half — 392 people
today whom the corpus names in a proceedings column, a public card, a shipping notice
or an advertisement and for whom `data/research/newspapers/register_1835.json` reads
no occupation at all. (The 1,536 known only from the post office's letter lists are
T-0374's, and are excluded here by the register's own `letter_list_only` flag.)

THE HARD PART IS NOT THE MINTING, IT IS THE RESIDENCY TEST, so it is stated first.

A name printed in a Chicago paper is not a Chicago resident. T-0376's refusals already
showed what this pool is full of: 'A. A. Barber' is one of sixty-three signatures on a
card thanking a steamboat captain for a trip from Buffalo, and the only place the
corpus gives him is Green Bay. With no trade to argue from, the test has to be built
out of what the corpus itself says about PLACE and about COMPANY, and it has to be
derived rather than judged — a hand-picked list of the people who "look like"
residents is exactly the invention this project exists not to make.

  A NOTE ON THE WORD "PLACED", because it reads as a lot/plat position and is not
  one. Every household this pass mints carries `"division": "unplaced"` — nobody
  here has been placed on a parcel. "Placed" names PART ONE below: a residency
  EVIDENCE test (does the corpus put this person inside the town, as opposed to
  outside it), not a location. Before T-0599 that test's name doubled as this
  pass's filename prefix (`hh_placed_`); a household minted from here on gets a
  plain `hh_<surname>_<given>` id instead, with `source_pass: "placed"` recording
  which test it passed — see `household_id()` / `minted_by()` below.

  PART ONE — PLACEMENT. The corpus must put the person inside the town and nowhere
  outside it. `associated_places` is resolved against the committed dataset:
  `in_town_places()` (shared with T-0376's pass) is the bare town, every committed
  1835 street name, and every committed structure's name and aka, so a street record
  renamed or a building added moves the test with it.
    · any place outside that set REFUSES — 'Green Bay', 'Detroit', 'Cook county',
      'Naper's Settlement'. This is how the corpus names somebody who was somewhere
      else, and it outranks any placement in the town: a man the paper puts in two
      places has not told us where he lived.
    · NO place at all REFUSES. The corpus is silent about where he was, there is no
      trade to anchor him, and a printed name on its own is not evidence of residence.
      37 of the pool are refused here and they are refused honestly rather than swept
      in on the strength of having appeared in a Chicago newspaper.

  PART TWO — CORROBORATION, because a bare 'Chicago' is weak. The gazetteer records
  'Chicago' when the corpus says a person did something AT Chicago, which is a
  different claim from living there — a bride married at Chicago, a Secretary of War
  received at Chicago. So a bare-town placement needs a SECOND witness, and the corpus
  offers exactly three that can be derived:
    (a) a placement at street or structure level — the corpus gives an address inside
        the modelled town, which no visitor passing through acquires;
    (b) print in two or more separate ISSUES — a transient is printed once and is gone;
        the town's own people recur across the run;
    (c) print in the same claim as TWO OR MORE people this reconstruction already
        holds. The register says who those are: its `enrich` action is the finding
        that a person in the papers is a person already in `data/residents/`. A man
        named on a committee beside three committed residents is placed by the company
        the corpus prints him in.
  ONE witness is enough. None is a refusal, and 12 of the pool are refused there.

THE STRUCTURAL REFUSALS — a name that cannot head a household at all. Six are T-0376's
and are kept word for word, because they are the same facts about the same corpus:
`garbled`, `a firm, not a person`, `first evidence after the scene date` (AGENTS.md
rule 3), `no surname the corpus prints`, `a surname and nothing else`, and the two
duplicate guards (`the town already names a <Surname>`, `surname already minted`).
Three more are new, and each was found by reading this pass's own output:

  · `the corpus carries this name as a business, and not among its proprietors` —
    'Eagle Hotel' is in the register's persons and is a BUILDING. The gazetteer's
    business records are the derived test: a name that is a business and is NOT listed
    among that business's own proprietors is the business, not a man. A tradesman
    whose shop the papers advertise under his own name IS among the proprietors, so
    this refuses the hotel without refusing the hatter.
  · `an article and a common noun, not a person` — 'the Baptist meeting house'. A
    grammatical fact about the printed name, not a list.
  · `the name is not printed clear of the transcription's uncertainty marks` — 180
    people, the largest refusal in the pass and the one that came from reading its own
    first output. See `printed_clear()` below: the register's normalized name hides
    damage the corpus records, and a household may not be named after a word the
    source does not contain. It is tested second, immediately after `garbled`, because
    both are facts about whether there is a legible name at all — everything below
    them is a fact about the person.
  · `the corpus prints a trade the residents vocabulary has no word for` — 36 people.
    `compile_register.py`'s TRADE_TO_OCCUPATION is a closed table by design, so a
    printed 'tinsmith', 'provision dealer' or 'house and land agent' arrives here with
    `occupation: null` NOT because the papers are silent about the trade but because
    the vocabulary cannot say it. Those people are documented TRADESPEOPLE and this
    pass will not mint them as trade-less: minting them would lose the trade the
    corpus prints, and the parent's rule is that an occupation is absent rather than
    invented — it does not license absent rather than RECORDED. They are refused here
    and carried by their own ticket, which this run opened.

WHAT THIS FILE WILL NOT DO. It will not invent an occupation, a dwelling, a division,
a sex or a family; the minted person's occupation reads `none_recorded`, the
residents vocabulary's own word for an absent record, because the corpus gives none. The PERSON is `attested` — the papers print the name. Everything
the household says around them is written as unattested, because it is.

A LIMIT, STATED RATHER THAN PAPERED OVER. The duplicate guards compare surnames
EXACTLY, so 'Blanshard' and 'Blanchard', or 'Eldredge' and 'Eldridge', pass each other
untouched and may be one man under two printed spellings. A fuzzy surname match was
considered and rejected for the reason `compile_register.py` gives for refusing a
fuzzy trade match: it would silently refuse a real family on a spelling that happened
to collide, and a wrongly refused resident is invisible where a wrongly accepted one
is at least a record somebody can read. `data/research/newspapers/identity.json` is
where a decided identity belongs.

THE POOL READS `enrich` BACK, for the reason T-0376's pass does: the register is
compiled FROM the committed town, so the moment this pass mints a man the compiler
stops calling him `new_resident`. An `enrich` whose target is one of THIS pass's own
person ids is read back in as this pass's previous answer.
