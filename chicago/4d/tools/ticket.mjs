/**
 * The ticket queue's one tool: create, claim, close, block, list, board, check.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-17 the owner reported that his own requests were
 * untraceable — "i asked for a whole list of items … it's hard to find that
 * list anywhere in your files" — while the loop researched what it preferred.
 * The operational state ("what next, what's in flight, what's blocked on whom")
 * lived inside an 11,407-line ROADMAP.md and a 6,838-line STATUS.md, which no
 * owner can reorder and no agent can hold in context. Tickets pull the STATE
 * out; the prose stays where it is, as archive.
 *
 * DESIGN RULES, each bought by a documented failure in this repo:
 *  - One file per ticket. Two branches that edit one shared list corrupt it —
 *    the changelog's union-merge history is seven repairs long.
 *  - State lives ONLY in front matter. No state directories: a file's location
 *    and its `state:` field would be two copies of one fact, and this project's
 *    recurring fault is exactly two copies of one fact disagreeing.
 *  - BOARD.md and tickets.json are GENERATED, and since T-0937 they are also
 *    UNTRACKED (.gitignore). `check` and `board` WRITE them rather than refusing a
 *    stale one: a build product that no commit carries cannot be stale, and it
 *    cannot conflict either, which is the whole point — a run's first act is
 *    `claim`, so these three files were rewritten by every branch before it had
 *    done any work, and GitHub's merge runs no driver to reconcile them (T-0857).
 *  - IDs are assigned here, not guessed by authors — two branches that each
 *    guess "top + 1" both get it wrong (the v93/v98 collisions). `nextIdNum`
 *    counts merged tickets AND every branch still in flight on the remote, over
 *    ALL origin refs — narrowing that scan to `steward/*` is what let T-0672 be
 *    minted twice on 2026-09-04, from a `claude/*` branch it could not see. Two
 *    branches created in the same instant can still collide; `check` catches it
 *    at merge and `restamp` is the remedy.
 *  - QUEUE.md order belongs to the owner. This tool APPENDS on `new`, REMOVES
 *    on `done`/`block`/`withdraw`, and never reorders. `check` asserts the
 *    queue is exactly the workable-open set, so it cannot silently drift from
 *    the tickets, but the ORDER of its lines is never touched by machinery.
 *
 * The front-matter parser is deliberately not YAML: flat `key: value` lines
 * between two `---` fences, values read as string | null | true | false. What
 * tickets/README.md documents is exactly what parses; nothing else does.

 * THE PUBLISHED MIRROR OF tickets.json — T-0154, and it is here because the two

 * states them.
 *
 *   1. do the work, run `tools/publish.sh` — "PUBLISH IN THE SAME COMMIT";
 *   2. push, open the PR — the PR NUMBER does not exist until this moment;
 *   3. `ticket.mjs done T-NNNN --pr N` — "close it in the merging PR";
 *   4. …which rewrites tickets.json, and `check_published.mjs` compares that file
 *      to this mirror byte for byte. The gate is now red, on every close.
 *
 * Step 3 needs a number that only step 2 can produce, so no ordering of the
 * documented steps ends green. What actually happened instead was a REMEMBERED
 * extra `publish.sh` after the close — the unwritten step that goes wrong at 3am,
 * and did on T-0153/PR #318.
 *
 * So the writer of the file maintains its mirror. Deliberately narrow:
 *  - it copies when this tool actually rewrote tickets.json, OR when the mirror is
 *    ABSENT. Not on every invocation: a mirror that somebody else made stale must
 *    still fail the gate — the acceptance clause says so in as many words — and a
 *    blanket refresh would quietly launder exactly that. The absent case is T-0937
 *    and it does not weaken anything, because an absent file is not a stale one:
 *    both this file and its mirror are untracked now, so a fresh clone starts with
 *    NEITHER, and "only on a rewrite" would leave the mirror missing on any clone
 *    that happened to rebuild the source first.
 *  - it never creates the mirror directory. An unpublished checkout stays
 *    unpublished; `publish.sh` is what decides the mirror exists.
 *  - `check` pins the copy line in publish.sh, below, so the destination cannot
 *    drift into two disagreeing copies of one fact.

 * three-hour mark its branch drops out of the hot list and `inflight` files it under
 * "finished tickets, or branches older than a run". Both halves of that heading are
 * false about it — it is neither finished nor litter — and it drops out at exactly
 * the moment duplicating it is most expensive. Cohort 14 (T-0509) was read twice on
 * 2026-09-05 by two runs that could not see each other; the two ledgers disagreed on
 * 36 of the 76 people and T-0816 had to adjudicate every one of them.
 *
 * So age is no longer the only witness. TWO others answer together, and it takes
 * both — the first draft of this took only the ticket file and was too loud to use:
 *
 *   - the ticket FILE says `claimed` or `review`. Necessary, not sufficient. T-0987
 *     is worked one stretch per run and is `claimed` on `dev` permanently by design,
 *     so the file alone reported all SEVEN of its long-merged branches as in flight.
 *   - a CLAIM LOCK for that ticket stands on the remote. `claim/t-nnnn` is taken in
 *     the same breath as the claim and released by `ticket.mjs done`, so it is alive
 *     for exactly as long as the run is — however many hours that run spends reading.
 *     It costs nothing to ask: `remoteBranches` already lists every head, this one
 *     included, in the one `ls-remote` this command was already making.
 *
 * `held` rather than `live`, and the distinction is the honest part. T-0802's blind
 * spot runs the other way: a run that dies between its merge and `ticket.mjs done`
 * leaves the ticket `claimed` behind a genuinely cold branch — T-0429 sat that way
 * for five days and cost a 116-file rebuild. If an old claim simply became `live`
 * this command would hide that one forever. `held` reports the branch as in flight,
 * prints its age, and says in one line that a claim outliving a run is either a long
 * read or a dead one and the PR list decides which. `cold` keeps exactly the meaning
 * it always had.
 *
 * Offline, and deliberately: `landed` is where the PR question is asked, and these

 * lock went stale at three hours, a second run stole it, and rebuilt the same 71-file

 * between the merge and `ticket.mjs done` stays `claimed` with a COLD branch — which
 * reads as litter, not as done, and `claimed` with no PR is exactly the shape of
 * available work.
 *
 * T-0429 is the instance and it is costed. Its PR #597 merged to `dev` on
 * 2026-09-01T00:40:50Z; the run died before closing the ticket; five days later it was
 * still the topmost queue line carrying no PR, and `steward/t-0429-south-water-lasalle`
 * rebuilt the whole block — 116 files, 5,827 insertions, baked — on records that
 * already existed on `dev` under the same ids. tickets/README.md costs a recurrence at
 * about seventy minutes of loop time.
 *
 * The question that settles it is cheap and it is the same evidence a person uses:
 * for each ticket not in a terminal state, does a MERGED pull request name its id?
 *
 * THREE RULES, AND EACH IS A REFUSAL TO OVERREACH.
 *
 *  1. IT REPORTS, IT NEVER FAILS. The id in a PR title is a convention, not a
 *     contract. A gate that hard-fails on a naming convention blocks a run that did
 *     nothing wrong, so `landed` exits 0 with findings and check.sh does not call the
 *     network at all — what the gate runs is the offline self-test.
 *  2. EVIDENCE ONE WAY ONLY. A merged PR naming T-NNNN is strong evidence the work
 *     landed. Its ABSENCE proves nothing — a PR whose title omits its id is invisible
 *     here — so silence is never reported as a clean bill of health.
 *  3. NO NETWORK DEGRADES TO SILENCE, NEVER TO A FALSE ACCUSATION. `remoteBranches`
 *     is the precedent: these callers stand between a run and its work, and a blip
 *     must not be able to stop one, nor to invent a finding out of an empty answer.

/* ------------------------------------------------------- the claim lock */

/**
 * THE CLAIM IS A LOCK ON THE REMOTE, AND IT IS TAKEN AT CLAIM TIME.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (owner, 2026-09-11, asking "can you prevent duplicate claiming
 * going forward?" after six open PRs turned out to be six runs working tickets
 * another run had already finished — T-0990, T-1008, T-0867/T-0868, T-1026,
 * T-0424, T-1011, every one of them closed on `dev` by somebody else).
 *
 * `claim` writes `state: claimed` into a ticket FILE, and that file reaches `dev`
 * only when the PR merges — so until then every other run reads the ticket as
 * `open`. `remoteBranchesFor` above is the mitigation and it is the right idea,
 * but it can only see a branch that has been PUSHED, and a run does not push for
 * about an hour after it claims. Measured on the two duplicates that cost most:
 *
 *   T-1026  winner claimed 03:46, loser claimed 04:10 — 24 minutes later — and
 *           the winner's branch was not pushed until 05:27. A 1h41m window with
 *           nothing on the remote to see.
 *   T-1008  the LOSER claimed FIRST, at 18:05. The run that won claimed at 19:08,
 *           read `dev`, and saw `open`, because the first claim was still local.
 *           Claiming earlier is no protection at all when claims are invisible.
 *
 * So a claim now takes a marker ref on the remote BEFORE any work, and the push
 * that takes it is a compare-and-swap the SERVER decides: `--force-with-lease=
 * <ref>:` with an empty expected value means "only if this ref does not exist".
 * Two runs claiming in the same second cannot both win. Verified against a real
 * remote before this was written, all four cases — create, reject, steal, and a
 * steal with the wrong expected sha.
 *
 * IT IS STILL NEVER A FALSE STOP, which is the property the branch scan already
 * promised. A REJECTION refuses the claim. Anything else — no network, no
 * credentials, no remote, a checkout with no push rights — warns and lets the run
 * through, exactly as a failed `ls-remote` does.
 *
 * A marker older than RUN_HOURS is a run that died, and is STOLEN automatically:
 * the steal leases on the sha the marker actually holds, so two runs racing to
 * steal one dead claim still produce exactly one winner. That is why a crashed
 * run cannot strand a ticket — the worst it costs is RUN_HOURS.
 *
 * The marker is a branch (`claim/t-1026`) rather than a ref under some private
 * namespace, for two reasons: GitHub accepts pushes to `refs/heads/*` without
 * argument, and `branchCarries` already matches it, so `inflight` and the rival
 * scan see claims for free. It is a PARENTLESS, EMPTY-TREE commit — it carries no
 * code, cannot be merged into anything by accident, and its commit date is the
 * honest age of the claim. The janitor sweeps `steward/*`, never `claim/*`.

   * — #1387, #1389, #1392 — each of them listing a ticket that had finished on `dev`
   * while the branch was open. It is the commonest red the lap leaves behind, and it
   * is entirely mechanical: a branch's QUEUE.md is a snapshot, `dev` closes tickets
   * under it, and the two disagree until somebody deletes a line by hand.
   *
   * It is not untidiness. A done ticket at the top of the queue is the exact shape of
   * available work, and it is how T-0429 came to be rebuilt across 116 files.
   *
   * THE RULE IS THE GATE'S OWN, not a second opinion: `check` refuses a queue line
   * whose ticket is not open/claimed/review, so that is what this removes. It can
   * only DELETE a line, never add or reorder one, which is what makes it safe for an
   * automaton to run — the owner's ranking is untouched and a line that should stay
   * cannot be moved by it. `--dry-run` prints without writing.

   * a branch was open, LOST by the merge. QUEUE.md is in pr-lap.sh's `GENERATED` set,
   * so a conflict there is cleared by taking a side and letting a tool rewrite the
   * file — and for this file the tool is `board`, which regenerates BOARD.md from the
   * queue and can only ever preserve what the side it took already said. Take the
   * branch's side and every line `dev` added is gone.
   *
   * It is not hypothetical and it is not rare. Measured 2026-09-17 on the two PRs the
   * lap had just pushed: #1400 was missing 28 of dev's queue lines and #1392 was
   * missing 27, both red on the single gate step `ticket queue`, one of 439 — and
   * `prune` ran on both, correctly, and could do nothing. Every line was one of the 27
   * reconstruction tickets dev took in #1402 plus T-1177's retitle.
   *
   * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO IS INVENT AN ORDER. The queue is the OWNER's ordering; that is
   * why `prune` only deletes and why `new` refuses to guess a position without
   * `--after`. So this does not append and it does not sort: it takes the base's queue
   * whole, then walks the branch's queue and puts back each line the base does not
   * carry AFTER THE SAME LINE IT FOLLOWED ON THE BRANCH. A line whose predecessor is
   * not in the base's queue either — the only case with no answer — goes to the foot,
   * which is where `new` puts a line it cannot place, and the report says so.
