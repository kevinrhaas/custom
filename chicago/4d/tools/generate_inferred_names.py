WHY THIS EXISTS, given that the records argued the opposite until now.

Every reconstructed person used to carry a designation — "A baker (inferred
resident, unnamed)" — and the note explained the choice: an invented surname
would make the record indistinguishable at a glance from the documented layer
beside it. That reasoning is sound about the DATA and wrong about the TOWN. A
place where a third of the households are called "an inferred cooper's
household" does not read as a reconstruction with honest gaps; it reads as a
spreadsheet. The owner asked for names, and the record says loudly enough which
layer it belongs to that a name cannot smuggle anything past a reader: the chip
says reconstructed, the note says HYPOTHESISED AND NOT A PERSON, and now a
`name_basis` block says the name itself was invented and what pool it came from.

WHAT KEEPS IT HONEST.

  1. The pools are bounded by evidence this project already holds. They are
     seeded from the 76 ATTESTED residents in data/residents/ — real people,
     named from cited sources — so an invented cooper is named the way this
     town's real coopers were named. See data/reconstruction/
     1835_invented_name_pools.json for the seeds and their citations.

  2. Assignment is DETERMINISTIC, from a hash of the person's id. Re-running
     produces the same town, `--check` proves the committed data is what this
     script derives, and nobody has to wonder whether a name drifted.

  3. The grade never moves. A person graded `reconstructed` keeps that grade,
     and `name_basis.confidence` is `reconstructed` too. validate.py refuses an
     invented name that claims anything better — which is the rule that stops
     this from becoming a way to launder inventions into the documented layer.

  4. Where the trade-to-community weighting is itself a guess, the note says so.
     Boatmen draw French colonial on evidence; labourers draw evenly BECAUSE the
     Irish labouring Chicago of popular memory arrives with the canal contracts
     of 1836, after this scene, and weighting them Irish would be importing a
     later decade into this one.

    # untidy: a shared surname reads as kinship, and this layer claims no
    # relationship whatever between its households. So the community is chosen
    # per person (pass one), and then each community's names are allocated in a
    # stable hash order (pass two) under a rule that spreads them as evenly as
    # the pool allows and repeats only when a pool genuinely runs out.

    # WHAT PASS TWO USED TO DO, AND WHY IT CHANGED (ROADMAP K20). It dealt each
    # bucket round its pool BY INDEX — person i took given[i % n]. That spreads
    # perfectly and is stable across re-runs, which is what this file's own
    # docstring promised and what `--check` proved. What nobody had measured is
    # what it does when the town GROWS: an index is a function of how many people
    # sort ahead of you, so one insertion shifts everybody behind it by one and
    # renames them all. Measured with tools/measure_name_churn.py before the
    # change: a single synthetic household renamed up to 73 of the 113
    # reconstructed residents, 64.6 % of the layer, and never fewer than one.

    # No name that came out of that was wrong — every name here is invented and
    # graded `reconstructed`, so all readings are equally honest. It was a REVIEW
    # defect: a block parcel adding four households shipped a diff in which its
    # four real additions could not be found, and a name that drifted because
    # something was actually wrong would have been invisible inside the noise.
    # Two parcels measured it in passing (T-A2h: 25 of 94; T-A5: 17 of 33) and
