"""Printed pages 47-50 of Fergus 1839: the Fort Dearborn Addition sale, and the
population table (T-0666).

`read_fergus_1839.py` read the alphabetical directory (printed 5-36) and the churches
and hotels (printed 37); `read_fergus_1839_election.py` read the charter election of
2 May 1837 (printed 40-46). These are the last four pages of the appendices, and they
are two different objects on the same sheets:

  printed 47-49 (leaves 59-61)  LOTS SOLD IN FT. DEARBORN ADDITION TO THE TOWN OF
                                CHICAGO, from the 10th to the 24th June, 1839 — the
                                Beaubien, or Reservation, lands. Block, lot, bidder
                                and amount, in four columns twice over per page.
  printed 50   (leaf 62)        POPULATION OF CHICAGO — the volume's own year-by-year
                                table, 1835 to 1876, plus two projections.

  tools/read_fergus_1839_lots.py --map      RE-DERIVE the row map from the scan (NETWORK)
  tools/read_fergus_1839_lots.py --build    write the two claims files
  tools/read_fergus_1839_lots.py --check    rebuild in memory and diff (the gate)
  tools/read_fergus_1839_lots.py --report    the reading counted, and what it could not read
  tools/read_fergus_1839_lots.py --self-test  the three judging rules, fired against breakage

WHY THERE IS A ROW MAP. Both objects are set in columns, and archive.org's OCR reads a
columned page in the order the scanner met the ink, not the order the printer set it.
The flat text of leaf 60 runs the whole left column, then the right column's numbers,
then the right column's names — so a bidder read off the committed text lands beside
somebody else's lot, and the population table's flat text puts 1863 under 1849. The
parent ticket said so and said not to read it off the flat text.

The fix is the one thing the flat text threw away: the word COORDINATES the OCR
carries. `--map` fetches `fergusdirectoryo00ferg_djvu.xml`, splits each page at its
gutter, groups words into printed ROWS by their vertical centre and into CELLS by the
column bands written out below, and commits what it found as
`data/research/directories/fergus_1839_lots_rowmap.json` — for every cell, the exact
[line, from, to] spans of the committed page text it is made of. That is the same
standing as the committed page text itself: derived from the scan by a re-runnable
rule, over the network, and therefore not in `check.sh`. What IS in `check.sh` is
`--check`, which rebuilds the claims offline out of the committed text plus the map,
and `research_domains.py --check`, which rebuilds every quote out of the committed
text through those same spans — so a span that points at the wrong ink fails the gate.

THE COLUMN BANDS ARE WRITTEN OUT, NOT SNIFFED. Six half-pages, six lines of table.
The three sheets are set at three different offsets across the page and a rule that
found the columns for one found the running head for another; T-0664 wrote its line
map out by eye for the same reason, and this is that map one step less by eye.

WHAT DATE THIS IS. The sale ran 10-24 June 1839, so every lot claim carries
`describes_date: "1839-06"` and NOT 1835. These are the Fort Dearborn reservation
lands, which in 1835 were the garrison's and were not lots at all: the ground is south
and east of the river mouth and the plat is four years after the scene date. A bidder
here is a name that MAY corroborate a man in the town and never mints one, and nothing
in this file mints or regrades anybody. The population table's rows each carry the
year the FIGURE describes, which for the first row is 1835.

THE COMPILER'S WARNING BINDS THESE PAGES TOO. Printed page 3: the volume is Fergus's
1876 completion, out of Old Settlers' recollections, of a list he set up from memory
in 1839. The sale list reads like a clerk's abstract and may well be one, but this
reading cannot show that it is, so it is graded as everything else in the volume is.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO READ. A great many of the numerals in this table are destroyed in
the scan — lot 33 prints as `'l ">` over two lines, $303 as `3°3` and `jjj`, $511 as
`51 1`, and printed page 49's left-hand lot column collapses after two lines into a
smear of rotated type (`<J\\Ui`, `00^1`, `In)`). Every such cell is committed with its value NULL and
its ink kept verbatim in `as_printed`, never guessed from the run it sits in. The
sequence would usually give it away, and a number recovered from its neighbours is an
inference wearing a reading's clothes.

WHERE THEY ARE READ INSTEAD (T-0679). The page images are the same scan the OCR is of,
at the same 2238 x 3640 the row map's coordinates are written in, so every cell the row
map places can be cropped off the image and read by eye. That reading is committed as
`data/research/directories/fergus_1839_lots_corrections.json` — the ONE hand-authored
file in this pass — and `--build` applies it. Two rules keep it from becoming a place to
put guesses:

  * EVERY ENTRY ASSERTS THE INK IT CORRECTS. A correction names the `as_printed` string
    the generated cell carries today, and a mismatch is a hard failure rather than a
    silent write. A re-map that moves a row cannot slide somebody else's lot number
    under a correction.
  * A CORRECTED ROW IS REGRADED `scan_verified`, and since T-0779 that grade covers the
    WHOLE row — block, lot, amount, whether the lot was withheld, AND the bidder. T-0679
    deliberately left the bidder column alone and said so; T-0779 read all six half-page
    bidder columns off the same images and corrected the thirteen names the scan mangled
    and the three ditto marks it mapped no ink to. A row that carries no correction is
    still `transcription_mediated`, which is what its numerals are.

What the image settles is the ink, not the sequence: where the page prints nothing —
a braced run of reserved lots sharing one price, the blank line between two blocks —
the correction fills nothing and says why.

AND THE ROW THE SCAN HAS NO INK FOR AT ALL (T-0778). A correction reaches a cell the row
map gathered; it cannot mint a row, and printed page 47 needs one. That half ends on
block 5, whose lots 1 to 5 are braced against a single *Reserved.*, and the OCR mapped
words to four of the five — so the reading held 267 rows where the page prints 268 and
block 5 jumped from lot 4 to lot 6. `--map` cannot gather ink that is not in the scan, so
the corrections file gains an `added_rows` section instead, and `added_row()` below states
the three assertions that keep it from becoming a place to put rows that were never
printed. The added row is numbered AFTER the last mapped row rather than in its printed
position, because fourteen household cards and four sidecars cite `f1839_lot` ids and a
positional insert would move every one of them after this page onto ink it was not
written against.

    makes it safe is the ink it was written against. An added row has no ink and therefore
    no cell: printed page 47's right half ends on block 5, whose lots 1 to 5 are braced
    against a single *Reserved.*, and the scan carries words for four of the five. A layer

      1. THE ROW IT FOLLOWS still reads the block and lot it was written against. A re-map
         that moves the page cannot slide this row in behind somebody else.
      2. THE ROW MAP STILL GATHERS NOTHING in the y band this row occupies. If a later
         --map DOES find the ink — a better scan, a wider window — the addition stops being
         an addition and this raises instead of shipping block 5's lot 5 twice.
      3. THE INK THAT GOVERNS THE ROW is quoted verbatim out of the committed page text.
         The lot NUMERAL is not in the scan and the claim says so — `as_printed` is null on
         every one of its four cells — but the brace's own *Reserved.* is, and that word is
         what the page prints against this lot. The claim quotes it, so the verbatim gate
         in research_domains.py rebuilds this row's quote like every other row's.

    THE ID IS THE NEXT FREE ONE, NOT A POSITIONAL ONE. `f1839_lot%04d` is assigned by
    position, and fourteen household cards and four sidecars cite those ids. Inserting a
    row in the middle of printed page 47 with a positional id would move every id after it
    onto ink it was not written against — silently, on a card a visitor opens. So the row
