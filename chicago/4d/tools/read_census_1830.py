"""The 1830 federal schedule that contained Chicago, read off the film.

WHAT WAS READ, AND WHY IT IS NOT CALLED "THE CHICAGO CENSUS". Chicago was enumerated
in 1830 inside the district the enumerator headed "Peoria & Putnam Counties &
Territory attached" — the whole of northern Illinois hung off two organised counties,
because Cook County did not exist until January 1831. The schedule never writes the
word Chicago. So the object here is the DISTRICT, and the Chicago settlement is a run
of households inside it. Anything that says otherwise is reading a later index back
into the page.

THE DEPOSIT. NARA microfilm M19, Illinois, reel 24, republished by the Internet
Archive as item `populationsc18300024unit` (Greene, Morgan, Sangamon, Calhoun, Pike,
Fulton, Knox, Henry, Adams, Hancock, Warren, Mercer, Peoria, Putnam and Jo Daviess
counties). The item carries NO text layer — its own OCR metadata says "language not
currently OCRable" — so nothing here was extracted; the leaves were fetched as
images, cropped and read by eye. Leaves n580 and n582 are the two read for T-0498.
`data/research/census_1830/text/peoria_putnam_1830_leaves_580_582.txt` is that
reading, committed, and every record below stands on one of its lines.

THE READING GRADE is `scan_verified` for every row: the page image itself was read,
not somebody's transcription of it. That is the stronger of the two grades and it is
claimed honestly — but see CONFIDENCE, which is a separate axis and is where the
hand's ambiguity is recorded.

CONFIDENCE. `documented` where the hand is unambiguous. `inferred` where letters are
genuinely open and the note carries the alternates. Nothing here is `conjectural`,
because a name nobody can read is not written down as a guess — it is written down as
what the ink does, and the alternates go in the note.

NORMALIZED is this project's spelling of the same person. It differs from `as_read`
only where the identification is secure and the reason is stated in NORMALIZE below.
Where it is not secure the normalized form is the reading, uppercased, and the guess
lives in the resident crosswalk as a CANDIDATE where it can be refused.

1830 IS FIVE YEARS EARLY, and this file mints nothing. A head of family on this
schedule stood in the district in the summer of 1830. Whether he was in Chicago on
1 July 1835 is a question for T-0513/T-0514, which have the ladder; the crosswalk
this tool writes is the input to that and not a substitute for it.
