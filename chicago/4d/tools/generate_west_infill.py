"""Generate the anonymous West Division parcel west of Wolf Point.

The authored recipe (`data/reconstruction/1835_phase2_west_wolf_point_approaches.json`)
fixes an aggregate mix and a review layout, not fifty-five recovered buildings. Every
generated instance therefore says, in machine-readable and visitor-facing fields, that
its presence, position and footprint are conjectural.

**THE WHOLE PARCEL IS EMITTED SINCE T-1444, AND THAT TOO IS THE RECIPE'S OWN
INSTRUCTION.** Its `terrain_and_hydrology_gate` used to block any placement whose
centre lay west of local E -300 m until the modelled surfaces reached the extended box,
because a roof west of the ground would stand on nothing and the ground-contact gate
would have no surface to check it against. T-1416 built that ground: the committed
heightfield now spans E -705..1700 m, and the collision surface, the water mask and the
vegetation sampler are all readings of that same field, so the condition the block was
written against is met and the block is retired rather than waived. The 35 held slots
instantiate on their recipe ids and their recipe families, exactly as the hold promised.

**Five of those thirty-five stay held, on a different question entirely.** They stand
inside the drift band of the corporate boundary's extrapolated west leg, so it would be
the extrapolation rather than the 1833 ordinance deciding whether each stood inside the
town limits or outside them. The reconstruction leaves that side unstated by not
building the roof; see `BOUNDARY_HOLDS`. They keep their ids, their families and their
dealt sequence numbers, exactly as the terrain hold kept them.

The hold's one lasting mark is the dealing order. `seq` deals finish, roof condition,
age state and form, and the twenty roofs built under the hold were dealt 1..20 in
recipe order. Releasing the rest does not redeal them: `dealing_order()` keeps those
twenty first and appends the thirty-five behind them, so nothing already committed,
reviewed and baked moves because its neighbours arrived.

Like its two siblings (`generate_inferred_infill.py`, `generate_north_infill.py`) this
re-derives every record byte for byte under `--check`, which is what makes 20 generated
buildings auditable rather than 20 hand-placed ones.

# nothing could check its layout against a street until now. A building in the
# middle of Clinton Street is the one thing everyone can see is wrong, and K7's own
# phase-two note already records seven EXISTING records standing in the road.
#
# Each slot is therefore set back to the nearest position that clears the corridor

# THE FACING CORRECTION IS GONE, AND SO IS THE FAULT IT COVERED (T-1497, 2026-09-21).
# `west_rec_033` was a 20 x 32 ft D5 dwelling — 1.6, past the 1.5 at which
# frame_dwelling_params refuses an eaves-front house on a front narrower than its own
# range — and this module used to swap its two dimensions and turn the bearing a quarter
# circle to get it through the archetype. That correction was the right shape of answer
# to the wrong question: it treated a front-gable rectangle as a fact of the layout and
# the eaves-front archetype as the limitation. The reading at
# docs/RESEARCH/d5_gable_front_1835.md settles it the other way. No source reached
# attests a Chicago dwelling gable-end to a street before 1 July 1835, so D5 is an
# eaves-front family and its row now says so; the rectangle, not the archetype, was
# wrong. The recipe re-authors the slot at 20 x 30 — two feet off the depth, the smaller
# of the two moves the band permits, and the same repair T-1445 made to
# `recon_1835_west_009` at the identical rectangle — and this generator now builds every
# West Division slot from the recipe's own dimensions with nothing turned.

# FIVE SLOTS STAY HELD, AND NOT FOR TERRAIN. The corporate boundary of 7 November 1833
# resolves its west leg on Jefferson Street, whose committed centreline ends far south
# of this parcel: `tools/measure_corporation_limits.py` carries it 1 188.8 m past that
# end to reach Ohio, and an extension that long is uncertain by 22 m of drift. Five of
# the released slots stand inside that band — 6.9 to 22.6 m from the line — so it is the
# EXTRAPOLATION, not the ordinance, that would decide whether each of them stood inside
# the town of Chicago or outside it. The gate says the remedy in as many words: trace the
# street, or leave the structure's side unstated. Tracing Jefferson north to Ohio is not
# this ticket's work, so the side is left unstated in the only way a reconstruction can
# leave it unstated — the roof is not built. They keep their ids, their families and
# their dealt sequence numbers exactly as the terrain hold kept them, so the day the
# centreline is carried they instantiate unchanged. Measured 2026-09-20; T-1490 owns it.
# The slots and their measurements are RECORDED IN THE RECIPE, under
# `terrain_and_hydrology_gate.boundary_hold`, and read from there rather than retyped:
# `tools/reconcile_665.py` has to count the same hold, and two copies of a hold are how
# a schedule and a generator come to disagree about what the parcel still owes.
