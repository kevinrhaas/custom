/**
 * measure_west_of_box.mjs — the west wall of the modelled ground: what stands
 * off it today, and what the wall that replaces it has to clear.
 *
 * T-1415, of T-1193. Its northern sibling `measure_north_of_box.mjs` answers
 * "what does the renderer DO with the committed town outside the box". This one
 * answers the question the west side asks instead, which is a decision and not
 * a consequence: `data/reconstruction/1835_phase2_west_wolf_point_approaches.json`
 * holds 35 of its 55 placements for want of ground, its own
 * `terrain_and_hydrology_gate` names E -700 m as the box it needs, and nothing
 * in this repo had ever derived that number or priced the field that carries it.
 *
 * A ROUND FIGURE IS NOT A DERIVATION. The other three walls of this box each
 * stand on three tests, written out in `terrain_spec.json` § box_derivation:
 *
 *   1. CONTAINS — it clears the westernmost thing the box must hold, and the
 *      clearance is stated in metres. Here that thing is not a placement's
 *      CENTRE but the western edge of its footprint: a roof is contained when
 *      all of it is, and `generate_west_infill.py`'s own validator tests the
 *      whole footprint for exactly that reason.
 *   2. ERROR BAR — it clears that thing's positional uncertainty as well as the
 *      thing. The West Division centres are dealt against a street grid fitted
 *      to the Wright 1834 sheet, so the bar is the georeference's own:
 *      `data/datum.json` records RMS 17.5 m and a MAXIMUM of 32.7 m, and a
 *      single point is owed the maximum rather than the mean.
 *   3. LATTICE — it lands on the existing 2.5 m sampling lattice, so no sample
 *      the field already carries moves. Both the southern extension (T-0464)
 *      and the northern one (T-1123) were careful to keep that property and it
 *      is cheap to keep.
 *
 * Run those three and the wall comes out at E -705 m, not at the recipe's
 * round -700: -700 clears the westernmost held footprint by 28.46 m, which
 * clears the sheet's RMS and stands 4.24 m SHORT of its worst residual. Five
 * metres and two columns of field buy that back. The tool derives it rather
 * than asserting it, so the number moves when a placement moves.
 *
 * IT MOVES NO GROUND. `grid` in `terrain_spec.json` is a mesh input and this
 * ticket does not touch it; `box_derivation` is prose (generators/
 * terrain_inputs.py § PROSE_KEYS, scheme v5) and is where the reasoning goes.
 * The heightfield, the collision surface, the water mask and the bake are
 * T-1416's, and the reading below is what that run has to close.
 *
 *   node tools/measure_west_of_box.mjs             table + verdict
 *   node tools/measure_west_of_box.mjs --json      machine-readable
 *   node tools/measure_west_of_box.mjs --gate      assert against the reading
 *   node tools/measure_west_of_box.mjs --write     rewrite the reading
 *   node tools/measure_west_of_box.mjs --self-test the assertions, fired
 *
 * `--gate` holds `data/terrain/west_of_box_reading.json` against a
 * re-derivation, so the wall's clearances cannot rot while the recipe, the
 * street layer or the box moves underneath them. It asserts AGREEMENT, not that
 * the wall is where anybody wanted it.
