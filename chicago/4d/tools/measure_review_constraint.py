"""What `review_required` actually blocks.

ROADMAP K34. AGENTS.md puts one constraint above the work — *the final removal of
the Potawatomi from Chicago occurred in August 1835, inside this project's first
target year* — and gives it exactly one mechanism:

    `review_required: true` on any record blocks a scene from being marked `released`.

Nothing had ever measured what that sentence covers.

    tools/measure_review_constraint.py           print the census
    tools/measure_review_constraint.py --gate    exit 1 on a divergence
    tools/measure_review_constraint.py --update  rewrite the baseline (deliberate act)

SIX ASSERTIONS, AND FIVE OF THEM ARE ABSOLUTE. There is no ratchet here on purpose:
a ratchet is the right instrument for a fault being paid down, and this is not a fault
being paid down. It is a constraint the project has committed to, so the honest bar is
zero rather than "no worse than yesterday".

1.  **A record that says it carries the flag carries it.** Two sentences are used in
    this dataset and both are declarative: *"It carries review_required so that no
    scene containing it can be marked released"*, and *"review_required is set false …
    but the call is worth a second opinion"*. Each is a claim ABOUT the field, in the
    same file as the field, and nothing read the two together.

    A REGEX OVER PROSE IS THE RIGHT INSTRUMENT HERE AND IS USUALLY THE WRONG ONE.
    R-W4a and the smoke's own `/terrain|water/i` filter were regexes guessing at a
    CATEGORY from prose — they read like a rule until a name changed under them. This
    one matches the sentence that IS the claim being tested. If the sentence is
    reworded, the claim stops being made in a form anything can check, which is a
    thing worth failing over rather than a thing to sniff harder for.

2.  **`touches_removal` implies `review_required`, at every level that carries either.**
    `tools/validate.py` holds the household half. Persons carry the same two fields in
    the schema and nothing had ever asked them.

3.  **The constraint propagates to the buildings.** A household carrying it lives and
    works somewhere, and the scene draws the building rather than the person. This
    holds today at 11 links out of 11 — and held only by coincidence before this gate,
    because nothing required it.

4.  **The release block sees every layer that carries the flag.** Behavioural, against
    the real dataset: `validate_scene` is run with `released` forced true, and the
    blocked set it names must be exactly the union of flagged ids across the layers.
    This is the assertion that fails on the pre-K34 validator, which built that set out
    of `data/structures/` alone while its own household-side message promised that "any
    record touching it blocks a scene from being marked released".

5.  **A flag may be added freely and may not be cleared silently.** `--gate` fails when
    a record in `tools/review_constraint_baseline.json` has lost its flag, and names
    what clearing one is supposed to mean: the consultation AGENTS.md commits to has
    happened. New flags pass, print, and are folded in by `--update`.

6.  **A flagged record says WHY it is flagged** — T-0025, and it is a correction of
    this tool's own K34 write-up as much as a new rule.

    K34 finished by naming three structures that "state no reason at all" —
    `beaubien_barn`, `clybourn_slaughterhouse`, `robert_kinzie_store` — and left the
    question open as K35. **Two of the three had said it all along**, in the records'
    committed bytes at K34's own commit: the barn in its `research_note` (*"REVIEW IS
    FLAGGED for the reason data/structures/jb_beaubien_homestead.json … give"*), the
    slaughterhouse in its `function.note` (*"flagged for review with the rest of this
    record's Indigenous content rather than paraphrased away"*). A fourth record K34
    never named, `council_house`, said it in `function.note` too. The finding was a
    hand-read of one field on a record whose reasoning is spread across several, and
    the ONE real gap in it — `robert_kinzie_store` — sat behind two records that were
    not gaps. That is the argument for reading the whole record here, exactly as
    assertion 1 already does, rather than the field a reader expects it in.

    So the bar is two halves, both inside the record's own prose, wherever in it they
    fall: it must (a) refer to the flag, in one of the phrasings this dataset uses, and
    (b) name the subject AGENTS.md's constraint is about. **Record-level and not
    sentence-level, deliberately** — `cobweb_castle` opens with *"THE RECORD IS FLAGGED
    review_required BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS BUILDING WAS"* and spends the next two
    sentences saying what that was, which is good writing and would fail a
    same-sentence rule.

    K35 called this route "the weakest, because 'says something' is not 'says why'",
    and that is still true and is why the census PRINTS the sentence it matched under
    every flagged id. The gate can hold the shape of the claim; only a reader can
    judge the argument, and this makes the argument the thing a reader is handed.
