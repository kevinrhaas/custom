"""T-1172 — stage `readmissions`: the borderline roster re-admitted under its own read names.

    python3 tools/readmit_borderline_roster.py --build      write the re-admissions
    python3 tools/readmit_borderline_roster.py --check      re-derive them byte-for-byte
    python3 tools/readmit_borderline_roster.py --self-test  the mutations the rules refuse

THE OWNER, 2026-09-16: *"give them a real human name … research that … may have only been
one source not a few so you marked them out, but now is the time to dip back into that and
fill out the population."*

T-1159 built the borderline roster — every name the corpus PRINTED and the research
WITHHELD, each with its evidence limit and the class of re-admission it allows. This tool
spends four of those classes. It overturns no refusal: a refusal was a ruling about
EVIDENCE and it stands. What it adds is a SECOND row of kind `reconstructed_readmission`
that says, at the reconstructed tier, what the town looks like if the name is admitted, and
what would retire it again.

WHERE THE WRITES GO, AND WHY NOT INTO THE CARDS. `data/residents/households/` is derived:
`mint_letter_list_residents.py`, `mint_civic_residents.py` and their siblings re-derive it
drift-zero, and `data/residents/index.json` is derived from THAT directory in turn. A
re-admission is not a mint output and must not pretend to be one, so:

  * the ruling itself lives in `data/reconstruction/1835_readmissions.json`;
  * a re-admitted household that has no card gets one under `data/residents/readmitted/`,
    a directory no mint writer and no index rebuild globs;
  * `tools/compile_scene.py` overlays both onto `sidecars/<scene>/people.json`, which is
    where the People view reads the town.

So a mint re-run is still byte-identical, and nothing here can be mistaken for research.

THE PERSISTENCE MODEL, MEASURED RATHER THAN CHOSEN. Three of this project's crosswalks
count how many of the SAME 1,280-person layer a later Chicago source still names: Fergus
1839 (164), Fergus 1843 (136) and Norris 1844 (112). Their LEVEL is dominated by how much
of the town each volume covers at all, which nobody knows. Their SLOPE is not: a coverage
constant that is roughly the same in all three volumes cancels out of the ratio between
them, and what is left is the rate at which a person the layer names stops being found in
Chicago. A least-squares line through ln(matched) against the years from the scene date
gives that rate directly, and `persistence(L) = exp(-lambda * L)` is what a card whose
evidence stops L years before 1 July 1835 is worth.

It is a reconstruction and it is written down as one (docs/LIBERTIES.md). What bounds it:
the three measured points, the assumption that directory coverage is stable across them,
and the exponential form. What would retire it: a measured Chicago out-migration rate for
the 1830s, or a fourth horizon that bends the line.
