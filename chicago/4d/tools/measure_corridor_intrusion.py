"""How much of this town is drawn standing in its own streets.

ROADMAP K30(a). Every generator in this project asks `plat_corridors.intrusion()` before
it puts a roof anywhere, so no invented building has ever been allowed into a roadway.
Nothing had ever asked the question of the records a PERSON placed. T-A9 measured three of
them by hand, T-A12 added two more, and the entry asked for the distribution rather than
the anecdotes: *"a handful of deep intrusions on one street is a different problem from a
uniform half-metre bias across the grid, and the fix differs accordingly."*

This is the distribution, as a command.

**Two tests, reported separately, because they answer different questions.**

* **lap** — any point of the footprint is inside a platted corridor. This is the drawn
  fault: it is what a visitor standing in the street can see.
* **centroid** — the footprint's centroid is inside one. This is `T-A7`'s test, the one
  that decides whether the lot schedule can see the building at all, and it is a strict
  subset of the lap set.

**A corridor is not the travelled way.** `plat_corridors` says so at length and it governs
here too: L79 records the visible tracks running 5.8-10.5 m inside an 80 ft legal corridor,
so a building 1 m inside a corridor edge is a measurement about the plat and the
georeference, not a building in anybody's way. That is why this tool reports a DEPTH and a
distribution and refuses to name a threshold. **The 2-3.5 m gap in the depths is the one
piece of structure in the data**, and it is reported rather than legislated.

**What it must never do is move a building to make its number smaller.** A position with a
source outranks a corridor this project derived from a module and a traced centreline.

    """K30(b)'s cause — REFUTED 2026-08-22 by `--anchors`. Read that first.

    THIS COMMAND IS NOW A COUNTERFACTUAL LIKE `--recentre`, NOT A DIAGNOSIS. The paragraph
    below is K30(b)'s reasoning, left standing because the command is its evidence and a
    refuted claim is kept, not deleted. What it gets wrong is stated once, here: it reads
    "the body is drawn toward the street from the anchor" as proof that the ANCHOR is on the
    frontage. It is not. `--anchors` measures which face the anchor is, and on all 17 records
    in the deep mode it is the BACK corner — the point is set back by the footprint's own
    depth so that the street-facing FACE lands on the frontage, which is the same convention
    the dataset's machine-checked derivation blocks state. Reflection therefore takes a
    correctly drawn body a full depth BEHIND its own frontage. See ROADMAP K30(d).

    K30(a) refuted the anchor convention by RECENTRING — moving each footprint half its own
    depth. That was the wrong counterfactual for the right suspect. The convention it was
    testing is real and it is universal: 331 of the 333 committed footprints put local
    (0, 0) at the polygon's minimum corner, so every body in this dataset grows NORTH and
    EAST from the point the record was derived to.

    And the hand-placed South Water records were derived to their FRONTAGE — the position
    notes say so in as many words, "the modern intersection centre was read from
    OpenStreetMap and the footprint offset 12.2 m, half an 80 ft platted street". A point
    on the south kerb, with a body that grows north from it, is a building drawn across its
    own frontage and into the roadway by its full depth. That is not a georeference error
    and no coordinate is wrong; the derivation convention and the drawing convention were
    never reconciled with each other.

    So the counterfactual that tests it is a REFLECTION, not a recentring: mirror the
    footprint about the line through its own anchor parallel to the corridor it laps, which
    is the same record with its body on the other side of the frontage it was derived to.

    THIS IS A DIAGNOSIS AND NOT A PROPOSAL, for two reasons that both matter. It changes
    footprint polygons, so it changes every affected mesh and needs a bake this runner
    cannot do; and "the reflection clears the corridor" is evidence about the CAUSE, not
    authority to redraw a documented building. The repair is K30(c)'s, with the bake.

    """K30(d) — WHERE IN ITS OWN BODY DOES THE RECORD'S POINT SIT? The test K30(b) lacked.

    K30(b) read one flag — is the body drawn toward the street from the anchor? — and
    concluded that the anchor stands on the frontage and the body is drawn across it. That
    flag cannot tell the two arrangements apart, because BOTH make it true:

    * **anchor at the KERB.** The point is on the frontage and the body grows across it into
      the roadway by its own full depth. This is the fault K30(b) described.
    * **anchor at the BACK.** The point is set back from the frontage by the footprint's own
      depth, so the body grows FORWARD and its street-facing FACE lands on the frontage.
      This is a correct drawing, and the body is still "toward the street" from the point.

    The two are separated by one measurement nobody had made: how far the anchor stands from
    the corridor centreline, against how far the body's two faces stand from it. If the
    anchor is the NEAR face the point is at the kerb; if it is the FAR face the point is the
    back corner and the face is what was placed.

    It is the far face on every record in the deep mode. The dataset's own derivation model
    says the same thing in words — `sauganash_hotel`'s machine-checked block reads *"the
    depth is in the polygon, so the constraint is on the FACE"* — and `tools/validate.py`
    recomputes five placements from it on every commit.

    So reflecting a body about its own anchor does not put it back on its frontage; it takes
    it a full depth BEHIND the frontage its control was offset to. See ROADMAP K30(d).

    """T-0195 — WHICH WAY WOULD A LAPPING RECORD HAVE TO MOVE, AND WHAT DOES THE MOVE SPEND?

    The table above says how deep each record stands in a roadway. It has never said what
    getting it out would COST, and on a corner that is the whole question. A corner lot has
    two streets. The South Water repair (T-0198, T-0199, and T-0127's method before them)
    re-derived eleven records against this project's own committed centreline for the street
    they FRONT, and translated each one along that street's normal. Three of the eleven
    stand on a corner, and the move that answers the frontage street cannot answer the one
    the building turns onto: they lap the CROSS street's corridor by 0.16-0.21 m.

    So this mode measures the way out, per record, and names what the way out runs along:

    * **escape** — the shortest translation along the lapped corridor's own normal, away
      from it, that takes the footprint clear of that corridor. Bisected against
      `plat_corridors.intrusion()` rather than assumed equal to the depth, because a
      corridor is an offset polyline and its ring is not parallel to a building's wall.
    * **vs front** — that escape bearing read against the record's OWN facade bearing, the
      authored `position.rotation_deg`. `across` means the escape runs into or out of the
      building's front, so the move changes its SETBACK. `along` means the escape runs
      sideways across its front, so the move changes WHERE ALONG THE STREET IT STANDS.
      `oblique` is neither, and on this plat only a record whose facade is not square to
      its own street reads that way.

    A grid tempts a looser test — "is there a nearby street parallel to the escape?" — and
    on an orthogonal plat that test is TRUE FOR EVERY RECORD, because the street crossing
    the one you lap always runs the way you have to move. It says nothing. The facade
    bearing is what distinguishes the two cases, because it is the record's own statement
    about which street it stands on the front of.

    That distinction is the whole of T-0195's refusal. Moving a documented record ACROSS
    its front is re-deriving a setback against a better line, which is what T-0127 did and
    defended: the claim does not move, only the line it was derived against. Moving one
    ALONG its front moves the corner attribution itself — the one part of these three
    placements a source actually argues — to make a derived number smaller, which is the
    thing this file's own note forbids in as many words.
