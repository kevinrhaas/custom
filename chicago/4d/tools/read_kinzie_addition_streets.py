"""Read the thirteen streets of Kinzie's Addition off Wright's 1834 survey.

    tools/read_kinzie_addition_streets.py           print the reading
    tools/read_kinzie_addition_streets.py --write   write data/traces/kinzie_addition_street_grid.json
    tools/read_kinzie_addition_streets.py --check   re-read the sheet and compare with the committed file

WHY A TOOL AND NOT A TABLE OF NUMBERS. A street on a manuscript plat is two ruled
lines with nothing between them, and where those lines fall is a fact about the
raster that anyone can re-measure. Picking them by eye off a crop is a reading
only the picker can defend; projecting the ink of a window onto one axis and
taking the peaks is a reading the next person can re-run and disagree with by a
number. Every corridor edge in the committed file came out of `_rules()` below,
and `--check` re-derives all of them.

THE SHEET is the National Archives / Historic Urban Plans facsimile registered as
`wright_1834_nara_hup` (5050 x 6628 px at 600 dpi), because at that resolution the
Addition's ruled lines separate cleanly; the BPL master this project traces is
4204 x 5166. Readings are carried to local ENU through the NA sheet's OWN affine —
not through the scan-to-scan transform, which would spend 8.5 px of residual to
reach a frame this reading does not need. The two routes were compared while this
was written and differ by under 0.2 m across the whole Addition.

WHAT THE READING IS AND IS NOT. It gives the plat's MODULE — the tier pitch, the
column pitch, the corridor widths, the order and extent of the streets — to a
fraction of a metre, because those are differences measured inside one corner of
one sheet. It does NOT give the Addition's SEATING on modern ground: the sheet's
own fit carries 16.2 m of RMS residual and its drawn grid runs about 1.2 deg off
the bearing the committed town grid takes from modern control over a 1,420 m
baseline. So `data/streets/1835.json` seats the module on the two committed lines
the Addition shares with the town it adjoins — Michigan Street (`michigan_north`)
and Wolcott Street (`wolcott`) — and this file records what that seating cost.
