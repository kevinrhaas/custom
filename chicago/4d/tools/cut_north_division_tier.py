"""Cut the seven Kinzie-to-the-river blocks, and their four-to-a-face lots.

T-1458, the second half of T-1436. `tools/generate_plat_lots.py` cuts a block only
between two committed street lines, and the North Division tier has one: Kinzie bounds
it north and is `attested`, but its south face is the north line of NORTH WATER STREET,
which `data/traces/street_control.json` refuses a corridor because that street's line is
cut from the river bank rather than from a platted rule. So the tier had a width and no
depth, and no block on it could be cut. T-1457 read the sheet DOWN and supplied the
missing figure, per block, as a DEPTH:

    docs/RESEARCH/north_division_tier_depth.md
    data/traces/thompson_north_division_streets.json § north_tier_horizontals_px

This module is the cut that reading paid for. Nothing here re-reads the sheet and
nothing here is typed: every figure comes from `measure_north_division_tier_depth.py`
(the depths, the rows and the alley) or from `data/streets/1835.json` (the seating).

WHAT EACH PART OF THE OUTPUT IS ENTITLED TO CLAIM

* A block's NORTH FACE is committed Kinzie's south kerb — the `attested` centreline
  offset by the `thompson_module_1830` half-width. `inferred`: arithmetic on a committed
  line and the module.
* A block's EAST and WEST faces are the same offset taken on the tier's `attested`
  north-south centrelines. `inferred`, for the same reason. Block 7 alone has no street
  on its west: it ends on the North Branch, and its west face is T-0451's own px-to-
  easting fit applied to the stroke the scan returns there. That one face is
  `conjectural` and says so on itself.
* A block's SOUTH FACE is its north face carried down by the READ depth. This is the
  whole point of T-1457's refusal to publish northings: a depth is a difference taken at
  one easting and survives the sheet's shear, an absolute northing from up there does
  not. So the south face is parallel to committed Kinzie at the read offset, never fitted
  to the sheet's own southern line. `inferred`, with the reading cited per block.
* The two LOT ROWS and the ALLEY between them come from the same reading, per block, and
  they sum to that block's depth by construction. The tier is a WEDGE: the lower row is
  the 180 ft the sheet letters in every block and the upper row absorbs the difference,
  178.6 ft at Franklin to 232.7 at Wolcott. A South Division subdivision — a centred
  alley, two equal rows — would be wrong here by up to 27 ft a row, which is why this
  module exists rather than a `subdivides: True` flag on the other one.
* A LOT LINE is `inferred`, and that is a grade better than the South Division's
  `conjectural` lot lines: those rest on four-to-a-face read in ONE block and carried to
  eighteen, while every lot line on this tier is a VERTICAL STROKE T-0451's column scan
  returned in that block — five to a block, thirty-four across the seven, one of them
  (block 6's middle) swallowed by the watercourse and carried on the module.
* A LOT NUMBER is `inferred`. The sheet letters 4 on the lower row's west lot in every
  block read; the run of the other seven is not lettered here and is taken from the one
  Original Town block whose lot numerals ARE read (block 18, north row 4 3 2 and south
  row 5 6 7 — `docs/RESEARCH/clark_reach_bulge_1834.md` § 8): a row that carries 4 at its
  west end runs 4-3-2-1 west to east, and the other row runs 5-6-7-8 west to east.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not re-grade North Water Street, does not give that
street the corridor the control refuses it, and does not move a committed line. It says
where the BLOCKS stop, which is the only one of the two the plat draws.
