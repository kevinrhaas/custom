"""A resident's trades, professions and offices as DATED PLURAL ROLES (T-1229, of T-1145).

    python3 tools/derive_resident_roles.py             what the cards would carry, read out
    python3 tools/derive_resident_roles.py --write     write roles[] and the 1835 view
    python3 tools/derive_resident_roles.py --check     it re-derives, and nothing has drifted
    python3 tools/derive_resident_roles.py --self-test the rules below, held over fixtures

WHY A SINGULAR FIELD IS THE DEFECT. `persons[].occupation` holds ONE trade and one
confidence, so a man printed as a candle manufacturer in 1833, a brickmaker in 1839 and a
school inspector in the same register can only be one of them on his own card. Daniel
Elston is the fixture the owner named: the card showed `soap_and_candle_maker` and graded
it an attested 1835 occupation, which is two errors in one field — it erased four other
roles, and it dated the surviving one to a year no source cited for it describes.

WHAT THIS TOOL ASSERTS, and it is three sentences.

  1. `roles[]` is CANONICAL. Every role the card's own evidence carries becomes a row
     naming a controlled role, the kind of role it is, the bound its evidence permits,
     how it was dated, its confidence and the sources it rests on. Two roles are two
     rows; a role whose date is unknown stays unknown and is never widened to 1835.

  2. `occupation` is a GENERATED COMPATIBILITY VIEW of the roles that actually cover
     1835-07-01 — the field the renderer, the people index and the scene compiler still
     read. Where two roles cover the day, both stand in `roles[]` and
     `occupation.roles_at_scene_date` names both, so the singular field can no longer
     decide which of a man's two trades the town is told about.

  3. A ROLE THAT DOES NOT REACH 1835 CANNOT FILL THE 1835 FIELD. That is T-0991's
     repair, and it is made here rather than by hand: the six trades
     `tools/audit_scene_window_trades.py` still reports keep their printing as a dated
     pre-scene role, the 1835 field falls to `none_recorded`, and
     `occupation.withdrawn_from_scene_date` carries the audit's own verdict and note so
     the withdrawal states its reason on the card rather than only in a ledger.

THE DATE RULE IS THE AUDIT'S, DELIBERATELY. A role derived from the 1835 block is bounded
by the `describes_date` spans of the sources that block cites, and it "covers" the scene
date on exactly `audit_scene_window_trades.covers_scene` — the span names a year range
containing 1835. That is a bound from the SOURCE and not a claim about the man, which is
why `dated_by` says which of the two a row is and why `precision` can say `source_span`.
Widening it would quietly re-assert what T-0837's write gate refuses; narrowing it would
disagree with the audit this repair is measured by, and a second opinion on that rule is
the one thing a compatibility view must not have.

AND SINCE T-1404, EVERY ROLE SAYS WHETHER THE TRADE HAD PREMISES OF ITS OWN. `premises`
is read off `data/businesses/rulings/premises_rulings.json`, one ruling per occupation of the
closed vocabulary, and it is the half of T-1182's clause 3 that is NOT a business record:
a clerk, a labourer, a teamster or a boatman kept no house of trade, so the answer to
"where did this man work?" is `no_fixed_premises` on the role itself, with the ruling's
basis saying where the work was done and which ticket owes the workplace link. An
`own_premises` role says the trade implies a house, and
tools/complete_inwindow_trades.py raises one for every keeper who holds none. A role
whose printing has not been ruled into the vocabulary (`role: null`) carries `premises:
null`, because a trade nobody has adjudicated is not a trade this can answer for.

WHAT THIS TICKET DOES NOT READ. The newspaper gazetteer's `persons[].occupations[]`, the
1839 directory and civic-register crosswalks and the 1843/1844 identity-master appearances
are T-1254, together with each role's stated place and employer and the migration table.
The people view's dated timeline is T-1255. This tool reads the CARD, and only the card.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# T-1254 (of T-1145): THE EXTERNAL STRUCTURED ROLE EVIDENCE
#
# Everything above reads the CARD. The evidence below is held in the research tree —
# the newspaper gazetteer, the 1839 city register, and the 1843 and 1844 directory
# crosswalks — and each of those files has already done the hard half: it says which
# resident card an entry belongs to, and on what rule. This section carries the ROLE out
# of those records and onto the person, with the date the record permits, the place it
# states and the body or firm it names.
#
# IT IS READ THROUGH THE CARD WHEREVER THE CARD POINTS. The gazetteer is reached by the
# person's own `press_evidence[].record_id`, which is the identity match the resident
# programme made and graded; this tool does not re-match names. The three directory
# crosswalks key their matches by `person_id` directly, which is the same thing said in
# the other direction.
#
# THE DATE RULE, PER SOURCE, and each is the tightest bound the record actually gives:
#
#   gazetteer   The person's mentions are dated ISSUES, so the bound is `first_seen` to
#               `last_seen` and `dated_by` is `stated_date`. The scene date is covered
#               when it falls INSIDE that run — containment, not the year-overlap rule
#               the card's own block uses. That is not a second opinion on the card's
#               rule: the card cites a SOURCE and can be dated no better than the run of
#               that source, while here the record names the days, and a rule may be
#               tightened by better evidence without being contradicted.
#
#   1843/1844   A trade printed in a directory five years after the scene. The bound is
#               the volume's year, `dated_by` is `printing_year`, and `covers_scene_date`
#               is FALSE always. This is the back-projection T-1145 exists to refuse.
#
#   1839        The city register is a retrospective table set in 1876. Its own crosswalk
#               says what a match may carry: a later office is corroboration of CONTINUED
#               RESIDENCE, never an 1835 fact, and only a row whose term covers the scene
#               (the 1834 sheriffs' rows) carries `reaches_scene`. That flag is honoured
#               here, and then only when the volume is one the card's own grade stands
#               on — which is the same rule tools/validate.py applies from the outside.
#
# WHAT IS NOT PARSED. `place` and `employer_or_body` are taken from the STRUCTURED fields
# the research records already carry — the directories' address and place-of-business
# columns, the register's `body`, and the office bodies named in the fold table below.
# The printed occupation lines of 1843 and 1844 also carry firms and addresses inside the
# prose ("clerk, Charles Walker & Co", "(sign of the three hats), hat, cap, and fur
# manufacturer, 10S Lake Street"), and this tool does NOT dig them out with a pattern. A
# fuzzy rule is how every milliner in this corpus once compiled as a grain MILLER
# (T-0376); a prose firm gets `not_stated` and keeps its wording in `as_printed`, where
# the business band (T-1180 onward) can rule on it.
