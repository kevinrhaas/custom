"""A resident's trades, professions and offices as DATED PLURAL ROLES (T-1229, of T-1145).

    python3 tools/derive_resident_roles.py             what the cards would carry, read out
    python3 tools/derive_resident_roles.py --write     write roles[] and the 1835 view
    python3 tools/derive_resident_roles.py --check     it re-derives, and nothing has drifted
    python3 tools/derive_resident_roles.py --self-test the rules below, held over fixtures

WHY A SINGULAR FIELD IS THE DEFECT. `persons[].occupation` holds ONE trade and one
confidence, so a man printed as a candle manufacturer in 1833, a brickmaker in 1839 and a
school inspector in the same register can only be one of them on his own card. Daniel
Elston is the fixture the owner named: the card showed `soap_and_candle_maker` and graded
it an attested 1835 occupation, which is two errors in one field — it erased four other
roles, and it dated the surviving one to a year no source cited for it describes.

WHAT THIS TOOL ASSERTS, and it is three sentences.

  1. `roles[]` is CANONICAL. Every role the card's own evidence carries becomes a row
     naming a controlled role, the kind of role it is, the bound its evidence permits,
     how it was dated, its confidence and the sources it rests on. Two roles are two
     rows; a role whose date is unknown stays unknown and is never widened to 1835.

  2. `occupation` is a GENERATED COMPATIBILITY VIEW of the roles that actually cover
     1835-07-01 — the field the renderer, the people index and the scene compiler still
     read. Where two roles cover the day, both stand in `roles[]` and
     `occupation.roles_at_scene_date` names both, so the singular field can no longer
     decide which of a man's two trades the town is told about.

  3. A ROLE THAT DOES NOT REACH 1835 CANNOT FILL THE 1835 FIELD. That is T-0991's
     repair, and it is made here rather than by hand: the six trades
     `tools/audit_scene_window_trades.py` still reports keep their printing as a dated
     pre-scene role, the 1835 field falls to `none_recorded`, and
     `occupation.withdrawn_from_scene_date` carries the audit's own verdict and note so
     the withdrawal states its reason on the card rather than only in a ledger.

THE DATE RULE IS THE AUDIT'S, DELIBERATELY. A role derived from the 1835 block is bounded
by the `describes_date` spans of the sources that block cites, and it "covers" the scene
date on exactly `audit_scene_window_trades.covers_scene` — the span names a year range
containing 1835. That is a bound from the SOURCE and not a claim about the man, which is
why `dated_by` says which of the two a row is and why `precision` can say `source_span`.
Widening it would quietly re-assert what T-0837's write gate refuses; narrowing it would
disagree with the audit this repair is measured by, and a second opinion on that rule is
the one thing a compatibility view must not have.

WHAT THIS TICKET DOES NOT READ. The newspaper gazetteer's `persons[].occupations[]`, the
1839 directory and civic-register crosswalks and the 1843/1844 identity-master appearances
are T-1243, together with each role's stated place and employer and the migration table.
The people view's dated timeline is T-1244. This tool reads the CARD, and only the card.
