"""THE 668-ROOF PROGRAMME, RE-DERIVED AGAINST THE ORDER BOOK. T-1196.

    tools/reprogramme_roofs_1835.py --build       re-derive, write the record and the report
    tools/reprogramme_roofs_1835.py --check       re-derive and refuse drift
    tools/reprogramme_roofs_1835.py --self-test   the guards, fired on fixtures

WHAT THIS TOOL IS. An ADJUDICATION over committed derived files, exactly as the
order book and the lodging model are. It reads no page of any source, opens no
network, names nobody, ages nobody, and raises no roof. It asks one question of
each of the ten groups in the building inventory's district/group matrix -- does
the population, occupation and lodging model want a different number of roofs
here than the owner's 2026 specification scheduled? -- and records the answer
with the arithmetic that reached it.

WHY THE PROGRAMME NEEDED ASKING. The 668-roof schedule is a production decision
taken before the population layer existed. The order book (T-1166) now says what
the reconstructed town needs, and it carries five `programme_deltas` rows stamped
`owning_ticket: T-1196` precisely so this comparison would be made deliberately
rather than discovered halfway through a district.

WHAT A DELTA IS NOT. Three of those five rows are not disagreements about roofs
at all, and the largest of them is the most misleading:

  * `households_against_dwellings` (delta 308) compares HOUSEHOLDS against
    DWELLINGS. Satisfying it by adding 308 roofs would build a town of one family
    per roof -- which is the exact error the town model was written to refuse
    ("a roof programme that seats one family per roof undercounts the town"). The
    resolution is an OCCUPANCY RATE, and this tool states it: the programme's
    dwelling roofs hold the order book's households at a rate the November census
    itself brackets. Nothing is built.

  * `institutional_and_public` was a UNIT MISMATCH, corrected by T-1439. The town
    model's high end is 19 because it reads "9 institutional or public roofs
    outside the fort and 10 principal roofs inside it" -- and the programme
    schedules those ten under `fort_principal`, not under `institutional_public`.
    9 + 10 = 19. The programme and the model already agreed; only the comparison
    was wrong, and the order book now sums both groups on its programme side.

  * `boarding_houses` (delta 0) is CIRCULAR. `model_town_1835.build_lodging`
    takes the figure straight off `district_group_matrix`, so the model agreeing
    with the programme here is the programme agreeing with itself. A tautology is
    not corroboration and this record says so rather than banking it.

  * `inns_and_taverns` (delta 6) compares a ROOF COUNT against a NOTICE COUNT.
    The town's structure layer holds exactly as many standing public houses as
    the programme schedules; the register's larger figure counts advertisements,
    several of which repeat one house, and no committed file folds them. Folding
    them is an identity ruling and this tool refuses to make one -- the delta is
    owed out, not acted on.

THE ONE THING THIS TOOL OWNS AND WRITES. The family-archetype crosswalk's COUNT
fields -- `target_roofs`, `remaining_roofs`, `priority_rank`, `priority_band` and
`roof_totals` -- are derived from the inventory's `family_targets` and the
crosswalk's own `priority_rule`, and its own `count_basis` note says as much. They
had drifted: four families (C2, W4, A2, A5) still carried the pre-T-0283/T-1036
targets, so the crosswalk summed to 662 against the inventory's 668, and nine
families carried a `priority_rank` one place out because T-0032 moved I3 from six
roofs to three without re-ranking. `--build` re-derives them. Everything else in
that file is authored -- archetypes, geometry bands, evidence and assumption notes
-- and is never touched here.

--check NEVER WRITES. A check that repairs the file it is checking (T-0856,
T-1341) reports a pass it manufactured; this one re-derives in memory and fails.
