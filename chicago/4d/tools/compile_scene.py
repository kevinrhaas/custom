The renderer reads these, never the raw dataset. That is deliberate: the sidecar
is a flattened, resolved view of one structure at one date, with its citations
already joined in — so the walkthrough and the archival record cannot drift apart,
and the renderer never has to reimplement the phase-resolution rule.

"Cannot drift apart" was a statement about the design and not a check on it until
`--check` existed: the derived files are committed so the site needs no build step,
and a record edited without a recompile shipped a walkthrough quoting the previous
dataset. `tools/check.sh` re-derives them on every commit for the same reason it
re-derives the liberties — drift is a gate failure, not a discovery.

    """Join source ids to the citation the visitor reads. One shape, one place:
    the popup and the exclusions list quote the same record the same way.

    `tier_label` travels with the number because the number on its own says
    nothing. The card has printed "tier 4" since it was written, next to a
    citation, at a visitor who has no table to look it up in — and the whole
    argument of this panel is that a person can judge the evidence for
    themselves. The words come out of `data/source.schema.json` through
    `tools/tiers.py`, the same ladder `check_evidence_ladder` enforces, so the
    rung a value is held to and the rung a visitor is shown cannot come apart.

    And the rung's REASON travels with it, which it did not. A rung is a
    judgement about a document, and on ten of these records the document is not
    the page: `chicagology_lastwardance` is rung 2 because it reprints the
    *Chicago Tribune* of 14 August 1910 printing John Dean Caton's own
    recollection, and a visitor following that citation arrived at a modern
    blog stamped "tier 2 · near-primary recollection" with nothing on the card
    saying why. That is the ladder made to look like an over-grade by the one
    field that would have explained it. `transcribes` and its opposite number
    `carries_no_document` are the reading that fixed the rung, and they are on
    the line now.

    So are the source's own stated limits. `hathaway_1834` says in its record
    that it does NOT supply building footprints — a claim that reached this
    project's brief before anyone opened the scan, and the correction stayed in
    the repository. A source shown without its limits is the one thing this
    panel is not for.

    The four new fields are omitted when a record does not carry them, rather
    than emitted empty: a source with no stated limit should render nothing on
    the card, not an empty heading, and thirteen of twenty-nine records carry
    them. The four that every citation has kept their unconditional shape, so a
    renderer reading `c.tier` still reads a key that is always there.

    `data/residents/index.json` is a manifest of HOUSEHOLDS: it summarises a
    record for the household browser and says nothing about the people in it
    beyond a grade tally. A directory is the other axis — a visitor looks for a
    surname, a trade, a division, a year — and every one of those figures lives
    on the person or on the household record around them, which the browser
    only fetches when a row is opened. Fetching 1,380 files to build a search
    index in the browser is not a design; compiling the flat view here, beside
    every other join this project does, is.

    THE ROW IS A POINTER, NOT A COPY OF THE RECORD. It carries what a list needs
    to sort, filter and label — name, surname, household, grade, trade, division,
    the arrival bound and its precision, the flags that say how the person is
    known, which building they lived or worked at — and the household `file`, so
    the card fetches the record itself and renders it with the same code the
    household browser uses. The notes, the appearances and the citations stay on
    the record: a figure quoted twice is a figure that drifts, and the census in
    `tools/measure_layer_reads.py` reads the record's own text.

    `occupation` is `null` where the record says `none_recorded` (1,270 of them).
    That is the same fact — the ABSENCE of a record, which the occupation note
    on the card explains — in the shape a filter can test, and the row keeps the
    attribute's confidence beside it so the absence is still graded.

    Street research is authored under ``data/streets`` and flattened into the
    same scene index that already carries structures and verified junctions.
    That keeps raw research out of the browser, joins citations once, and makes
    ``compile_scene --check`` the drift gate for the visible roads too.

    The rendered strip is deliberately NOT the whole platted corridor: an
    80-foot legal right-of-way and the wagon-worn earth inside it are different
    claims.  Both widths travel so the readout can identify the street across
    the corridor while flora is cleared only from the narrower travelled part.

    T-0111 SPLIT THE LINE THE SAME WAY THE WIDTHS WERE ALREADY SPLIT, and the
    reason is a measurement rather than a preference.  ``path_local_enu_m`` is
    the PLATTED line, and it is read by ``generate_plat_lots.py`` — which
    re-derives every block face by offsetting the whole polyline — and by
    ``plat_corridors``, which the corridor-intrusion gate scores against.  So a
    three-metre bend appended to it to carry Dearborn's worn track onto its
    causeway moved platted lot lines the length of the street (PLAT GRID DRIFT)
    and pushed the drawbridge itself into a corridor it had not been in
    (30 laps against a committed 29, the deck newly lapping by 0.66 m).  Both
    were measured on the appended path before this field existed.

    ``drawn_track_local_enu_m`` is the optional second line: the wagon-worn
    wheel line the renderer paints, which the plat, corridor and lot
    derivations never read.  It is bounded here rather than trusted — every
    point stays inside the street's own platted corridor and may run past the
    platted line's ends by at most ``DRAWN_TRACK_OVERHANG_MAX_M`` — so the
    field can reach a bridge abutment and cannot quietly become a second plat.

    had any way to reach it and ninety-six researched Chicagoans were invisible on
    the site — the exact complaint the owner made about work that had "landed".
    A building is the only place a visitor meets a resident, so the household
    travels in the building's own sidecar and the card shows who lived or worked
    there, with each person's accuracy grade shown as plainly as an attribute's
    confidence.

    `basis` is the sentence the inferred-household programme owes the reader: a
    building raised BECAUSE of a hypothesised household has to say so in the same
    breath as it names them, or the card reads as evidence of a person.
