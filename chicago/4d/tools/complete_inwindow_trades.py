"""A HOUSE OF TRADE FOR EVERY IN-WINDOW TRADESMAN WHO HAD NONE (T-1404, of T-1182).

    python3 tools/complete_inwindow_trades.py            the population, read out
    python3 tools/complete_inwindow_trades.py --build    raise the houses and write the ledger
    python3 tools/complete_inwindow_trades.py --check    it re-derives, and nothing has drifted
    python3 tools/complete_inwindow_trades.py --self-test the rules below, held over fixtures

THE DEFECT. `tools/derive_resident_roles.py` gives every resident their trades as DATED
ROLES, and 78 of those rows reach 1 July 1835 on a person the business layer holds no
workplace for. Lemuel Brown is a blacksmith in window and there is no smithy; five
physicians practise and the layer counts three physicians' offices. The town therefore
printed men at trades that had nowhere to be carried on, and the December 1835 State
census's shortfall was being read as a hole in the town when part of it was a hole in the
LAYER — a house the research already names and nobody had written down.

WHAT IT WRITES, AND AT WHAT GRADE. A raised house is `inferred` and never `attested`. The
source says the man followed the trade at Chicago inside the window; that a man at this
trade kept a shop of his own is an inference ABOUT THE SHOP, and the shop's own record is
where that inference is declared. Nothing here is promoted, nobody is minted, no
coordinate is invented: every raised house takes an `unplaceable` location whose
`limit_reason` says that no reading places it and hands the seating to T-1198.

THE RULE IS DATA. `data/businesses/rulings/premises_rulings.json` rules each of the resident
layer's 110 occupations into `own_premises` or `no_fixed_premises`, and the
premises-implying set is the parent's: the `public_trades` and `works_trades` of the
signage rule, plus the lawyers' and physicians' offices the census counts. An occupation
with no ruling is a FAULT here, never a silent skip — a trade nobody has ruled on is a
tradesman who would vanish out of both halves of the clause.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO.

  * IT WILL NOT DOUBLE A MAN THE PAPER ALREADY PRINTED. 52 keepers in the register carry
    `person_id: null`, because the register could not match the printed name to a town
    card. Where an unlinked keeper shares a candidate's surname AND the house the register
    prints names that candidate's own occupation, the candidate is HELD and reported for
    the identity ruling T-1182 clause 1 owns. A different trade under the same surname is
    a different house and is raised. A collision the surname test cannot see — the
    register prints a trade in words the card does not use — is ruled by hand in the
    rulings' `identity_holds`, and E. H. Mulford the watchmaker is the one such hold
    today: T-1007 leaves it open whether he and the register's J. H. Mulford are one man,
    and raising him a shop would answer that by building.

  * IT WILL NOT RAISE TWO HOUSES WHERE THE EVIDENCE STANDS ONE. Rufus Brown and Mrs Rufus
    Brown both keep a boarding house in window and they keep the SAME boarding house; the
    record names both as proprietors rather than standing two roofs. And a man printed at
    two trades that each imply premises kept ONE house of trade unless something says
    otherwise — John H. Kinzie is a merchant and a forwarding and commission merchant in
    the same store — so trades sharing a keeper fold into one record carrying both census
    classes. Two DIFFERENT keepers of one household at two different trades still raise
    two houses: a storekeeping father and a smith son are two houses.

  * IT WILL NOT RECONSTRUCT. What the census counts and the layer still cannot name stays
    short, and the shortfall is the order book's — `businesses/physician` and
    `businesses/lawyer` are T-1186's buckets. This tool moves the `known` figure those
    buckets are cut against and orders nothing.

WHERE A HOUSE IS SEATED, AND WHERE IT IS NOT. 22 of the 45 keepers already carry a
`works_at` structure on their card, so the premises is not unknown at all — Rufus Brown's
boarding house, McKee's smithy on State Street, the Tremont. But `works_at` also holds
BUILT-BY links, which are not workplaces: Augustine Taylor "works at" St Mary's because he
raised it, and Anson Taylor at the South Branch raft bridge for the same reason. So the
link is taken only when the STRUCTURE'S OWN committed `function` is the term the premises
ruling names — a `boarding_house` for a boarding-house keeper, a `blacksmith_shop` for a
smith — and the rest fall to `unplaceable` and to T-1198. That test is the reason the
rulings file carries `signage_function` on every own-premises row.

THE CROSSWALK HAS TO SEE THIS. `tools/trade_census_1835.py` counted the newspaper register
alone, so a house raised here was invisible to the December census comparison and to the
order book cut from it — T-1186 would have been ordered to reconstruct eleven physicians
over a layer that now names eight. The crosswalk reads the authored layer as well as of
T-1404, and its deltas are re-printed with the raised houses in them.
