WHAT THE SOURCE IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. *The Genealogical Index of the Newberry
Library, Chicago* (G. K. Hall, 1960) is a four-volume photostat of the Newberry's
genealogical card index: hundreds of thousands of cards, each a family surname over
one line naming a locality, the work that treats the family there, its author, its
date and the pages, then the Newberry call number. It is a FINDING AID. A card never
places a person in Chicago in 1835 — it says WHERE A BOOK IS that might. So nothing
here grades a resident, a household or a business, and nothing here is payload; the
product of this file is a ranked list of books to open, and the surnames each one
may bear on.

The owner has put all four volumes on the Internet Archive under the identifier
`chicago1835-newberry-genealogical-index`, and that identifier is the canonical
locator: he is moving the research corpus there item by item, and a source record
that names the IA identifier survives the move where one naming a local path does
not.

HOW THE CARDS ARE READ, AND WHY IT IS DONE THIS WAY. The volumes carry a text
layer, and it is a poor one — the photostat is of typed and hand-corrected cards,
and the OCR of it drops letters, splits words and mangles diacritics ('Aldrich
family.' comes back as 'Aldrod foully.', 'Aldre,1 f a m i l y .' and worse). Worse
for a parser, `pdftotext -layout` reads the whole page as one text block and weaves
FOUR columns of cards into single lines, so a heading and the citation under it end
up in different lines with two other cards' text between them.

The repair is to read the page one column at a time. `pdftotext -x/-W` crops the
page before it lays anything out, so a single column comes back in card order:
heading, then the lines of that card, then the next heading. That is what --extract
does — four cropped passes over the whole volume, each card assembled from the
heading that opens it, and only the cards whose body names Chicago, Cook County or
Illinois are kept and committed.

WHAT IS COMMITTED, AND WHAT IS NOT. The four PDFs are ~200 MB each and are NOT
committed; `text/MANIFEST.json` carries each one's size and sha256, the exact crop
boxes, and the sha256 of every intermediate, so --extract can be re-run and shown to
produce the same file. What IS committed is `text/vol_NN_locality_cards.txt`: the
kept cards, verbatim as the text layer gives them, one card per stanza, with the
page and column they were cropped from. Every record's locator names its lines
there, and --check rebuilds every `as_read` out of it and fails on a one-character
difference — the newspapers' rule, and the reason a tidied reading cannot hide here.

THE GRADE. Every record is `transcription_mediated`. A machine's reading of a
photostat of a card is a transcription, and it is a bad one; calling it
`scan_verified` because the machine looked at an image would be exactly the upgrade
the provenance rule forbids. A sample is checked against the rendered page image by
hand and the check is recorded in the README, which is what the grade is worth.

A SHARED SURNAME IS A LEAD, NOT A MATCH — T-0505's discipline, and it binds harder
here than anywhere else in the project, because the index is nothing but surnames.
`leads.json` says which of this project's people COULD be the family a card points
at; it never says one is, and `crosswalk.json` holds no merges at all.

# counts one card twice.
#
# MEASURED on the committed reading before the rule was written. The sliver's body
# is a BYTE-EXACT prefix of the full card's body, because it is the same ink read
# twice by the same engine — the reader's own errors come through verbatim ('Pike
# Ce, III.', 'Fua Co., III.', 'Chicago, in.'). That exactness is the whole test.
# Matching on alpha() instead, which drops the digits and the stops, admits two
# DIFFERENT cards that cite the same county history: 'Sangamon Co, III. (Power, J.

# THE OTHER END OF THE SAME OVERLAP (T-0769). A sliver is what a crop window catches

# WIDE — 689 to 733 points across a volume — and the PREVIOUS column's text is pushed
# past the boundary: the fragment does not arrive as a card, it arrives glued to the
# FRONT of a real card's body, and the locality patterns then match on ink that is not
# on that card. `nbi_v02_0610` is the adjudicated one: 'Hallam | , 111.19 Hallam
# faaily.' opens with the eight characters that CLOSE the body of `Hall` in the column
# to its left, and `, 111.` is the Illinois abbreviation.
#
# THE TEST, and it is T-0601's argument run the other way: the fragment is the SAME INK
# READ TWICE BY THE SAME ENGINE, so the run has to be byte-exact — not alpha-folded,
# because the damage is the evidence — and it has to be a run two independent cards
# could not both reach. Length alone will not do that. Asking only for six byte-exact
# characters finds 113 candidates and most of them are a common formula: `Chicago,`
# opens 519 bodies in this domain, `Illinois` 285, `Pike Co., Ill.` 34, and two
# unrelated cards on one page share them constantly. So the run must also be UNIQUE —
# the prefix of no other body in the volume — which is what makes it this ink and not
# that formula.
#
# THE FIGURE THE RULE WAS EARNED ON, with the delta profile beside it as the ticket
# asked: 47 cards over the four volumes, EVERY ONE at column delta +1 — the card is one
# column right of the body its prefix closes — and NONE at any other delta. The same
# test without the uniqueness clause finds 113, of which 3 sit at delta 0, where the
# same column cannot bleed into itself and the crop geometry forbids the artefact. That
# control channel is empty under the rule and populated without it, which is the sense
# in which the rule has found the artefact rather than a word.
#
# 43 of the 47 carry NO LOCALITY once the fragment is taken off — they are in this
# domain solely for ink printed on the card to their left — and they are withheld from
# the counts, the leads and the reading order, exactly as a sliver is. Like a sliver
# they are MARKED and never dropped, and for the same three reasons: the id is
# positional, the ink is real and check() rebuilds every `as_read` out of the committed
# text, and a wrong call must stay visible. Trimming the body was the alternative and is
# refused: it would edit a reading, and MANIFEST.text_sha256 and check() would both
# refuse it — rightly, because a reading this project has tidied is a reading nobody can

# is exactly the shape of 'Cook Co., Ill.'. A regnal abbreviation in front of the
# stroke is what tells them apart.

# The second and third systematic false positives, both found by T-0578's forty-card
# draw on volume 2 and both absent from volume 1's draw (T-0600). They sit here, beside
# REGNAL, because they are the same kind of thing: a locality pattern matching something
# that is not a locality, and a written reason for telling them apart.

# ONE — THE STATE BANNER, AND ANY OTHER BODY THAT NAMES ONLY THE PLACE. The printed
# index divides a family's run of cards by state with a rule on its own line,
# 'ILLINOIS.'. `assemble` opens a card at a heading and hangs the lines under it on
# that card, so a banner falling directly beneath a heading becomes that card's whole
# body and the stanza is kept for a locality no card of that family claims —
# nbi_v02_1675 is the proof: its heading is 'Kinge or King family.', whose one card is
# an English parish register, and the surname run that opens under the banner is
# KINGERY. The same shape catches the wreck of the call-number column, '111. P 85132.8'.
#
# The test is not the spelling of the banner but what is missing: a card body is a
# CITATION — an author, a date, a title — and this domain's whole product is a list of
# books to open. Strip the locality the patterns matched and a real card still has
# words left; a banner has nothing. So a stanza whose body is the locality and no more
# names no work, can never become a lead, and is refused.

# TWO — THE STROKE STANDING WHERE THE CALL NUMBER STANDS. `illinois_abbreviated` is
# anchored to a comma or to the start of the line, and the start-of-line branch is
# there for a locality that wrapped: '..., Cook Co.,' on one line and 'Ill. (Andreas,
# A. T.) 1884-6' on the next. The left of a card also carries its call number, though
# ('543.7 LaSalle Co., Ill.'), and three strokes of a wrecked one read as 'III,' —
# nbi_v02_1106, whose card is 'Holden family. — Hapgood fam. (Hapgood, W.) 1898. See
# index. E. 7. H 21' and names no locality at all.
#
# What tells the two apart is what FOLLOWS. A wrapped locality is followed by its
# citation; a stroke in the call-number slot is followed by the next card's own family
# heading, because the crop has caught the head of a stanza and not the tail of one. So
# a start-of-line stroke with a family word behind it, before any citation opens, is
# refused. (The ticket proposed testing what PRECEDES the stroke instead. On the page
# there is nothing before it — the stroke IS the call number — so the test is the other
# way round; the measurement is written up in the PR.)

#
# WHY THERE IS A SECOND READER, AND WHICH VOLUME NEEDS IT (T-0614). Volume 4 is not the
# same scan as the other three. The Internet Archive item carries volumes 1-3 as
# `FL…_CP-130151_0N.pdf` and volume 4 as `130151_04.pdf`, and volume 4's embedded text
# layer is a much poorer OCR whose word boxes are scattered across the page instead of
# stacked in the four card columns — so cropping to a column, which is the whole trick
# above, no longer isolates one. Run over volume 4 the text-layer path assembles 6,548
# cards and keeps 308 out of 918 pages, against volume 3's 68,552 and 2,131 out of
# 1,004. The page IMAGES are perfectly legible; only the text layer is not. So the
# volume is read by re-reading the images.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT CHANGE. The OCR path produces the same four column texts the
# pdftotext path produces and hands them to the same `assemble`. Nothing downstream
# knows the difference, and the grade does not move: `transcription_mediated` was
# already the right grade for a machine reading a photostat, and a second machine
# reading it does not make it stronger.
#
# WHY IT IS RESUMABLE. At the measured rate the volume is about 83 minutes of compute,
# which does not fit in one run's foreground. `--pages A-B` reads a range and commits a
# shard; `--extract --ocr` with no range stitches the shards in page order. A shard
# records the settings it was made with and stitching refuses a set that disagrees,
# because two ranges read at different dpi are two different readings of one volume.

# ------------------------------------------------- the re-derivation fingerprint

# T-0740. `--parse` is deterministic over TWO inputs: the committed card text, and the
# layers the leads are looked up in — the households, the 1833-1835 voter lists, the
# 1840 census pages and the named structures. The card text is gated already (its
# sha256 is in MANIFEST). The LAYERS are not, and they are the ones that move: a
# cohort lands, a census page is read, a household is renamed, and the committed
# leads quietly stop being what a fresh parse produces. Nothing was wrong in the
# files; they were just old, and the gate could not see it because it re-derived the
# crosswalk from the COMMITTED leads rather than from the inputs.
#
# Re-parsing inside the gate would cost four minutes (64 s a volume, measured), which
# is four minutes on every commit to catch a drift that happens weekly. So the gate
# hashes the inputs instead. A fingerprint that still matches means a re-parse is a
# no-op; one that does not means the leads are stale and must be regenerated AND
# re-ruled (tools/rule_newberry_leads.py --write), because new leads arrive unruled.
