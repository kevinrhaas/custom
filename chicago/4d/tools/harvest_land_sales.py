"""Fetch the Illinois State Archives land tract sales and write the committed deposit.

    tools/harvest_land_sales.py --sweep [--tr 39:14 --tr 40:14]
    tools/harvest_land_sales.py --county-list COOK [--through-year 1836]
    tools/harvest_land_sales.py --sectionless COOK [--stop-after 150 --cache DIR]

A TOWNSHIP IS A TOWNSHIP AND A RANGE (T-0676). The sweep asks for the pairs given to
`--tr`, defaulting to the two the town stands on; `--township 39` is the older spelling
and still means T39N R14E. Each set of pairs writes its own deposit, named after them.

THIS REACHES THE NETWORK, so it is run deliberately by a research pass and never by
`tools/check.sh`. Its output — `data/research/land_sales/text/*.tsv` — is committed,
and `tools/read_land_sales.py` derives everything else from that file offline. That
split is the civic domain's (`sweep_voter_second_sources.py`), for the same reason:
a gate that needs the internet is a gate that goes red for reasons that are not the
repo's.

TWO THINGS ABOUT THE SOURCE, both learned the hard way on T-0557.

1. THE SEARCH RETURNS AT MOST 150 ROWS PER PAGE — AND IT DOES PAGE (T-0675). The
   ceiling is real: a whole-township query stops at 150 and looks complete, which is
   why the sweep still asks SECTION BY SECTION, thirty-six queries per township. But
   the results page carries a **More** button, and that button is a keyset cursor:
   `hiddenPurchaseNo` + `hiddenPurchaser` + `hiddenSectionNo`, replayed against the
   same search, return the rows after the last one shown. Results are ordered by
   purchaser, so the cursor walks a section to its end. `walk_section` below follows
   it, and T-0557's three "truncated" sections — T39N R14E 16, 21 and 29 — were
   truncated only because the first pass took the More button for a dead end.
   The `name` field belongs to a different search form and does NOT narrow a
   legal-description query — it replaces it, returning that name from every township
   in Illinois, so it cannot be used to break a section into smaller pieces.

3. A SECTION QUERY CANNOT SEE A ROW THAT HAS NO SECTION (T-0830). The register
   describes a town lot by its plat — `L2BL46CHIOT` — and leaves Section, Township,
   Range and Meridian EMPTY. There is no section number such a row answers to, so no
   number of section queries will ever return it, however completely each one is
   walked. `--county-list` is the query that can: county alone, walked to its end
   through the same cursor, which is the whole county's list page and therefore holds
   the sectionless rows too. It writes the LIST columns only — the nine the results
   page prints — because it exists to say what a sweep is missing, not to replace the
   detail pages a sweep fetches.

   `--sectionless` is what READS them (T-1030). It takes the committed county list,
   selects the rows whose Section column is empty, and fetches each one's detail page
   exactly as the sweep does — so the deposit it writes carries the sweep's seventeen
   columns and not the list's nine. There is no section query to walk here and none is
   invented: the list page named the rows, and each is asked for by purchase number,
   which is the one handle a sectionless row has. `--stop-after N` fetches at most N
   NEW detail pages and writes what it has, because 619 pages at the reader's pace is
   half an hour and a foreground run is capped below that; the partial deposit is
   carried forward by `held_rows` on the next pass, so the reading resumes where it
   stopped and never re-asks for a page the file already holds.

2. THE SITE REFUSES DATACENTRE ADDRESSES. Every user agent from this runner's Azure
   address gets a bare 403 from the WAF. The sweep therefore fetches through the
   public r.jina.ai reader, which returns the origin's own HTML unchanged; the
   `--direct` flag asks for the origin instead, for anyone running this from a
   machine the site will talk to. Which route was used is recorded in the source
   record, and it changes nothing about what the page says.
