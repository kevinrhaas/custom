"""Generate one platted block of anonymous infill from the 665-roof schedule.

ROADMAP T-A2 onward. The three parcels before this one — phase-one South, the West
approaches, the North Division cluster — each authored their own coordinates: a row
northing and a list of eastings, or a centre per slot. That was the only thing
available before the plat module existed. It does not survive the module: the block
and lot grid (`tools/generate_plat_lots.py`, ROADMAP K7) knows where the lots are, and
a recipe that retypes coordinates beside it is a second opinion about the same ground.
The K7 slice found seven buildings standing in the road for exactly that reason.

So this generator authors NO coordinates. The recipe says which family stands on which
lot and whether it fronts the street or the alley; every metre comes from the committed
lot polygon. That is also what makes the parcel shape repeat (T-A3…T-An): the next block
is a recipe entry, not a new geometry argument.

**Family geometry comes from the crosswalk, not from this file.**
`data/reconstruction/1835_family_archetype_crosswalk.json` already carries, per family,
the footprint band, the storey count, the eave height and the placeholder archetype it
resolves through. The earlier generators retyped some of that into Python and could only
build the families somebody had retyped — which is why `family_bands_ft` in the building
inventory has no H1 or H2 band at all, while the schedule apportions H1 and H2 to this
very block. Read where the numbers are authored and every family the programme can name
becomes buildable. The crosswalk agrees with `family_bands_ft` on all 21 families both
of them carry; it also covers the 14 they do not.

Every record this writes is an invention: an anonymous count-unit toward a documented
aggregate. Presence, position, footprint and every form value grade at the bottom tier
with a reasoning note, and no lot is numbered — this project has never read Thompson's
numbering off a sheet, and standing on a generated lot is not standing on a recovered one.

    **The rear edge is the one nearest the alley STRIP, not the alley's centroid,

    centroid sits at the block's own centre, so for an END lot the side lot line
    running back toward that centre is very nearly as close to it as the lot's alley
    edge is: on `blk_randolph_dearborn` the two came out 38.93 m and 38.95 m apart —
    two centimetres over a thirty-nine metre lever — and two of that block's four end
    lots picked the side lot line. A building framed off a side line stands broadside
    to its own street and hangs over the neighbouring lot; the margin gate caught it
    at 1.44 m against a 1.5 m bound, which is a millimetre-scale complaint about a

    0.2 m and 26.3 m. `blk_randolph_wells` cleared the centroid tie by 1.3 m in 37 —

# The placements above are one principal roof per lot, centred on its own lot at a
# typology setback with a lateral nudge. That is a DISTRIBUTION of roofs across a
# block, and it is the right shape for a residential back street. It is the wrong
# shape for the town's business front: the owner's reference for South Water Street
# in 1834 shows the south bank as a CONTINUOUS working row — one-storey log and frame
# buildings shoulder to shoulder facing the river, the street between them and the
# grassy bank — and this row rendered as detached cottages seven metres back from the
# frontage, each looking away from the river at the block's interior.
#
# So a slot may say instead that it stands ON the block face, and it then takes three
# things from the committed plat rather than from the recipe: the line it fronts, the
# bearing of that line, and where along it its east wall lands. Nothing here authors a
# coordinate. A run is anchored either on the east end of its own frontage or on the
# wall of a building already standing on the face, and it packs west from there.
#
# What the run gives up is the one-roof-per-lot geometry, and the trade is stated
# rather than assumed: the side lot lines inside a run are conjectural — every record
# this generator writes has always said so — while the block face is not. A row is a
# claim about the FACE. The lots it was dealt are named on the block's `frontage`
# entry so the ledger can still count them, and the strip's OUTER lines keep the same
# margin every other roof here keeps.

    # three roofs from the pre-plat West parcel stand on three of its eight lots,
    # placed from typed coordinates before the plat module existed, so nothing in
    # the dataset says which lot they are on. A free lot and a lot with somebody
    # else's house on it looked identical here, and the three-metre separation
    # gate does not close the difference: two principal roofs can stand twelve
    # metres apart on one twenty-five-metre lot and pass every test in this file.
    #
    # A lot is occupied by the footprint standing on it, so occupancy is DERIVED
    # from the committed records rather than authored in the recipe — a recipe
    # that had to be told which lots were taken would be a second opinion about
    # the same ground, which is the defect the plat module exists to retire.

    # T-A7: it is derived by the footprint's OVERLAP with the lot, in the module the
    # schedule itself calls, because the centroid it used to read is a proxy that
    # fails on exactly the records this gate exists for. A building placed from typed
    # coordinates before the plat module existed can stand a metre proud of its own
    # frontage: its centroid is then in the roadway and its walls are on the lot. Three
    # documented buildings on this grid do it, and the block this parcel shape met them
