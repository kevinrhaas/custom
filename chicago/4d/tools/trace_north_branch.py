"""Trace the North Branch north of the forks window, off Wright 1834.

The northern companion to `tools/trace_south_branch.py`, and the last of the
three windows the river needs on this sheet. `tools/trace_river.py` stops at the
forks box; Wright draws the North Branch on past it, out of the Original Town,
across Kinzie Street and up the length of Wabansia — past the water lots of
Kain's and Hight's subdivision and the blocks lettered Right and Owen — to the
line he ruled across the top of his survey.

    python3 tools/trace_north_branch.py            re-trace and write the GeoJSON
    python3 tools/trace_north_branch.py --check    re-trace and diff against committed
    python3 tools/trace_north_branch.py --debug    also write a PNG overlay
    python3 tools/trace_north_branch.py --check-properties
                                                   hold the committed file to this
                                                   file's literals: no numpy, no
                                                   network. This one IS in check.sh.

A fourth window, spliced on a declared row
------------------------------------------
Same reasoning as the South Branch, mirrored: the forks work at a LOCAL block
percentile, so widening that window would move every vertex the forks trace has
already committed and the ground is carved from those vertices. This is a
separate window whose SOUTH edge is the forks window's NORTH edge (map row
1252 — `trace_river`'s REGION starts there), which makes the splice a declared
line rather than a tolerance. `river.geojson` is not read and not rewritten.

The hue tolerance, and the wash that made it move
-------------------------------------------------
The forks settings carry north unchanged except for one: `hue_tol`, 11 -> 7.

`wash_mask` separates Wright's grey bank wash from his coloured ward washes by
how far a pixel's hue departs from the local paper's. On Wabansia's river front
that separation is the narrowest it is anywhere on the sheet. Medians over a
13-row band at map row 745, across the west bank: the green wash on the
river-front lots reads R-B 27, G-B 31; the grey bank wash beside it reads R-B 32,
G-B 19; the paper of the channel between the banks reads R-B 40, G-B 26. Green
and grey differ by one channel and by thirteen units of it, and at a tolerance of
11 the green passes as bank. It is not a small error: at `hue_tol` 8 the traced west
bank steps 131 px — 93 m — into the lots at row 800, and the polygon published
as river would have covered ground Wright drew as platted lots with lot lines
across it.

7 is the value the argument lands on and 6 is the other one that works; at 5 the
upper reach's own bank wash starts going out with the colours and the trace
breaks at row 764. The whole usable band is two wide, which is why this is
argued from the pixels above rather than tuned. It is paid for on the east bank,
which sits a median 1.4 m inside Wright's ink but is short of it by more than
10 m on 81 of the reach's 932 rows — rows 728-779, and the last 30 rows at the
splice. docs/RESEARCH/north_branch_wabansia.md § 5 states the trade and the
measurement; it is filed rather than hidden.

North of the survey there is no river
-------------------------------------
Wright ruled a line across the top of the sheet and washed the river up to it,
so the channel's north end is where he stopped drawing, not where the river
stopped running: the North Branch ran on to the Skokie marshes for miles past
anything on this plat. The terminal stretch is dropped for exactly the reason
`trace_south_branch.py` drops its southern one — publishing it would assert a
river end this sheet never drew — and it cannot be told by the ink, because at
this terminus there IS a line: the survey's own north boundary, drawn across the
channel.

Needs numpy, scipy, Pillow and the network. Like the other three traces the full
re-run is a deliberate, occasional one and is not part of tools/check.sh; it
degrades to a clear skip when the dependencies are missing. `--check-properties`
is the half that costs nothing, and check.sh runs it.
