WHAT THIS PASS IS, AND THE RULING IT APPLIES.

The owner ratified a grading ladder on 2026-09-03 — quoted in full in T-0514 and in
`docs/RESEARCH/resident-grading-policy.md` — and T-0513 spent it: `tools/consolidate_
resident_evidence.py --build` reads the seven source domains, clusters them into
identities, and writes `data/research/residents/grading_proposal.json`, which says per
identity what the ladder makes of it. That file is a PROPOSAL and nothing in it was ever
written onto a card. Measured on `dev` before this pass: of the 85 men on the 1835 poll
list only 37 had even a surname in the residents layer. Half the voter-list men — Bread,
Pixby, Kennicott, Ulrich, Trowbridge, Alvin Calhoun — were in no record at all, and the
muster rolls, the tax list, the St Cyr register and the death notices were in the same
position.

This pass writes those people. It mints a household and a person for every identity the
proposal grades `attested` or `inferred` (`projected_resident` included) that the town
does not already carry, on the evidence of the CIVIC lists (poll, tax, muster), the
CHURCH register, the contemporary PRESS, the BOOKS (the two directories and the old
settlers' death notices) and the 1840 CENSUS — every domain except the post office's
lists of uncalled-for letters, which belongs to the pass beside this one.

NO COUNT IS WRITTEN DOWN HERE, DELIBERATELY, for the reason
`mint_letter_list_residents.py` gives at length: the corpus grows most weeks the loop
runs and a figure copied into prose is wrong by the next transcription. Run `--report`
for the mint and every refusal, `--scale` for what the pass is worth to the town.

WHERE IT SITS AMONG THE MINTS, AND WHY IT IS BESIDE THE LETTER LISTS RATHER THAN ABOVE.

T-0514 asked for this pass ABOVE `mint_letter_list_residents.py` in the precedence
`mint_documented_residents.MINTED_PREFIXES` documents, so that where two passes reach
for one family name the better-evidenced one keeps it. Working it showed the precedence
is not what these two passes need, and refusal 3 is why.

That refusal makes the two pools DISJOINT by construction: an identity whose only source
inside the scene year is a post-office letter list is refused here, because the pass
beside this one has already ruled on exactly that pool and the owner's ruling of
2026-08-30 held all of it. Nothing this pass mints rests on a letter list, and nothing
the letter-list pass mints rests on anything else. Two passes over disjoint pools do not
need a precedence between them.

What they do need is not to read each other's output as a prior claim, and that IS a
change to the family-name test: `town_family_names`'s `skip` now carries `("civic",
"hh_civic_")` in all three older mints. The reason is that refusal — "the town already
names a <Surname>" — is a proxy for identity resolution over evidence that is a bare
name, and it is the right proxy there: a letter addressed to `Smith` at Chicago is
probably the Smith the town already holds. This pass does not need the proxy. Its
identities come from the consolidation, which resolves on surname AND forename
signature against every domain at once, and refusal 2 hands back every identity that
resolution reaches. Letting the older passes see these households instead would retire
hundreds of committed letter-list records on a surname collision alone — a deletion the
owner has not ruled on, and the opposite of the one he did make.

WHAT THE RECORD CLAIMS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO.

The same claim the three passes before it make, and no more: a PERSON, inside a
household container that is the only way `data/residents/` can carry one. `division` is
`unplaced`; `lives_at` and `works_at` are null with the note saying why — the placement
sweep assigns homes and workplaces once the resident list is complete, which is the
owner's own sequencing and not this pass's to pre-empt. `occupation` reads
`none_recorded`, the residents vocabulary's own word for an absent record: a poll list,
a muster roll and a baptismal entry each print a name and no trade, and where a later
directory prints one it is a trade of 1843, which T-0633 exists to back-project under a
rule this pass does not have. `origin`, `party_size_on_arrival`, `reason_for_coming` and
the family are each written unattested in their own block. No figure is drawn (L1).

`arrival` is a BOUND and says so: `not_later_than` the earliest record inside the scene
year that names the person, at that record's own precision — a full date where the
paper gives one, the year's end where a list gives only a year. Where that bound falls
after 1 July 1835 the validator warns that it straddles the scene date; the note says so
in words, which is what the validator asks for, and `present_on_scene_date` is
`uncertain` rather than `present` for exactly those people.

`present_on_scene_date` is `present` only where the record BRACKETS the day — the person
is named at Chicago at or before 1 July 1835 and named again at or after it. Everyone
else is `uncertain` with the reason: the lists stop before the scene date and nothing
follows them to it. `uncertain` rather than dropped is the distinction index.json draws
for Jeremiah Porter, and it is a finding, not a gap.

THE EVIDENCE BLOCKS, and one deviation from the ticket that is recorded rather than
hidden. T-0514 asked for `civic_evidence[]`, `census_evidence[]` (1830),
`church_evidence[]` and `book_evidence[]`. Four notes on that:

  * There is no 1830 census domain in the consolidation to read — `read_census_1840` is
    the only census reader it has, and `census_1830_peoria_county_chicago_precinct` is a
    source the identity master never offers. `census_evidence[]` therefore carries 1840
    rows, which are LATER evidence and can never be a residency source on their own
    (refusal 3 and the ladder's G0 both say so); they corroborate a person the scene-year
    record already reaches.
  * `press_evidence[]` is added, because the ticket's four blocks have no home for the
    contemporary newspapers and the ladder's G1b — a Chicago paper of 1833-1835 printing
    the person by name in the town — is the largest single rung in this pool.
  * Every row carries the ladder rule id that fired for the identity, the list it was
    read from, the transcription AS READ, the locator and the source id, so a card can
    show the reading and a reader can go back to the page.
  * The books are the two directories and the old settlers' death notices together:
    both are a later book's recollection of an earlier town, and the ladder treats them
    the same way.

THE TENSION WITH `mint_placed_residents.py`, stated rather than buried. That pass put
the register's tradeless `new_resident` people through a residency test derived from the
corpus (L213) and refused 382 of them — "a name printed in a Chicago paper is not a
Chicago resident". The owner's ladder, ratified a fortnight later, reads the same
evidence differently at G1b. This pass applies the ladder, because the ladder is the
ratified rule and T-0514 is the instruction to spend it; `--report` counts how many of
the people it mints that older test had refused, so the disagreement stays visible and
countable instead of being settled quietly. docs/LIBERTIES.md L215 is where it is
admitted.

THE REFUSALS, in the order they fire, each one printed by `--report`:

  1. `the ladder does not reach this identity`   — the proposal grades it
     `not_1835_resident` or abstains (G0, G5). Nothing is minted from an 1839 directory
     or an 1840 census appearance alone, which is the ladder's own first sentence.
  2. `the town already carries this person`      — the consolidation resolved the
     identity onto a committed card. T-0515 regrades those; this pass never touches one.
  3. `the town has researched this person and left them out` — index.json's
     `researched_not_resident` list is the exclusions-style half of this dataset and it
     outranks any mint. A finding that somebody is NOT in this scene was argued once and
     is not quietly reversed by a pass that reads the same name off a list.
  4. `an 1832 enrollment alone is earlier evidence and never mints` — the Black Hawk War
     enrollment record states its own ladder: "An 1832 enrollment is EARLIER evidence and
     never an 1835 residence on its own: it places the man in this town in 1832, which is
     why it dates and corroborates rather than mints"
     (`data/research/civic/records/blackhawk_war_1832_chicago.json`, `the_ladder`). That
     reading is the project's and this pass does not overturn it from a rung the
     consolidation assigns generically. It also keeps this pass away from the 94 rows the
     index prints in the INDIAN company with no surname comma at all: their names cannot
     be read in a surname-first model without inventing an order for them, and any record
     touching the removal is subject to AGENTS.md's standing constraint rather than to a
     mint tool's judgement.
  5. `the post office's letter lists are the pass beside this one's pool` — every
     appearance inside the scene year is a letter list. See above.
 5b. `every scene-year reading is a church entry the register places outside Chicago`
     — St Cyr married three couples at Bear Creek, Sangamon County in May 1834 and his
     register carries those entries beside the Chicago ones. The rows say so themselves
     (`at_chicago: false`); this pass reads the field and mints nobody off them. T-1129.
  6. `a firm, not a person` — and it fires before the surname rule below, because "&
     Co" reads as a two-letter family name and the firm is the truer finding.
  7. `the transcription bracketed the name as uncertain`.
  8. `no name the corpus prints as a family name` — nothing that could be a surname.
  9. `no appearance inside the scene year` — there is no record to bound an arrival at
     or before the scene date with, so minting one would assert an arrival the sources
     do not reach. A later-only source is never a residency source.
 10. `a duplicate of a person the town already carries` — the id this identity would
     take is already a person's. The consolidation did not link them and this pass will
     not overwrite a card to find out; it is a merge for the consolidation to make.
 12. `no evidence block this pass writes` — no appearance in a domain with a block.

# prints "some of Chicago's Old Settlers, prior to 1843, and other well - known citizens
# who arrived after 1843, together with others prominently connected with Illinois
# history". Nothing read the field, so the refusal existed in the corpus and not in any

# a man who died at Chicago in 1885 was at Chicago in 1885. So a class the field refuses
# may still close the bracket from above, and a blanket refusal would have been wrong on
# seven cards whose only at-or-after leg is a death notice. `tax_1833` is refused on

# three couples in a house at Bear Creek, Sangamon County, and his register carries those
# entries on the same pages as the Chicago ones. The reader that transcribed it said so
# on every affected row — `at_chicago: false`, with the footnote that places them — and

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# T-0515 — the SECOND mode: regrade the people the town already carries
#
# `--build` above mints the identities the town does NOT hold. Its refusal 2 —
# "the town already carries this person" — hands every one of the others to this
# mode, and `grading_proposal.json` lists them as `changes_to_existing_people`:
# 162 rows, each a rule of the owner's ratified ladder fired against an identity
# whose card is already committed.
#
# THE TWO RULES THIS MODE IS BUILT AROUND, both from the ticket and both about
# what the ladder may NOT do:
#
#   * "nothing may be graded DOWN without a recorded refusal". A downgrade is
#     therefore never silent here. Where it fires, the grade it takes away is
#     written onto the person as a refusal with the rule that took it; where it
#     is declined, the decline is written the same way. Either way the reading
#     is on the card and a later run can see it was ruled on rather than missed.
#
#   * The consolidation sees SEVEN domains and no more. Its own G5 says so in
#     the ladder's words — it "abstains rather than demote a resident on evidence
#     it has not read". That abstention is a proposal with no grade in it and is
#     refused here rather than applied. And the same reasoning reaches further
#     than G5 does: 44 of the 45 downgrades this proposal offers fall on cards
#     that cite Andreas, Kinzie's Waubun, a dated Democrat issue or a research
#     package the consolidation never read. A rung fired on the evidence it
#     could see is not a finding about the evidence it could not, so those are
#     declined for the reason G5 declines its own, and the decline is recorded.
#     The one downgrade whose card cites nothing outside the ladder's field of
#     view is applied.
#
# WHAT IT WRITES on a person it regrades: `grade`, `resident_subtype`, the
# per-domain evidence blocks `evidence_blocks()` derives for the mint above, the
# union of the sources those rows cite, and a `resident_research` stamp naming
# the rule and the date. Everything else on the card belongs to the pass that
# wrote it and is left alone. The write is a pure function of the proposal, the
# identity master and the committed tree, so `--regrade --check` re-derives it —
# and reads its own answer back the way `--build` does. Once a regrade lands, the
# consolidation rebuilds against the card it wrote and stops proposing the change,
# so the steady state is nought applied with the refusals still standing. A hand-edit
# to one of those grades puts the proposal back and the gate says so, which is the
# thing it is there to catch.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# THE NAME TEST THE REGRADE OWES, and the reason it exists. The consolidation
# merges an identity on a surname and a compatible forename, and its D-rules are
# loose enough that `id_albee_clark_b` — Clark B. Albee, printed once by the post
# office — carries Fergus's 1843 line for *Cyrus P.* Albee. Read naively, that
# line is the second source that takes `projected_resident` off him. It is not:
# it is a different man with the same surname. So an evidence row corroborates
# here only when the forename it prints AGREES with the identity's — the same
# word, an initial, or one of the abbreviations these volumes actually set. Rows
# that fail are not attached and do not count towards a rung, and a proposal left
# with nothing is refused as one the evidence rows do not support.
#
# The abbreviations are the printers' own, taken from the entries in the corpus
# rather than invented: a directory of the 1840s sets Wm., Jas., Chas., Thos.
