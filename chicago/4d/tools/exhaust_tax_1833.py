"""Peter Pruyne against Peter Pryne: the exhaustion over the 1833 tax roll.

T-1135. T-1132 ruled the Pruyne/Pryne pair UNDECIDED under U1 and wrote down what
would settle it: "Not a page but a COUNT, in C12's shape moved from the forename to
the surname." This tool is that count. It is the arithmetic and not the ruling — the
ruling is hand-authored at data/residents/card_merge_rulings.json, cluster
`pruyne-pryne`, and reasoned out at docs/RESEARCH/pruyne_pryne_exhaustion.md.

THE THREE GATES, in the order a reader should refuse them.

  A — DOES THE ROLL HAVE TO CARRY HIM? C12's second condition asks for an INDEPENDENT
      NON-NAME FACT putting the survivor on the closed roll. The fact offered is
      ground: the 1833 tax list is a roll of the owners and estates of ground inside
      the town (T-1117, town_findings_voter_lists v005), and the Illinois State
      Archives tract register has Peter Pruyne buying at the school-section auction of
      22-25 October 1833. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN AND T-1017 SAYS SO: buying at
      that sale was measured and REFUSED as a check on a town-side name. So the gate
      does not ask whether he bought there. It asks WHERE THE GROUND IS, against the
      ring the Trustees walked on 7 November 1833, and it prints both answers — the
      two rows that fall inside the corporate line and the two that fall outside it.

  B — IS ANY OTHER ENTRY LEFT FOR HIM? The exhaustion, run over the WHOLE roll and
      printed. Every one of the 115 entries is scored by the letters between its
      surname and `pruyne`, because the varying half here is the surname and a count
      over the handful of entries that share the forename would not close: thirteen
      entries on this roll print no forename at all. THE RULE NEVER FOLDS ON A
      RESEMBLANCE. It EXCLUDES on a difference, which is the safe direction: saying
      that `beaubien` is not a printing of `pruyne` asks nothing of a reader's
      willingness to believe, where saying that `pryne` is would ask everything.

  C — IS A CLERK CAUGHT DISTINGUISHING THEM? D5's discriminator, and the thing that
      would refuse the merge outright: a closed roll that enters BOTH spellings as
      separate entries. Scored over every committed source text in the corpus.
