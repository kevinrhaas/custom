"""T-1371 (of T-1175), stage `lodgers` — the boarders, in the beds the town had.

WHAT THIS STAGE IS. T-1370 gave every lodging place the dataset holds an ordinary-night
and a full capacity and seated nobody in them: fifteen built houses with 135 ordinary
beds between them, and thirty people on their cards — eight keepers and their families.
This stage fills the ordinary-night figure. It is piece 2 of 3 of T-1175; piece 3
(T-1372) has the crews of the vessels in port, the hands at the works, and the card that
prints who lived in a house.

THE ORDER THE BEDS ARE FILLED IN, and it is the parent ticket's, not this tool's.

  1. THE SOLITARY HEADS THE HOUSEHOLD MODEL ALREADY DREW. Two stages of this programme
     have already decided that a man kept no family: T-1171 drew five named heads as
     `solitary`, and T-1173 drew fourteen of its trade heads at a household size of one.
     Nineteen people the model itself says lived alone, none of whom has a roof. They are
     seated FIRST, because a bed filled by somebody the layer already holds is a bed that
     costs the town nothing — it is not a new person, it is a person given somewhere to
     sleep, and it takes a house off the lot queue T-1199 would otherwise have to find
     ground for.

  2. THE SHORT BEDS, filled with lodgers drawn against the order book's own
     `household_type: lodging` buckets. Nothing is invented past the quota: the book
     ordered 544 people into lodging households and this piece spends part of that order.

  3. THE KEEPER. A reconstructed lodging house with no keeper is not a lodging house, so
     the five roofs the reconstruction programme raised as lodging places are given one,
     at the trade their own `function` states. A NAMED house is never given a keeper:
     who kept the New York House in 1835 is a research question and inventing an answer
     would put a fabricated proprietor into a documented building.

THE MIX. Professionals and land agents at the Tremont, the Sauganash and the Mansion
House; mechanics at the Green Tree, the Steamboat and the smaller houses; labourers and
the people no roster gives a trade on the floors of the boarding houses. That is the
parent ticket's sentence, implemented as the literal named lists it gives, because the
grouping is NOT the same as the records' `function` field — the Steamboat Hotel is a
`hotel` and stands in the mechanics' list all the same. A seat is a RULE and not a draw:
the house with the most free beds in the group takes the next person, ties broken on the
id, so two runs over one layer seat the same people in the same houses without a seed.

WHAT IT REFUSES, each one written rather than quietly taken.

  1. NO DIVISION, NO MINT. A person drawn into a lodging house has to be ordered out of
     the book's bucket for a division, and this dataset states a structure's division
     nowhere: `data/structures/*.json` carries no division field at all. Where a
     household the residents layer already attaches to the house gives one, or where the
     reconstruction programme raised the roof in a named district, the division is read
     off that. Where neither does — the New York House and the Sauganash Hotel, two
     documented houses the residents layer attaches nobody to — THIS STAGE MINTS NOBODY.
     Their beds stand empty and the ledger says why. Seating somebody already in the
     layer there is still allowed, because a person the town already counts needs no
     bucket.

  2. NO TRADE IS DEALT. The book's `lodging/trade` buckets want working lodgers and this
     stage does not fill them, because dealing a trade is T-1173's machinery and the
     1839 directory's shares are its table. The lodgers minted here carry
     `none_recorded`, the same as the people the rosters print without one, and the
     `lodging/trade` order stays open for the stage that can price it. The only trade
     written anywhere here is a minted keeper's, and that is read off the building's own
     `function` rather than dealt.

  3. NO CHILDREN. The book orders 156 people under ten into lodging households. They are
     the keepers' own families, not boarders — a child does not take a bed at a tavern on
     their own account — so this stage draws only the adult and adolescent bands and
     leaves the `under_10` lodging order to the stage that completes a keeper's family.

  4. NO KEEPER'S FAMILY IS DRAWN. "With each keeper's own household complete" is in this
     ticket's title, and the completion is NOT this stage's to make: the kin of a
     household are `family/none` in the order book and that quota belongs to T-1171 and
     T-1174. What this stage does instead is STATE the shortfall — the `keepers` table
     names every lodging place's keeper, how many people stand on their card, and the
     ticket that owes them the rest. Piece 1 of this same parent (T-1370) refused the
     staffing model in its own title for the same reason and named T-1183; this is that
     refusal made twice, which is what a split ticket looks like when the title was
     written before the dependency was read.

  5. A KEEPER IS NOT ANOTHER HOUSE'S BOARDER. Two of T-1173's fourteen solitary heads are
     boarding-house keepers. They are held out of the boarder pool and not seated: their
     division is the order book's and this stage may not move it, so which house they
     kept is T-1199's placement question.

WHERE THE CARDS LIVE. `data/residents/lodgers/`, beside T-1172's `readmitted/` and
T-1347's `reconstructed_trades/`, and for the same reason: `data/residents/households/`
is re-derived by the research mints and `data/residents/index.json` is derived from that
directory, so a reconstruction that is not a reading lives outside both and is overlaid
onto the scene by `tools/compile_scene.py`. Nothing here reaches back into a research
card — a seated head keeps their own card untouched and the seat is carried in this
stage's ledger, which is the same shape T-1172's presence rulings already use.

EVERY VALUE IS REPRODUCIBLE. Each drawn value comes from `blake2s(seed)` over a seed a
reader can retype, and the seed is printed on the record that carries it. `--check`
re-derives the whole directory and refuses a single differing byte.
