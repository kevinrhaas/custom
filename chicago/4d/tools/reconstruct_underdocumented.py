"""T-1376, stage `underdocumented` — the men of the company the 1832 roll heads INDIAN.

WHAT THIS STAGE IS, AND THE COUNT THAT MADE IT NECESSARY. The Illinois State Archives
index of Black Hawk War enrollments prints 134 men enrolled AT CHICAGO in 1832 in two
companies: forty under `G KERCHEVAL` and ninety-four under a company the roll heads,
in that column and in that word, `INDIAN`. The borderline roster (T-1172's input) sorted
those 134 rows into two classes by the same rule it uses on everybody — R3 for the muster,
R6 for a reading carrying a Native, Metis or Black community term — and T-1172 spent R3
and left R6 for T-1177. It then re-admitted **twenty of the forty men of Kercheval's
company and none of the ninety-four of the other one**. Same roll. Same year. Same page.
The only thing that separated them was which class the community term put them in, and
that class had no ticket to spend it.

This stage spends the Native and Metis part of R6. It is the FIRST stage of this
programme permitted to write a Native or Metis person — the programme file says so and
`reconstruct_residents_1835.check_reconstructed_person` enforces it — and every record it
writes carries `review_required` and `touches_removal` with the sentence that says why.

THE LICENCE IS R3's, WORD FOR WORD, AND IT IS BORROWED ON PURPOSE. R3 reads: "A name on
the 1 April 1834 post-office return or the 1832 Black Hawk muster enrolled at Chicago,
with no 1835 corroboration and no card. Licence: Mint reconstructed, presence bounded by
the persistence rate." Every man carded here answers that description exactly. Nothing
about the evidence differs; only the class does. So the presence draw is the same
persistence model, seeded the same way, and a card minted here is worth neither more nor
less than one of Kercheval's men.

THREE THINGS THIS STAGE DOES DIFFERENTLY FROM T-1172, AND WHY.

  1. A ONE-WORD NAME IS STILL A NAME. T-1172 withholds a reading that gives no surname
     and forename together (`not_a_whole_name`), which is the right rule for a land index
     that clipped `CHIPMAN` off `CHIPMAN ANSEL`. Applied to this company it is not a rule
     about evidence at all, it is a rule about European naming: `Cau be nah`, `Mas go` and
     `Ke o quaw` are whole names, printed whole, and a mint that requires a surname would
     refuse every one of them and call it rigour. So the test here is on the READING and
     not on its shape: a name the roll prints as a name is a name, it is carried `as_read`,
     no surname is invented for it and no given/family split is imposed on it.
     What IS still refused is a ONE-WORD EUROPEAN SURNAME — `Beaubien`, `Morgan`,
     `Crafts`, `Chamblee`, `Francois` — because there the roll clipped a name this town
     carries several of, and the row gives nothing to tell which man it is.

  2. THE TERM MUST BE A STATEMENT AND NOT A WORD IN THE PROSE. The roster's R6 rule is
     `community_term_in_the_reading`, a text match, and a text match over-catches: the
     biography of a white Indian agent contains the word `Indian` too. Charles Jouett,
     John Tipton, Daniel W. Beckwith and the 1843 directory's two advertisers reach R6
     that way. This stage mints only where the SOURCE'S OWN STRUCTURE says it — a company
     column reading `INDIAN` is a field the clerk filled in about this man; a paragraph
     that mentions Indians is not. Every other row is withheld with the reason named, and
     the count of them is a finding about the roster's rule rather than about the people.

  3. NO NATION IS WRITTEN. The roll heads the company `INDIAN` and says no more. The
     Potawatomi, the Ottawa and the Ojibwe of this country were three nations and a united
     band of them lived at the forks; the roll distinguishes none of them, so neither does
     this stage. `community` is `native`, which is this vocabulary's word for *the source
     says Indian and says nothing further*, and a card that later reaches a nation replaces
     it. Writing `potawatomi` on ninety-odd men because most of the country's people were
     Potawatomi would be inventing the one fact the record withholds.

WHAT IS NOT DONE HERE, AND IT IS THE LARGER HALF. The roll is a roll of enrolled MEN.
It counts no woman and no child, and this corpus holds no roll, census or annuity schedule
that counts the Native and Metis people at Chicago on 1 July 1835 at all. The bracket in
`the_counted_but_unnamed` states that in figures and refuses to draw a remainder out of a
count that does not exist — the same refusal T-1353 made for the crews of the vessels, for
the same reason. The August 1835 gathering is not a source for a July scene and is not
staged; AGENTS.md's standing constraint governs, and no figure is drawn for anybody (L1).

NOTHING HERE OVERTURNS A REFUSAL. The ledger refused every one of these rows as a person
unit and its reasoning is carried onto each card verbatim. A card written here is a
reconstruction of what the town looks like if the name is admitted at the limit of its own
evidence, and it says so on its face, exactly as a re-admission does.
