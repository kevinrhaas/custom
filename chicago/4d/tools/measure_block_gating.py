"""Why a platted block the grid refuses is refused: short of control, or never a block.

T-0183 added a third answer this gate reads but does not itself measure — a block whose
streets DO meet, whose access IS dry, and whose ground still cannot carry a lot because the
South Branch takes its depth. It is expected to measure dry here, and the refusal that
holds it is `tools/generate_plat_lots.py`'s crossed-rows rule.

T-0163. `tools/generate_plat_lots.py` builds the platted grid as the CARTESIAN PRODUCT of
the committed east-west rows and north-south columns, and refuses any pairing whose four
centrelines do not meet. It reports each refusal as a distance — "South Water Street's
committed centreline stops 878 m short of this block" — and `tools/reconcile_665.py` then
re-admits two of those refusals as `platted_block_awaiting_street_control`, carrying 27
roofs of headroom each against street control ROADMAP S9 records as owed.

A DISTANCE CANNOT TELL THOSE TWO CASES APART, and they are not the same case:

  * a corner whose two streets genuinely met, whose centreline simply has not been carried
    that far yet — real ground, waiting on a trace; and
  * a pairing of two streets that never met at all, which no trace will ever join, because
    the row does not run that far and never did.

The second is not gated. It is an artifact of the product, and counting its roofs as
headroom promises ground that street control cannot deliver.

THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE COMMITTED HEIGHTFIELD, NOT AN OPINION. A street's centreline is
carried toward the block it is supposed to bound, and the straight run between them is
sampled against the committed ground: if that run crosses water, the two are on opposite
banks and the pairing is a product artifact — a row on the south bank cannot bound a block
on the west side of the South Branch, whatever a trace does. If the run stays dry, the gap
is ordinary unfinished control and the block is really waiting.

Water is read the way the plat generator itself reads it (`generate_plat_lots.py`): a
sample is wet where the field does not cover it, or covers it below the datum surface.

    tools/measure_block_gating.py            the report
    tools/measure_block_gating.py --check    fail if a refusal's class has moved

Exit 0 pass, 1 on a classification that disagrees with the committed programme, 2 if the
inputs cannot be read.
