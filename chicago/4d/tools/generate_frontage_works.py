"""Generate the town's frontage works — the plank walks, the board crossings, the
hitching posts and the named boards on posts that stand between a building and the
street it fronts on.

WHAT THIS IS. Ticket **T-0082** wrote it for the Green Tree Tavern, the third of the four
pieces T-0042 (*image-accuracy pass: the Green Tree Tavern*) was split into, and ticket
**T-0090** made it a town rule by adding the second building. The owner's reference views
of both houses describe the ground in front of them, and none of it is furniture standing
in a yard — it is the STREET side of the building:

  * image 6, the Braunhold engraving of the Green Tree, 1838: *"post-mounted hanging
    signboard at the corner; plank sidewalks with board crossings"*;
  * image 7, the Trowbridge drawing of the Green Tree: *"the hanging 'GREEN TREE' sign on
    its post"*, and a dirt road with grass verges;
  * image 8, the Petford watercolour of the Sauganash, 1831: *"plank sidewalk with a board
    crossing over the road; two posts (hitching/corner posts) at the road edge"*;
  * image 9, the Braunhold engraving of the Sauganash: *"plank walks on both frontages,
    hitching posts"*;
  * image 10, the Trowbridge drawing of the Sauganash, which stands a saddled horse at one
    of those posts — L1 reference only, and never depicted.

All are read from `data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md`, which is the
written record of eleven owner-supplied reference images. They are **tier 5 pictorial**:
they may drive massing, materials, furniture and setting, and they may never drive a
coordinate. So WHAT stands here comes from the plates and WHERE is derived from the
committed footprint, the committed placement and the committed street corridor — the
same division `tools/generate_yard_goods.py` keeps for the same buildings' yards.

WHY IT IS A LAYER OF ITS OWN rather than more yard goods. A barrel or a wagon stands on
a building's own ground and is derived from its walls alone. A walk and a crossing stand
in the STREET, and the number that decides where they may lie is the street's — the
travelled track's own half-width out of `data/streets/1835.json`. These records are the
first things in the project derived from a building and a street at once, and tickets
T-0066 (a board carrying its location's name) and T-0069 (fences and plank sidewalks
along the streets) are the town-wide standards they set two buildings at a time.

**ONE RULE, A TABLE OF BUILDINGS.** T-0082 wrote "the second and the twentieth cost
nothing but a line here", and T-0090 spent that line: `BUILDINGS` below is the whole
difference between the two records this writes. What is per-building is the PROSE — which
plate says what, and what the plate shows — and two switches the plates decide:

  * `sign`: a named board on a post at the corner, which the Green Tree's plates show and
    the Sauganash's do not. A building with no `sign` keeps the blank wall board
    `tools/generate_business_signboards.py` hangs on it by rule (docs/LIBERTIES.md L130).
  * `hitching`: posts at the road edge, which the Sauganash's plates show and the Green
    Tree's do not — its plates put a wagon shed and a bench there instead (L134).

Nothing else differs. Every dimension, every clearance and every refusal below is the same
rule at both buildings, and `--check` re-derives both records byte for byte.

THE LETTERING, and it is the one decision in this parcel that needed arguing rather
than deriving. `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L25 decided that the town's one documented sign — the
Wolf Point Tavern's painted wolf — is drawn as a blank board, because no description of
the painting survives, and L130 applied that to all twenty-four boards the signage layer
hangs. **That reasoning does not reach the Green Tree's board.** L25's subject is an IMAGE
nobody has described; that board's subject is a NAME, the plate states it in as many
words, and the name is already in this repository as
`data/structures/green_tree_tavern.json` `name`. Refusing to letter it would not be
caution, it would be discarding evidence the project holds — which is precisely the
reading AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER exists to refuse. So that board carries GREEN
TREE, the wording is graded `inferred` against the plate, and what stays invented is the
LETTERFORM: the face, the size, the spacing and the colour, none of which any source
gives. That split is L135. **The Sauganash gets no lettering**, and not because the rule
is being rationed: none of its three views shows a name board at all.

THE WALL BOARD THIS REPLACES. `tools/generate_business_signboards.py` hangs a blank
board on the Green Tree's front wall by rule (L130). The plates show ONE board at that
inn and it is on a post at the corner, so that generator now refuses this frontage in
writing rather than the town drawing the same claim twice. The Sauganash's plates show no
board at all, so its wall board stands and that generator is not touched.

#   NOT the third (leave it and say so): a board under a dock is not something a

# THE TOWN'S STREET EDGE (T-0069). The owner, of the first Cook County jail
# engraving: "note the fences lining the street and what appears to be plank
# sidewalks. all of the streets should be updated like this... at least south of
# the river or near the river." Four plates in the same brief agree — image 1
# (the jail: board fences at the frontage line with a plank walk at their foot),
# images 8 and 9 (the Sauganash: plank walks on BOTH frontages with board
# crossings over the road) and image 6 (the Green Tree: plank walks and
# crossings). Those are the same two treatments this generator already writes at
# two buildings; what T-0069 adds is that they stop being a building's frontage
# and become the STREET'S EDGE, laid from the platted grid rather than from a
# wall.
#
# WHY THE PLAT AND NOT THE SIDECARS. A walk "at the lot line" needs a lot line,
# and this project has one: `data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json`, whose every
# block edge IS a committed street centreline offset by half the committed 80 ft
# corridor (its own `_doc` says so, and tools/generate_plat_lots.py re-derives it
# on every commit). So the treatment comes off the street network by
# construction: move a centreline and every walk below moves with it. Nothing
# here is hand-placed on one block.
#
# THE BOUNDARY DRAWN, and it is the ticket's own words: the two streets that run
# ALONG the river's south bank — SOUTH WATER STREET, which IS the bank, and LAKE
# STREET one block behind it — through the platted blocks between Market Street
# and State Street. Both frontages of Lake, and the one frontage South Water has
# (its north side is the river bank, wharves and landings, not a platted block).
# That is "at least south of the river or near the river", and it is the town's
# whole trading core in 1835.
#
# RANDOLPH STREET WAS BUILT, MEASURED, TAKEN BACK OUT, AND IS NOW BACK IN
# (T-0127/T-0188, then T-0240). It is the widest frontage the platted grid holds —
# 14 block faces against Lake's 12, Washington's 7 and South Water's 5 — and
# through this same rule it lays 13 of them: the record's own `rule` block goes
# from 16 faces to 29, 1,297.3 m of walk to 2,468.3, 11 board crossings to 25,
# 11 street fence runs to 26 (494.4 m to 1,345.6), and 96 walking decks to 190.
# One Randolph face is refused rather than laid, and the record's `refused`
# names it. The history is kept here
# because it is the only thing that answers "why is this tuple the length it is"
# for the next run, and because WHAT CHANGED was not the street.
#
# WHEN IT WAS REFUSED (T-0188), at the T-0135 stand set on the published mirror,
# desktop 1280x800, at the axial stand (Lake Street at Canal, east):
#
#   full      1,378,984 -> 1,497,588 of 1,400,000   (+118,604; 97,588 OVER)
#   balanced  1,205,762 -> 1,355,638 of 1,210,000   (+149,876; 145,638 OVER)
#   light       812,753 ->   869,731 of 1,050,000   (inside, 180,269 spare)
#
# — mobile 390x780 the same shape. The lever T-0115 costed for this parcel had
# already been taken and was not enough: the ground-hugging boards do not cast
# into the shadow map (see `frontage.js` `standingChunk` and `main.js`
# `applyShadowTier`), and turning OFF the layer's five remaining shadow casters
# read 44,110 triangles against a 145,638 shortfall. The ledger's own conclusion
# was that THE BINDING FACT WAS NOT RANDOLPH: `balanced` stood at 1,205,762 of
# 1,210,000 BEFORE the parcel — 0.35 % — so no street tier fitted until that was
# addressed.
#
# IT WAS ADDRESSED, AND BY THE TICKET THAT LEDGER POINTED AT. T-0223 found the
# sun drawing 180,100 triangles of timber lying outside the +/-240 m shadow box —
# 14.4 % of the frame, casting nothing the shadow map can hold — and culled it.
# The worst stand fell from 1,412,120 to 1,252,519 at `full` and 1,252,802 to
# 1,083,932 at `balanced`. That is the headroom this street was refused for, and
# it was never Randolph's to give back.
#
# RE-MEASURED FOR T-0240 on the published mirror with
# `tools/measure_detail_ceilings.mjs`, worst of T-0135's five stands, BOTH
# viewports — not the axial stand alone, because with this street laid the worst
# stand at two of the three tiers moves to the forks:
#
#                 desktop 1280x800            mobile 390x780        ORIGINAL
#   full      1,369,835 of 1,425,000      1,272,801 of 1,425,000   1,400,000
#   balanced  1,201,248 of 1,260,000      1,148,172 of 1,260,000   1,210,000
#   light       745,904 of 1,050,000        695,030 of 1,050,000   1,050,000
#
#   draw calls, worst stand: 155 desktop, 146 mobile, of 215.
#
# Every tier is inside its ceiling at every stand at both viewports, and — the
# clause that matters, because T-0229 exists to take the raise back out — every
# tier is also inside the ORIGINAL 1,400,000 / 1,210,000 / 1,050,000. `balanced`
# clears the original by 8,752. So this street does NOT depend on the temporary
# raise and does not have to be unwound with it.
#
# WASHINGTON IS HERE NOW (T-0241), AND WHAT LET IT IN WAS A TRIM AND NOT A
# CEILING. It is worth keeping the refusal beside the admission, because the two
# readings are a day apart and the street did not change between them.
#
# WHEN IT WAS REFUSED, one run ago (T-0240): both streets were generated together
# — 36 faces, 3,129.1 m of walk — and measured against the ceilings as they stood
# that hour, which were the raised ones T-0229 was about to give back:
#
#   full      1,385,207 of 1,425,000   PASS by 39,793
#   balanced  1,260,174 of 1,260,000   OVER BY 174
#   light       761,404 of 1,050,000   PASS
#
# THE 174 WAS NEVER THE REAL NUMBER. T-0229 landed before that reading shipped
# and put `balanced` back to its original 1,210,000, so re-measured on dev with
# Washington laid the shortfall was **49,442**, not 174 — 1,259,442 of 1,210,000
# at the axial stand, with `full` clear by 14,613 and `light` by 23,440. A run
# quoting the earlier figure would have gone looking for a hundred and seventy
# triangles and found fifty thousand.
#
# WHAT PAID FOR IT. `balanced` was the only rung of the scene-detail ladder with
# NO furniture reach at all: it drew every plank walk, fence, barrel, wharf deck
# and moored hull in Chicago at any distance, exactly as `full` does, while
# `light` had been distance-culling since T-0150. Giving it 800 m gives back
# 68,772 triangles at the worst stand for a 48^2 frame signature that does not
# move by a single count at any of the five stands at either viewport. The whole
# reading is at `FURNITURE_REACH_BALANCED_M` in `renderers/web/js/main.js`, and
# not one ceiling in `DETAIL` moved.
#
# The cross streets' own frontages (T-0192) and the West Division across the
# South Branch (T-0193) likewise stay out, and the record's own `refused` carries
# every one of these numbers rather than a promise.
EDGE_STREETS = ("south_water", "lake", "randolph", "washington")
#
# THE WEST DIVISION WAS BUILT AND MEASURED RATHER THAN ESTIMATED (T-0193), and it
# is refused by ONE STAND AT ONE TIER AT ONE VIEWPORT. `blk_lake_clinton` is the
# last platted block this rule never looked at; T-0069 refused it as "one stranded
# block" and T-0127 promised it to a follow-up without a number. Here is the
# number. Both its faces were generated — the Lake face T-0069 named, and the
# Randolph face that only became coverable when T-0240 put Randolph in
# `EDGE_STREETS` the day before — giving +2 faces, +192.2 m of walk, +1 crossing
# and +3 street-lining fences. Published and read with
# `tools/measure_detail_ceilings.mjs` at T-0135's five stands, both viewports,

#
# The whole cost lands at ONE stand — `lake_at_canal`, which stands at this
# block's own east end and looks east down the axis where nothing culls. There
# the block costs +27,932 triangles; at the other four stands it costs a flat
# +8,460, and mobile clears `balanced` by 34,712.
#
# HALF OF IT DOES NOT FIT EITHER, WHICH IS THE FINDING. The Lake face ALONE —
# exactly what T-0069 refused, with the Randolph face held back — costs +23,712 at
# that stand and reads 1,223,890, still OVER by 13,890. So this is not a block
# that is too big: `balanced` stood 1,201,344 of 1,210,000 on `dev` BEFORE this
# ticket, 8,656 triangles and 0.7 % of headroom, and no street frontage of any
# size fits under it today. That is the same binding fact T-0240 recorded for
# Washington one rung earlier, and it is why T-0193 is blocked on T-0190 rather
# than bought with a sixth ceiling raise — which T-0237's acceptance refuses in

# THE HITCHING POSTS AT THE TRADING FRONTAGES (T-0194). T-0069 allowed them to
# ride along and T-0127 kept them back to hold that parcel to one demonstration:
# *"the rule would put them in the verge outside the walk at the trading
# frontages."* This is that rule, and it invents no post and no place to put one
# — both already exist. The Sauganash's two posts (T-0090, docs/LIBERTIES.md
# L136) stand HITCH_VERGE_M beyond the outer edge of its own front walk, at the
# thirds of the frontage, and are drawn from the plates that show a saddled horse
# tied to one. What is new here is only WHICH OTHER FRONTAGES get one, and that
# question is answered by a table this repository already argues.
#
# THE RULE, and each clause is doing work.
#
#   1. A COMMITTED BUILDING STANDS ON THE LOT. Clause 2 of the fence rule above,
#      for the same reason: an unimproved lot is prairie and nobody tied a horse
#      to prairie.
#   2. ITS TRADE TAKES ITS CUSTOM OFF THE STREET — `function.value` is one of
#      `generate_business_signboards.PUBLIC_TRADES`, the set that file defines as
#      "trades whose customer was a stranger off the street". It is IMPORTED
#      rather than restated so the two layers cannot drift. A WORKS OR WAREHOUSE
#      trade is refused in writing: a tannery, a packing house and a brickyard
#      took carts and drays at a yard gate, which is a different fitting from a
#      post a rider ties a bridle to, and that distinction is the one the
#      signboard rule already draws between a board over a footway and a name
#      painted on a front. A dwelling gets nothing at all.
#   3. THE TRADE IS HELD ON EVIDENCE — `attested`, `documented` or `inferred`,
#      which is clause 3 of the signboard rule verbatim. This is what keeps posts
#      off the anonymous slots: an `inf_` roof's trade was DEALT BY A SCHEDULE,
#      and standing a hitching post at it would be furniture resting on an
#      invention resting on a rule. Note that the signboard rule's OTHER
#      exclusion — an anonymous slot has no name to paint — does NOT apply here
#      and is deliberately not copied: a post carries no lettering. The clause
#      that bites is the trade's grade, not its anonymity.
#   4. THE WALK WAS ACTUALLY LAID IN FRONT OF IT. A post stands in the verge
#      OUTSIDE a walk, so where the march refused the boards there is no verge to
#      measure from and no walk to stand beside. This also means every post
#      inherits the march's own audit of the ground it fronts.
#   5. ITS OWN STAND HOLDS IT — dry committed ground, nothing committed already
#      standing on it, and EDGE_TRACK_MARGIN_M still between its outer face and
#      the street's travelled track. A post in the roadway is the one thing this
#      layer has refused since T-0082, and a post is audited for it separately
#      from the walk because it stands most of a metre further out.
#
# WHERE IT STANDS is the building's own frontage and not the lot's: two trades
# can share one platted lot on these streets (the Sauganash and Philo
# Carpenter's shop do), and a post at a fraction of the LOT would put both of
# them in the same hole. So the footprint is projected onto the face it fronts
# and the post stands at EDGE_HITCH_ALONG of that span — the same fraction, off
# the corner and off the door, that HITCH_ALONG's first post uses at the inns.
EDGE_HITCH_ALONG = HITCH_ALONG[0]
# Out from the lot line: past the walk's outer edge, then the same verge the
# sign post and the inns' own hitching posts stand in.
EDGE_HITCH_OFFSET_M = EDGE_OFFSET_M + WALK_W_M / 2.0 + HITCH_VERGE_M

# THE SOUTH WATER PLACEMENTS (T-0127), NAMED HERE BECAUSE THE RECORD IS WHERE A
# READER MEETS THEM. Eleven documented buildings on South Water Street's south
# side were placed in August 2026 by reading the MODERN West Wacker Drive
# centreline out of OpenStreetMap and stepping half a platted street south of it
# — each record says so in its own `position.note`, and several already warn that
# "modern Wacker Drive is not exactly the 1835 South Water Street line". Measured
# against this project's OWN committed line they stood 4.51 to 8.17 m out past
# the platted frontage, in the roadway, and the march below refused the sidewalk
# around every one of them.
#
# ALL ELEVEN ARE NOW RECONCILED and every one of their walls stands 1.50 m back
# from the committed frontage line, the same margin `tools/generate_block_infill.py`
# gives every reconstructed unit on these faces. It took two runs and one ruling.
# T-0198 moved SIX; the other five it refused in writing, per store, because
# reconciled onto the plat a building SEATS on a platted lot and for those five the
# lot was one the 665-roof schedule had already dealt to this street's anonymous
# frontage run — nothing overlapped, and what refused them was the rule "one
# principal roof to a lot" rather than the ground. **The owner ruled on 2026-08-27
# that a business-front lot may carry a documented store at the street AND an
# anonymous dwelling behind it** (T-0199; `tools/plat_occupancy.py` carries the
# ruling and the clause), so the last five came onto the plat too and this record's
# march stopped refusing a single step for a wall anywhere on South Water Street.
# The number beside each is the metres it moved along its face's inward normal.

    landing — the deck and its stair, named apart so an audit can say which.

    THE STAIR IS DERIVED, NOT ASSUMED, because the renderer derives it: how far
    it reaches inland is how many treads the rise takes, and the rise is the
    terrain's answer at each site. So this walks the same fixed point

    heightfield as committed that is one or two treads, 0.75 m or 1.50 m of
    reach; `STAIR_MAX_TREADS` is the renderer's own refusal to build more, and a

# looking west at 277 degrees on 2026-08-21: the La Salle drain should be "a
# continous water drain into the river and have plank crossings for both the
# road and the sidewalk". The drain was carried through to the river in the same
# ticket and `lasalle_slough_crossing` is the timber crossing that answers the
# first half; this is the second — six feet of plank laid along the deck's north
# edge, outside the wagon way, on the machinery T-0119 built for the footway over
# the State Street slough's mouth. Nothing here is authored: every figure is read
# off the crossing's own committed sidecar.

# plank rides the committed deck or the land, by asking which is HIGHER: over the
# State slough the approaches are CUTS and the banks stand above that low deck, so
# a board laid past the abutment takes the ground and its stringers reach it. Here
# they are FILLS graded UP to a deck that stands over its banks, so the ground is
# below the deck for as far as the fill runs and every board past the abutment
# would go on riding the deck — 0.27 m of daylight under it, no stringers, which
# is what the smoke's "the plank decks tie into the ground they cross" reads. So
# the boards stop where the deck does and the fill's own crest carries the last
# stride, 0.13 m below the plank line.
