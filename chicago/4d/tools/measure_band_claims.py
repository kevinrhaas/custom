"""Is the invention actually bounded by the specification it cites?

ROADMAP K25. Every invented form value on every reconstructed building carries the
same closing sentence — *"Type-level choice within the D3 band in the reconstruction
specification"* — and that sentence is the **entire defence for the invention**: the
building is made up, but it is made up inside what the specification allows. It is a
provenance claim, so where the value is outside the band it cites, the note is not
merely imprecise. It is **wrong about its own source**.

`tools/measure_massing_variety.py` (T-V1) asked a neighbouring question of the
anonymous layer only — is the town a distribution or one building stamped out — and
counted 40 eaves outside their band on the way past. This tool asks K25's question of
**every reconstructed record in the dataset and every form value the crosswalk authors
a machine-readable band for**: footprint, eave, roof pitch, storeys-and-loft, roof
form. Both layers, 249 records.

## The root cause, and it is one line

`inferred_form()` in `tools/generate_inferred_households.py` — and the anonymous
generators alongside it — select every form value from the **archetype**, consulting
the family only for a handful of named special cases:

    wall = 3.42 if door == "wagon" else (2.75 if door == "stable" else 2.05)
    ...
    "roof_pitch_deg": a(18.0 if roof == "shed" else 32.0),

The note attached to that value cites the **family**. So `outbuilding` hands out a
2.05 m wall whether the family band asks for 7-8 ft (D2, a hair under) or 9-18 ft (W4,
out by a third of the band's floor), and every archetype constant lands on a dozen
families at once. That is why the offenders come in bands of identical values rather
than scattered: 6.73 ft appears on D2, A5 and W4 alike because it is 2.05 m, and
2.05 m is what the outbuilding archetype builds.

## What it gates, and what it only reports

**The gate is a ratchet against a committed census**, `tools/band_claims_baseline.json`,
which holds every offending (record, field) pair with its value and its band. The
strict assertion — no value outside the band its note cites — **fails today**, by
design and on purpose: `--strict` runs it and exits non-zero with the numbers. It is
not what `check.sh` runs, because the fault cannot be repaired on the improve runner
(see below) and a permanently red dev gate would block every unrelated parcel behind
it. What `check.sh` runs is the ratchet: a **new** value outside its band, or a
committed offender whose value moved, is a failure. The fault may shrink and may not
grow, and K25(b) shrinks it to zero and deletes the baseline.

## What it measures, today

    1135 values tested against a machine-readable band, 98 outside it,
    on 80 of the 249 records:

    field       tested  outside  near the edge
    eave           249       54             46
    pitch          207       38             38
    levels         181        4              1
    footprint      249        2              0
    roof_type      249        0              0

**Widening a band is not a repair, and the tolerance here is not a policy choice.**
The bands are the specification's, not this project's, and a band widened to admit the
value it was supposed to bound stops being evidence. The only slack allowed is
`EPS_FT` — 1.5 mm, which is the round-trip through the committed metre value and
nothing else, since every dimension in `data/` is stored in metres to the millimetre
and every band edge is a whole foot. Five footprints sat half a millimetre over an
edge at a tighter epsilon and every one of them is an exact 42 ft or 18 ft in the
source; those are not findings and are not counted.

**K25's open question — what to do about the cases within a hair of the edge — is
decided here: they are failures, counted separately and forgiven nowhere.** 46 of the
54 eaves are within a foot and 38 of 38 pitches are within one 1:12 step, and that
nearness is the *diagnosis*, not a defence. `2.78 m` is 37 mm over the top of D3's
8-9 ft band because the frame-dwelling archetype builds 2.78 m walls, not because
anybody measured a cottage; `18.0 deg` is 0.10 of a step under D2's 4:12 floor because
the generator authors whole degrees while the crosswalk authors rise:run. A tolerance
wide enough to forgive either is wide enough to forgive a third of a D3's band, and it
would forgive exactly the fault this parcel exists to name.

**The unspoken-field census is reported and not gated.** The same sentence is attached
to values the crosswalk authors nothing about — `board_gap_m` on 99 records against a
specification that names no board gap anywhere, `paint` on 227 against 4 families that
mention paint at all. A note citing a band that does not speak to the value is a
different fault from a value outside its band, and a cruder instrument finds it (a
keyword over the family's authored geometry strings), so it is printed rather than
asserted. It is the second half of K25's subject and it wants its own parcel.

## Why (b) cannot follow (a) here

Every offender is on a parcel whose meshes are canonical Blender bakes. Changing a
committed dimension stales the GLB, `validate.py --all` fails a stale GLB, that
validator IS the dev gate, there is no Blender on the improve runner, and
`chicago-4d-bake.yml` bakes from `dev`. The repair cannot pass the gate it must pass
to reach the branch the bake reads. T-V1(b) hit the identical circle and wrote it up;
its three routes are K25(b)'s routes too.
