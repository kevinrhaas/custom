# `census_1840` — the 1840 federal census of Chicago, read off the page images

**This is LATER EVIDENCE.** Nothing in this directory mints an 1835 resident. The
project's ratified ladder is explicit: *1839/1840 alone is never a 1835 resident.*
What is read here is a named 1840 household head with a line position; the bridge to
1835 is a separate, adjudicated step (T-0505), and the minting is a separate one again
(T-0514, T-0515).

## What the deposit holds

`chicago/reference/census1840/` holds 75 distinct FamilySearch page images (76 files —
`33S7-9YYJ-9WF (1).jpg` is a byte-identical copy of `33S7-9YYJ-9WF.jpg`). The deposit is
**read only**: no image, crop or render is ever committed. Only derived text is.

The sheets come in two kinds and both are numbered in the same run of printed pages:

| kind | what it carries |
|---|---|
| **left sheet** | `NAMES OF HEADS OF FAMILIES`, then 13 free-white male and 13 free-white female age bands, then free coloured males and females |
| **right sheet** | the continuation: slaves, the family TOTAL, the six industry columns, pensioners, deaf/dumb/blind, and schools & illiteracy |

A household is one ruled line spanning both, so a name and its own household figures
live on two different images.

## What is in here

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `coverage.json` | exactly which images have been looked at, what each one is, and what has and has not been read from it. A hole is meant to FAIL rather than pass quietly. |
| `pages/<familysearch_id>.json` | one file per page read: the printed page number, the sheet side, and one record per ruled line — `line`, `as_read`, `normalized`, `name_confidence`, `reading`. |
| `crosswalk_670.json` | the line-by-line comparison against the 210 rows PR #670 recovered from the owner's lost v4 workbook. |

## The reading rules

- **`as_read` is a POSITION-PRESERVING reading.** An unread letter is `[?]` — a position,
  not an absence (T-0397). `normalized` is the modern spelling this project would use;
  where the surname itself is unread, `normalized` keeps the `[?]` rather than inventing a
  name that scans well.
- **`name_confidence` is `high | medium | low`** and is about the LETTERS, not about who
  the person was. A name can be read with confidence and still belong to nobody this
  project can identify.
- **`reading: scan_verified`** means it was read off the deposited page image. It is the
  senior reading: where a transcription and the sheet disagree, the sheet wins and both
  are kept.
- **Enumeration order is data.** The line sequence is the only spatial signal the 1840
  census carries — households were visited in walking order — so lines are never
  reordered and a blank or illegible line is recorded, never skipped.
- **No IPUMS serial is attached here.** The serial mapping is by age-band fingerprint and
  is T-0504's job, over all three image groups at once.

## The finding this pass exists to record

PR #670 recovered 210 named household heads from the owner's v4 workbook, which he has
since ruled lost — "They are lost; rebuild". Those 210 rows are the calibration set any
new reading must reproduce before it extends. **Two of the seven pages they cover are in
this group (printed 230 and 232), and read off the sheets they do not reproduce.**

Of 62 lines compared, **10 agree on both given name and surname** and **33 agree on
neither**. Some of the disagreements are large: line 17 of page 232 reads *Gurdon S.
Hubbard* on the sheet against *Saml. J. McCord?* in #670, and line 25 reads *John H.
Kinzie* against *John W. Rogers?* — two of the most consequential names in the town.
Page 230's tail shows a different shape again: several #670 rows match the scan one line
LATER, which is what a row drift looks like rather than a bad reading.

`crosswalk_670.json` carries every line of it. **Nothing in #670 was overwritten** — both
readings stand, with the reason the scan is treated as senior stated on each line. What
this means for T-0504 and T-0505 is that the 210 rows cannot be used as ground truth for
a serial fingerprint or an identity bridge until they have been re-read against the
images; that is the whole point of reading the calibration pages first.

## What has NOT been read yet, and where it is

The age-band, free-coloured and industry cells are a column-by-column reading that has to
be checked against the **printed column totals at the foot of each sheet** before it can
be committed — 26 narrow columns of single strokes, where a mark one column off is a
person of the wrong age. Committing a half-checked row would be worse than leaving it
unread, so every `records[].cells` here is `null` with `cells_state: "not_read"`, and the
cells are their own ticket. The other 23 images of this group are inventoried in
`coverage.json` — kind, printed page, line count — and transcribed by the sibling tickets
T-0495 was split into.
