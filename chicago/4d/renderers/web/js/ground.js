/**
 * ground.js — what the ground claims, in the walkthrough.
 *
 * Every building in this scene can tell you what it asserts, how sure we are of
 * it, which sources say so, and where the record is weakest. The surface all of
 * them stand on could tell you none of that, and it is not because the ground
 * had nothing to say: `data/terrain/epochs/<e>/terrain_spec.json` grades itself
 * as carefully as any structure record. A documented water plane. Three inferred
 * division levels argued out of period narrative feet. A conjectural bank face
 * that is the largest unsourced assumption in the build, and a channel
 * cross-section whose own note says it carries no evidence at all.
 *
 * None of it reached a visitor. The ground even DITHERS under the confidence
 * view — the terrain mesh carries the same `_CONFIDENCE` channel a building
 * does — so the walkthrough has been showing that a grade exists while saying
 * nothing about what was graded, which is the least useful half of the claim.
 *
 * Derived, never authored here: `tools/compile_scene.py` reads the spec and the
 * generated heightfield and writes `sidecars/<scene>/terrain.json`, and
 * `tools/check.sh` re-derives it, so this section cannot fall behind the spec it
 * is quoting. `tools/validate.py` holds those claims to the same citation rule a
 * record answers to — which nothing did while the file was read only by the
 * generator.
 *
 * Nothing here composes a display value. A claim's figures are the spec's own
 * numbers under the spec's own key names; its reasoning is the spec's note,
 * verbatim; and a claim with no reasoning recorded says exactly that, because
 * three of them have none and a section that quietly rendered a blank would be
 * hiding the one thing this panel exists to show.
