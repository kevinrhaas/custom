/**
 * people.js — the People section of the drawer: a directory of everyone in the town.
 *
 * The household browser (`residents.js`) is organised the way the DATA is —
 * 1,380 household records, a letter-list cohort held apart, a vocabulary, the
 * researched-and-not-resident list — and it is the right shape for reading the
 * research. It is the wrong shape for the question a visitor actually walks in
 * with, which is a name. "Was there a Beaubien?" is a directory question, and a
 * directory is one row a PERSON, sorted by surname, that narrows as you type.
 *
 * So this reads `sidecars/<scene>/people.json`, which `tools/compile_scene.py
 * compile_people` flattens from the household records — one row a person, with
 * the fields a list needs to sort, filter and label and a pointer at the record
 * it came from. The record itself is fetched the first time a person's card is
 * opened and rendered with `householdHtml` from residents.js, the same function
 * the household browser uses: two sections, one rendering of a record, so a card
 * cannot say something its record does not.
 *
 * WHAT THE FILTERS ARE FOR. The owner's ruling of 30 August 2026 let every name
 * on a post-office letter list into the town, and 727 of these 1,404 people are
 * a name on such a list and nothing else — no trade, no street, no household.
 * A directory that mixed them in silently would be *"a wall of undifferentiated
 * people"*, which the ruling said would mean it had been implemented badly. So
 * the "How known" row is the first thing a visitor can narrow by, every row of
 * the list carries a mark saying which kind of person it is, and the counts on
 * the pills say how much of the town each kind is before anything is tapped.
 * The counts are read off the compiled rows, never typed.
 *
 * Nothing here is virtualised. 1,404 rows at 44 px is a list a browser paints
 * without complaint, but a drawer 440 px wide does not want 62,000 px of it, so
 * the list renders in pages of 80 with a "Show 80 more" button — cheaper than a
 * scroll listener and honest about how many are left.
 *
 * Contract (main.js): `mountPeople({ mount, people, registry, dataBase, sceneId,
 * onGoTo, problems })` → `{ people, error, search, open, close, filter, state }`.
 * `mount` is `#people-directory`, the first child of the People section; the
 * household browser's mounts (`#residents-note`, `#residents`) sit below it
 * untouched, under "Browse by household".

 * The row used to be `slice(0, 10)` over the whole layer's trade counts, which
 * was a fair cut while the layer was the 457 residents the sources name. The
 * reconstruction changed what that sentence counts: T-1347 drew 308 trade heads
 * and T-1353 minted the summer's visitors, and the ten commonest trades became
 * almost entirely that draw — 57 domestics, 38 boarding-house keepers, 26
 * labourers, 26 clerks. `tavern_keeper` fell to rank 78 of 83 and had no pill at
 * all, so the directory could not be asked for this town's tavern keepers, its
 * physicians or its lawyers: the trades a reader actually looks for were exactly
 * the ones the reconstruction buried, and they are the ones this project can
 * name people in.
 *
 * So the offer is cut from TWO rankings rather than one, and the evidence goes
 * first:
 *   - the eight commonest trades counted over the people the layer's evidence
 *     carries — grade `attested` or `inferred`, which is every person read off a
 *     source rather than minted to fill a model;
 *   - the six commonest trades of the town as a whole, so the numerous
 *     reconstructed groups (domestics, boarding-house keepers, labourers,
 *     clerks) keep a pill of their own.
 *
 * Deduped, evidenced first, so a reconstruction pass can ADD a pill and can
 * never take away one the sources attest — which is the property the bare count
 * cut did not have. Counting the two rankings separately is also why no
 * threshold has to be invented: neither list is a judgement about how many
 * people a trade needs, only about which trades the two populations are
 * commonest in. The whole vocabulary stays reachable in `more trades…`.
