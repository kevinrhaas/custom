/**
 * businesses.js — the Businesses section of the drawer: every firm the town's
 * record knows, findable.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The renderer never opened `register_1835.json` or the
 * business layer at all: a firm reached a visitor only through a building
 * card's "Use"/"Keepers" lines, a signboard tap, or the agencies panel. That
 * works for the 30 houses that stand in a roof of their own, and it leaves the
 * other 166 — 26 placed against a landmark and no closer, 61 known to a street
 * and no further, 79 the register could place nowhere at all — invisible in a
 * walk of the town. They are not
 * lesser evidence. A printed advertisement with no address is still a house
 * that traded here, and the one thing it must never become is a building
 * invented to carry it. So it gets a card instead of a roof.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS. `data/businesses/index.json`, which `tools/compile_businesses.py`
 * derives from the register, the gazetteer and the resident layer — one row a
 * firm, carrying what a list needs to sort, filter, count and search. The record
 * itself is fetched the first time a card is opened, the way `people.js` fetches
 * a household: the list is 196 rows and must paint at once; a card is one file.
 *
 * THE GRADE ON A ROW is the FIRM's, and a firm states its tiers in three places
 * — who ran it, where it stood, when it opened. `compile_businesses.record_grade`
 * folds those into one: attested where any of them is attested, reconstructed
 * where every one of them is, inferred otherwise. The card prints all three
 * separately, so the fold can always be unpicked.
 *
 * THE PLACE FILTER is the point of the view. `premises` is a roof of its own,
 * `anchored` is "next door to the Sauganash" and no roof, `street_only` is a
 * street and no more, `unplaceable` is a house the register could not put
 * anywhere — and every one of those says, in the record's own words, WHY it
 * stops there. A visitor can ask for the unplaceable ones and read 79 limits.
 *
 * It files a firm ONCE, under its primary location, so the tally it counts by is
 * `counts.by_where_kind` (firms) and never `counts.by_location_kind` (locations).
 * Four of these houses moved inside the window and carry two addresses; a firm
 * filed under the street it ended on still holds the unplaceable one it left.
 *
 * Contract (main.js): `mountBusinesses({ mount, index, registry, dataBase,
 * onGoTo, onPerson, onTitle, problems })` -> `{ businesses, error, search,
 * open, close, filter, results, state }`.

/**
 * THE CROSSWALK, BOTH WAYS — the index folded once so the three places a visitor
 * ALREADY IS can reach a firm's card without opening the directory at all.
 *
 * The directory is the way in for somebody who came looking for a firm. It is
 * the wrong way in for the visitor standing under a board, reading a building's
 * card, or reading the card of the man who kept the place: they are already at
 * the firm and the town made them go and find it by name. So the same two
 * questions — WHICH FIRMS DOES THIS PERSON HOLD A ROLE IN, and WHICH FIRMS DOES
 * THE REGISTER PUT IN THIS ROOF — are answered once, here, off the compiled
 * index, and `people.js` and `popup.js` share the answer instead of each folding
 * 196 rows their own way.
 *
 * `byPerson` reads each row's `people[]`, which `compile_businesses.index_people`
 * flattens from proprietors, partners and staff. 144 of those 196 roles name a
 * person the town holds a card for, 110 distinct people between them, and 27 of
 * those hold more than one firm — John Dean Caton holds four, which is a fact
 * about the town that no card said until this.
 *
 * Those counts fell in T-1401 and nothing left the layer: the register printed
 * thirteen of these roles twice, under a second style of the same person's name,
 * and the compiler folds them onto one row now (`also_printed_as` keeps the
 * styles). The fold used to happen here, over an index that double-counted.
 *
 * `byStructure` reads each row's PRIMARY location and answers with TWO relations,
 * because a roof holds houses two ways. `in` is a premises — the register puts the
 * firm in this building — and 22 roofs carry the 30 firms with one. `against` is an
 * `anchored` house: no roof of its own, and the paper sites it by this one. Until
 * T-1401 the second was unanswerable, because the landmark lived only inside
 * `limit_reason`'s sentence and `structure_id` was null on all 26; the compiler now
 * resolves the register's own `action_target` onto `where.anchor`, so the Tremont
 * House names the four houses standing against it and nothing here reads a sentence.
 *
 * Seven of the 26 anchor against another FIRM and four against a street crossing.
 * Neither is a roof, so neither joins this map — the business card prints them, and
 * the firm-to-firm one offers the other firm's card.
 *
 * @param {object|null} index  the compiled `businesses/index.json`
 * @returns {{byPerson: Map<string, object[]>, byStructure: Map<string, object[]>}}
