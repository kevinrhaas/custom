/**
 * census.js — live town/population statistics on the gate screen.
 *
 * T-0036 established the rule: the front screen never carries hand-typed population
 * numbers. Buildings standing comes from `data/town_census.json`. T-0490 extends the
 * same rule to the evidence population: named/attested/inferred/reconstructed counts
 * come directly from `data/residents/index.json`.
 *
 * T-0782 rebuilt what those numbers SAY. The card had three stacked figures, and read
 * top-down they told three unrelated stories — worst of all `29 people housed · of
 * roughly 3,265`, which set a placement figure against the town's whole population and
 * so announced the town as 0.9 % peopled. It is one ladder, twice:
 *
 *   buildings — 359 of the 662 roofs the town held;
 *   people    — 1,404 named of the roughly 3,265 who lived here, and the named count is
 *               itself graded attested → inferred → reconstructed, three portions of the
 *               same bar filling toward the census total.
 *
 * `people housed` survives as what it actually is — a PLACEMENT note under the people
 * row, the named residents standing inside a building that stands — and is never again
 * quoted against 3,265. `projected_residents` stays in the residents manifest for
 * T-0490's readers; it no longer reaches the card, because a parenthesis inside the
 * inferred count read as a fourth grade.
 *
 * T-1365 kept that ladder and fixed what its second rung COUNTED. Both ends of the
 * people row were the wrong population:
 *
 *   the denominator was 3,265, the town census of NOVEMBER 1835, which
 *   `town_census.json`'s own `town_total_note` forbids reading as the scene's
 *   population and which the town model has since resolved to a point of 2,536 within
 *   2,353–3,265 — so the front screen filled toward a bound the reconstruction
 *   programme had already resolved, and the two quoted different towns;
 *
 *   the numerator was every card in the residents index, and most of those people are
 *   not established in Chicago on 1 July at all — a name waiting on a post-office
 *   letter list is a card, not a resident of that Tuesday. 829 of 2,144 are cards.
 *
 * So the row now reads the SAME population at both ends, out of `people.scene`: the
 * residents the layer records present on the scene date, graded as before, filling
 * toward the model's point for that date. The cards the project holds are still said —
 * as cards, on their own line, which is what they are. `people housed` is unmoved.
 *
 * T-1386 changed WHICH of two real figures the rung shows, and made the card say which
 * question its number answers. `people.scene.persons` counts the people a record
 * ESTABLISHES here on 1 July, and that is the strictest reading the layer supports — but
 * it is not the town's population, because it left 827 people the project has attested or
 * inferred evidence for outside the town on an unadjudicated `uncertain`. The owner's rule
 * is that an attested person is the ideal case, so those 827 are now RULED into the town
 * one at a time, each at the tier its own dated readings reach, and the rung shows
 * `people.scene.population` — 2,267 of a modelled 2,536. The established figure is not
 * overwritten: it keeps its own line under the bar, because they are two real measures and
 * the project needs both. Each figure carries its own `question` string from the census as
 * its tooltip, so a visitor can read what they are looking at without leaving the gate.
 *
 * FAIL SOFT, ALWAYS. Either source may be absent while a branch is being built. Show the
 * rows that can be read and never turn a census nicety into a page error on the first
 * screen a visitor sees.
