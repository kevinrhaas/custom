/**
 * walker.js — a person on foot. No physics engine.
 *
 * A capsule sliding on the heightfield sampler, and that is the whole model. It
 * is enough because there is nothing to simulate: no jumping, no vehicles, no
 * ragdolls, and — by standing instruction in `AGENTS.md` — no other people.
 * Importing a physics engine to walk across a prairie would cost a megabyte and
 * a build step to reproduce what forty lines of arithmetic already do.
 *
 * The one rule that is not arbitrary: a **0.35 m step-up limit**. That is a
 * little over a foot, which is what a plank walk stands above the mud and what a
 * person steps onto without thinking. Below it you step up; above it you are
 * looking at a wall and you stop. Downhill is free — you can always step down.
 *
 * The one thing that is not the heightfield: **bridge decks** (T-0001). A deck is
 * a surface the visitor stands on that the terrain knows nothing about, so the
 * floor is `surfaceAt()` rather than `terrain.walkHeight()` and every path in this
 * module asks it. Getting ONTO a deck from the bank asks nothing of this module:
 * the approach earthworks (T-0046) grade the terrain itself to meet each deck at
 * its ends, so the walk up is ordinary heightfield walking and the step from
 * earth to planks is millimetres. See docs/LIBERTIES.md L147.

 * The surfaces a visitor may stand ON TOP OF, as opposed to the ground.

 * structure's own anchor — and it is `null` on all 327 structures that are not a
 * crossing. The number is the generator's `deck_height_m`, carried through by
 * `tools/compile_scene.py`, so the plank a visitor's boot is on and the plank the
 * mesh draws are one number rather than two that agree until they do not.
 *
 * The plan outline is the FOOTPRINT, which for a bridge record is documented as
 * the deck outline rather than a placeholder — so the surface ends exactly where
 * the drawn deck ends, and stepping off the side of one is stepping off the side
 * of what you can see.
 *
 * ONLY water-anchored structures are read. A deck's world height is its anchor
 * plus `walk_surface_m`, and a `water` anchor is a literal zero by the definition
 * of the vertical datum (docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md); resolving a terrain anchor would
 * mean re-deriving the lowest ground under the footprint, which is buildings.js's
 * job and not a calculation to keep a second copy of. Nothing in the dataset needs
