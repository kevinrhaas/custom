/**
 * residents.js — the town's people, in the Evidence panel.
 *
 * ROADMAP K52, from K51. `data/residents/` holds 201 households and 237 person
 * entries, every one of them graded and most of them cited, and unlike this
 * morning's fauna the layer already had *a* reader: `tools/compile_scene.py`
 * attaches a household to a building's sidecar and `popup.js` names it on the
 * building card. K52's own box says that makes it the harder question rather
 * than the easier one — *"a layer with one reader is exactly where an unread
 * figure hides, because 'the browser has it' reads as 'somebody looks at it'."*
 *
 * IT HID SEVENTEEN HOUSEHOLDS. `compile_residents()` reaches a building through
 * `lives_at` or `works_at`, so a household whose residence and workplace are
 * both unattested at the scene date attaches to nothing and appears on no card
 * anywhere — 17 households and 20 person entries, and one of them is the Mark
 * Beaubien household, which is the most famous in the town and one of the
 * thinnest records in the dataset. A dataset that drops a record for being
 * *poorly evidenced* is doing the opposite of what this project's confidence
 * model is for.
 *
 * AND IT CARRIED ONLY A THIRD OF EACH RECORD IT DID REACH. The building card
 * shows a household's name, division, relation, its note and its persons' names,
 * relationships, grades and occupation words. `arrival`, `origin`,
 * `reason_for_coming`, `party_size_on_arrival`, `present_on_scene_date` and
 * `touches_removal` reach nothing; nor do a person's `sex`, `age_on_scene_date`,
 * `birth_year`, `name_basis` or their own `sources`, nor the occupation's grade
 * and reasoning, nor the ten `researched_not_resident` findings — which are the
 * exclusions-style half of the dataset and as load-bearing as the households.
 *
 * TWO EVIDENCE STRENGTHS, KEPT APART (T-0378). The newspaper register reads people
 * out of the Democrat and the American, and the two kinds it reads are not the same
 * claim: a man who advertised his stock is named, dated, placed and given a trade,
 * while a name in the post office's list of uncalled-for letters is a name and
 * nothing else. `mint_letter_list_residents.py` carries `letter_list_only` onto the
 * person for the second kind, and this file is where the distinction has to survive
 * — it reached `gazetteer.json` and `register_1835.json` and stopped there, so on the
 * card the two read identically. It is now a row of its own on the person, and a
 * clause in the section's own count sentence.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is a card, not a crowd. Nothing here is drawn: L1 and
 * AGENTS.md stand, v1 ships no human figures, and the standing constraint on
 * depicting the Potawatomi in the year of the removal is untouched by a section
 * that publishes what the sources say and nothing else.
 *
 * AND THEN THAT DISTINCTION BECAME THE SHAPE OF THE SECTION (T-0379). The owner was
 * asked how many of the letter-list names the town should hold and ruled, on
 * 30 August 2026, that it should hold every one the evidence admits. That is the
 * largest single change to this town's population the corpus can make — it took it
 * from a couple of hundred people to most of a thousand, roughly three quarters of
 * them a name on a post-office list and nothing else — and the ruling set its own
 * test for whether the implementation was any good: *a visitor who looks at the
 * whole must be able to tell at a glance which three quarters are names alone. If
 * that reads as a wall of undifferentiated people, the ruling has been implemented
 * badly, not chosen badly.* So the list is SPLIT rather than sorted: the households
 * the rest of the corpus documents keep the section they had, at the length they
 * had, and the cohort sits under them in one closed group that says what it is.
 *
 * ONE FETCH, THEN ONE PER HOUSEHOLD A VISITOR OPENS. The manifest is a
 * denormalised summary of every record — `tools/validate.py` fails the build
 * when a copy disagrees with its record — so the list renders from a single
 * file, and the full record is fetched the first time its own row is opened.
 * A fetch per household on mount, to show that many collapsed summaries, would be
 * a worse card and a slower one; the summary is the manifest's job and the manifest
 * says so. That was true of 201 records and it is the load-bearing decision at 920.

/**
 * THE CONSOLIDATION'S OWN READING, WHICH NOTHING SHOWED (T-0668).
 *
 * `tools/consolidate_resident_evidence.py` reads seven source domains, decides who
 * is who, and grades each person on a ratified ladder. It writes the whole of that
 * work onto the person: the rung it fired (`ladder_rule`), the fact that the person
 * exists in this layer because that consolidation minted them (`civic_mint`), and
 * every appearance it spent — a quoted reading of the name, the list it stands in,
 * where on the page, the record id, the date the line describes and the source.
 *
 * FORTY-FOUR FIGURES ACROSS 531 PEOPLE, and `tools/measure_layer_reads.py` had
 * every one of them banked as reaching nothing. That is the defect T-0491 named on
 * the 1840 bridge, at twenty times the scale: a grade is a VERDICT, the appearances
 * are the argument that produced it, and a verdict shipped without its argument is
 * an assertion. A reader cannot disagree with `attested` unless they can see the
 * rung that awarded it and the lines it was awarded on.
 *
 * THE RUNG'S TEXT COMES FROM THE DATA, not from here. `GRADE_RULES` in the
 * consolidation tool is the ratified ladder and it is Python; this section reads
 * `vocabulary.ladder_rules` out of `data/residents/index.json`, which that tool
 * writes and its gated `--check` holds equal to the constant. Restating a rung in
 * JavaScript would have been two answers to one question, and the one on the card
 * would be the one that drifted.
 *
 * EVERY LINE CARRIES THE DATE IT DESCRIBES, and that is the section rather than a
 * caveat on it. The domains are not contemporaries of each other: the 1833-1835
 * press names a person in this town, the 1844 directory names them nine years
 * after this scene, and the ladder grades those differently on purpose. A block
 * that showed the readings without their dates would flatten the one distinction
 * the whole consolidation is built on.

 * make his "temporary lodging place and study" in the loft of an unfinished store
 * in 1833, and says nothing about whether he was still in it on 1 July 1835.
 * Written into a singular `lives_at`, that comes out as the household's residence
 * at the scene date — the one claim the source refuses to make. `associated_with[]`
 * is the shape that can hold it, and until this block nothing read it: seven rows
 * on four records reached a browser and were rendered nowhere.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BLOCK WILL NOT DO IS DECIDE WHETHER A ROW REACHES THE SCENE DATE.
 * A role carries the record's own `covers_scene_date` and this block prints it; a
 * place carries no such figure, and computing one here is precisely the
 * flattening the plural shape exists to refuse. An open `to` on this layer means
 * NO SOURCE CLOSES THE RELATIONSHIP — Porter's loft and his charge both say so in
 * their own notes — so an open row is printed as open and the question is left
 * unanswered rather than answered wrongly. Three things can honestly be said, and
 * each is said in the row's own words: a relationship that ENDED before 1 July
 * 1835 (Eliza Chappel Porter's infant school, 1833 to 1834, which nothing in the
 * singular shape could express at all), one that is UNDATED at both ends and
 * admits it, and one that is open at the far end and therefore undecided.
 *
 * The rung is part of the claim, not decoration: `resolves_to` says how far the
 * evidence reached — a roof, a street, a part of town — and a row that names a
 * street is not a row that names a building.

 * `persons[].roles[]` is the canonical record of a trade, a profession or an
 * office — `index.json` `_roles_doc` states it — and `occupation` is a GENERATED
 * view of the roles that cover 1 July 1835. Until this block the card showed only
 * the view, which meant a card could show at most one trade and could show none
 * at all for a man the sources word three times: Daniel Elston is printed a soap
 * and candle manufacturer in November 1833 and a brickmaker in 1839, and his card
 * read `none_recorded` for 1835 with both roles unrendered. 262 people carry 267
 * roles; 140 of them are outside the scene window and were visible nowhere.
 *
 * SO IT IS A TIMELINE, AND EACH ROW SAYS WHETHER IT REACHES THE SCENE DATE. The
 * order is the year a bound opens, undated last. A role that does not reach
 * 1 July 1835 is marked as not reaching it rather than dropped or dimmed away:
 * the whole point of the plural field is that a life has more than one year in
 * it, and `covers_scene_date` is the record's own answer, never recomputed here.
 *
 * WHAT A ROW PRINTS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. The controlled word where the source's
 * wording has been adjudicated into `vocabulary.occupations`, the wording AS
 * PRINTED where it has not — and where `role` is null the row SAYS the wording is
 * not adjudicated, because a printed word standing in for a controlled one is a
 * weaker claim and T-1254 is where the rest are ruled on. The bound is printed at
 * the precision the record gives it, `dated_by` says how it was dated, and an
 * unknown date stays unknown: nothing here widens a bound to the scene date.
 *
 * A role carries no PLACE and no employer yet — that is T-1254's migration — so
 * this block makes no claim about where the work was done. The location half of
 * T-1240 waits on the same data: no record in the layer carries a dated location
 * link or a location limit, and the household's `lives_at`/`works_at` are single
 * undated claims, rendered as such by `householdHtml` above.
