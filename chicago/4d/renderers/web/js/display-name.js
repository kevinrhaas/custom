/**
 * display-name.js — what a building is CALLED, as against what a generator numbered it.
 *
 * The owner, 2026-08-18, looking at a card in the walkthrough: *"this name is not great
 * Reconstructed D3 one-room frame cottage #03 … give the locations useful names not
 * technical D3 #03 names, you can have that somewhere on the card for reference identity
 * purposes but dont make it the title."*
 *
 * He is describing 222 buildings. The anonymous reconstruction programme names its roofs
 * `Reconstructed <family> <description> #<seq>` because that string is what the recipe
 * DERIVES — the family is the archetype the roof was dealt, the sequence is its place in
 * the parcel — and the record has to carry it or the parcel stops being re-derivable. It
 * is a production identity. A town does not use production identities: a house is known
 * by whoever lives in it, and an empty one is known by what it is.
 *
 * So this composes the title a visitor reads, and it composes it FROM THE DATA the record
 * and the residents layer already carry — never from a table somebody typed. Three cases,
 * and the third is the one that needs watching:
 *
 * 1. **Somebody lives there.** 104 of the 222 anonymous roofs were adopted by an inferred
 *    household (`data/residents/`, ROADMAP K1 phase two), so the card can say "The Pratt
 *    house" the way the town would have. A household that only WORKS there gets the
 *    workplace form — "Newell's stable" — because the building is their shop, not their home.
 * 2. **It is an outbuilding.** A privy is a privy. Titling one "vacant" would be a claim
 *    about occupancy for a building nothing occupies.
 * 3. **Nothing is recorded there.** The title says "A vacant one-room frame cottage", or
 *    for premises that would have been offered, the 1830s phrasing the owner asked for:
 *    "…, to let". **That is a liberty and it is recorded as one (L157).** The residents
 *    layer places households on the roofs its trade argument needs and stops; the other
 *    118 roofs are unmodelled, not attested empty, and the card says so in as many words
 *    under the title. The distinction costs one sentence and is exactly the sort of thing
 *    this project would otherwise lose.
 *
 * The production identity is not deleted. `sidecar.name` is untouched — it is what the
 * generators re-derive, what the GLB is named after, and what `smoke_renderer.mjs`'s
 * naming gate reads — and the card prints it under the title as the reference line the
 * owner asked for. Search takes both, so "D3 #017" and "Pratt" both find the same roof.
 *
 * Named and attested buildings do not come through here at all: they have real names from
 * real sources, and their titles are their records' own.
