/**
 * yard.js — the goods a working town left standing on its own ground.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `docs/ROADMAP.md` K5 (c) asks for *"crates and barrels
 * at the stores"* and *"wagons/drays"*, and ticket T-0040 is that clause for
 * the taverns and the stores. Unlike the signboards one layer over, it does not
 * start from silence: the village corporation's **Ordinance 9 of 7 November
 * 1833** is about timber, stone, brick, boxes and barrels stacked in the
 * streets, and a corporation does not legislate against a thing nobody does.
 * What the ordinance gives is the treatment and no location at all, so
 * `tools/generate_yard_goods.py` answers "which frontage" with a rule,
 * `tools/check.sh` re-derives its record byte for byte, and this file only
 * draws what that record says.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT DO.
 *
 *  * It stands its goods on the TERRAIN, not on a building's wall base. A
 *    barrel on a footway rests on the ground it is standing on, so each object
 *    samples `terrain.surfaceHeight` at its own point — which is the opposite
 *    of `signage.js`, where a board must hang off the same datum as the wall it
 *    is bolted to or it floats. Two layers, two right answers.
 *  * IT MARKS THE GOODS (T-0065). This bullet used to say the opposite — no
 *    mark, no brand, no stencil, no label, not on any barrel or case, ever —
 *    and the owner overruled it on 2026-08-18: *"you can add period correct
 *    names and brands and labels to things."* So every cask carries a
 *    stencilled commodity word or the house's own brand burned into its head,
 *    and every case carries a shipping mark. WHAT a mark may say is fenced in
 *    `tools/generate_yard_goods.py` and bounded in docs/LIBERTIES.md L166; this
 *    file only paints what the record says, on ONE CANVAS ATLAS, so a mark
 *    costs no triangles and the layer keeps its one material and its chunked
 *    draw calls. Every vertex that carries no mark samples a white cell, which
 *    multiplies to exactly the timber it was before.
 *  * It carries ONE MATERIAL and draws in CULLING-SIZED CHUNKS (T-0064). It was
 *    one draw call for the whole layer for as long as the layer was a hundred
 *    and fifty barrels on twenty-six frontages and four wagons — and it kept
 *    that one call when the canvas arrived, because a tilt is not timber and
 *    must not read as timber, so the tone moved onto the VERTICES rather than
 *    into a second material. Then T-0064 put sixty-four more wagons across the whole
 *    town, and a single geometry spanning the whole town has a bounding sphere
 *    no frustum ever culls: every wagon in Chicago would draw in every frame,
 *    including the ones behind the camera. T-0115 measured exactly that on the
 *    fences and named it the largest free saving left in the scene; T-0119 fixed
 *    it for the river walk and T-0067 for the fences. So the goods now go into
 *    `CHUNK_M`-square buckets by where they stand, one mesh each, all on the
 *    same material — and the draw-call principle bends exactly as far as culling
 *    needs it to and no further.
 *  * It marks itself. Every vertex carries `_confidence` at `reconstructed`,
 *    because the FACT of goods on these frontages is reconstructed — the
 *    weakest thing deciding that the vertex exists at all. So the whole layer
 *    disappears when a visitor hides `reconstructed`, and the town goes back to
 *    standing on swept ground. That is the truthful behaviour.
 *  * It answers a pick. A barrel belongs to the business whose door it stands
 *    at, so clicking it opens that business's card — the same contract the
 *    signboards keep.
 *  * IT DRAWS THE OTHER HALF OF THE ORDINANCE (T-0057), and it is a second record
 *    rather than a second column on the first. Ordinance 9 names *timber, stone,
 *    brick, boxes and barrels*; the boxes and barrels are a merchant's stock on his
 *    own frontage, and the three building materials are stock of a completely
 *    different kind — they belong to a building that is GOING UP. Only one structure
 *    in this scene says it was: `lake_house_construction`, a roofless brick shell
 *    whose `function` is `hotel_under_construction`, attested. So brick, squared
 *    timber and footing stone stand on that lot and on no other, `data/yard/
 *    lot_building_material.json` argues which face each gets, and this file only
 *    draws them. They are the only things on the layer that are not timber or
 *    canvas: brick is the town's own chimney brick and stone is a bounded grey.
 *  * It draws A ROOF, once: the open-sided wagon shed at the Green Tree's yard
 *    end (T-0081), posts and plates and a lean-to over a covered wagon. It is
 *    still not a structure record and still not baked — it is derived from that
 *    inn's committed footprint the way a fence is derived from a perimeter — and
 *    the record argues which wall and how big. This file only draws it.
 *  * It draws NO PEOPLE, and the bench at the Green Tree is where that bites.
 *    The Trowbridge view of that inn shows a bench of SITTERS against its front
 *    wall; AGENTS.md's standing constraint is not relaxed by a plate, so what is
 *    taken from the picture is the bench and the sitters stay reference. A bench
 *    with nobody on it is the honest half of that image.
 *  * It draws NO DRAFT ANIMALS either, and after T-0064 that is the constraint
 *    with the most geometry hanging off it. Sixty-eight wagons — farm boxes,
 *    covered emigrant wagons and two-wheeled carts — stand at the verges of this
 *    town's streets and in its working yards — and every one of them stands
 *    UNHITCHED, because this project models no animal in the scene at all
 *    (`fauna.js` is a card, not a herd). A wagon's tongue and a cart's shafts lie
 *    DOWN ON THE GROUND at their own inclination, and the covered wagons and the
 *    yard wagons have an ox-yoke lying on the grass beside them. The yoke is the
 *    honest half of a team, the same way the empty bench is the honest half of
 *    the Trowbridge sitters.
 *  * T-0759 ADDS ONE MORE VEHICLE AND IT IS NOT ON A STREET. Andreas's Water
 *    Works section says how this town drank in 1835 — from the lake, by cart —
 *    and describes the vehicle exactly: "two wheeled vehicles, upon which
 *    hogsheads were mounted", driven into the water "generally at the foot of
 *    Randolph Street". So `buildCart` gained a cask, mounted when the record
 *    says `hogshead`, and `data/yard/town_water_cart.json` stands ONE of them
 *    at the point Randolph's committed line meets the committed waterline. One,
 *    and only there: the same sentence sends the watermen "around town" to
 *    "their customers' houses" and names no street, no door and no count, and
 *    dealing barrels to doors off that would be inventing a business's customer
 *    list. What is refused is written on the record, not only here.

 * ONE PILE OF BUILDING MATERIAL on a lot that was going up — T-0057, and the other

 * material belongs to a building that is being BUILT, and only one record in this
 * scene says any building was.
 *
 * THE FRAME IS THE LAYER'S OWN, unchanged: the record's `bearing_deg` is the compass
 * bearing of the face the pile stands off, so along that face is (cos b, sin b) in
 * world XZ and out of it is (sin b, -cos b) — the same two lines every barrel and
 * every signboard in this town is placed by. The pile stands on the TERRAIN at its own
 * point, like everything else on this layer and unlike the boards one layer over.
 *
 * EVERY SIZE IS THE RECORD'S. How many courses a timber pile is, how many blocks a
 * heap holds and how the two brick tiers step are all in `form`, graded and noted
 * there. What is this file's is what a triangle is made of: which way a block of
 * rubble happens to be lying, which is not a claim anybody can make about a heap.
