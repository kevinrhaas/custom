/**
 * wells.js — the well heads this project can place to a coordinate, drawn from a
 * point instead of a footprint (T-0887).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The 1830 Harrison plan draws a small ring on Fort
 * Dearborn's outer ground and letters it `Well`; Gurdon Hubbard, independently
 * and from memory, puts the fort's well *"in the outer inclosure and near the
 * south gate"*. T-0881 measured the ring — local east 1152.50, north 139.53,
 * all but exactly due south of the enclosure's centre — and then could not do
 * anything with the measurement, for a reason that is worth stating in full
 * because it is the whole argument for this layer: `data/structures.schema.json`
 * offers twelve archetypes and none of them is a well. The nearest,
 * `outbuilding`, builds a walled and roofed shed, and a shed is not a well head.
 * A structure record with no buildable form does not validate, so the fort's
 * well could not even be carried as an EVIDENCE record the way the estray pen
 * is — the pen has `data/enclosures/` and `enclosures.js` behind it, and there
 * was no equivalent here. The reading sat in `docs/RESEARCH/wells.md` § 5 with
 * nothing to attach it to.
 *
 * This is that equivalent, and it is the same argument one layer over: a curb is
 * a ring of low timber standing on the committed heightfield, so it is built at
 * load from committed numbers — no GLB, no `assets/`, no nightly, no archetype.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT DO.
 *
 *  * IT MINTS NO WELLS. T-0592 refused a well CLASS for the town and that
 *    refusal stands in full: wells attach to houses everywhere, so drawing one
 *    unplaced well is a statement about all the others. What this layer draws is
 *    a PLACE — a well a source puts at a coordinate — and it enforces that
 *    mechanically rather than by good intentions: a well whose
 *    `position_confidence` is not `documented` or `attested` is REFUSED, with
 *    the reason recorded as a problem. The refusal is the point of the guard; it
 *    is what stops a future record quietly distributing well heads across the
 *    South Division.
 *  * IT DRAWS A CURB AND NOTHING MORE. No windlass, no sweep, no rope, no
 *    bucket and no roof. Water is got out of a well by one of those three
 *    mechanisms, they look completely different from one another, and no source
 *    reached says which stood here — so choosing one would be the largest
 *    invention on the record and the most visible thing in the scene. The
 *    residual is stated on the record (`lifting_gear`) rather than hidden.
 *  * THE CURB ITSELF IS INVENTED, all of it — plan, diameter, height, thickness
 *    and material — and `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L232 claims it. The plate's ring is
 *    a POINT SYMBOL: its 14 px would be 4.7 m, no well at this fort was four and
 *    a half metres across, and the record refuses to take any dimension from it.
 *  * IT DRAPES. The rim's ground line is `terrain.surfaceHeight()` at the well's
 *    own point, sampled at load — the bridge's lesson (T-0001) again: no height
 *    here is authored beside the mesh.
 *  * IT REFUSES WATER. A well head whose foot is under the river mask is dropped,
 *    the way `trees.js` refuses a stem below the waterline and `enclosures.js`
 *    refuses a post. A well standing in the river would be a claim about a
 *    shoreline this layer knows nothing of.
 *  * IT MARKS ITSELF. Every vertex carries `_confidence` at `reconstructed`, so
 *    the whole well disappears when a visitor hides that tier and the fort's
 *    outer ground goes honestly blank again. The POSITION is documented and the
 *    FABRIC is not, and the confidence view is how a visitor is told the
 *    difference.
 *  * IT ANSWERS A PICK. A well belongs to no structure, so aiming at one opens a
 *    card built from the well's OWN record — the same arrangement the boats keep
 *    (T-0063): where it is, what is read, and what was invented to draw it.
