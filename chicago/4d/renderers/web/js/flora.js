/**
 * flora.js — the sward you stand in.
 *
 * The walkthrough's ground was a painted plane. This module puts the July 1835
 * lake-plain prairie on top of it: chest-high layered vegetation that hides the
 * ground a few metres from the camera and falls off into a green sea.
 *
 * It invents no plant. Which community is where (`extent`), what grows in it
 * (`species`), how tall it is ON 1 JULY (`height_m`), how much ground it covers
 * (`abundance`), its leaf colour and whether it flowers at all (`july`) all come
 * from `data/flora/`. A missing manifest draws NOTHING and says so; there is no
 * fallback community, because an invented prairie looks exactly like a
 * researched one and that is the failure this project exists to avoid
 * (AGENTS.md rule 2).
 *
 * THE JULY GATE, enforced here as well as in the data. A flower head is drawn
 * if and only if the record carries a `july.inflorescence` AND its phenology is
 * not `vegetative` or `budding`. Big bluestem, Indian grass and switchgrass are
 * vegetative in mid-July, and the dossier calls 2 m "turkey-foot" seed heads in
 * July "the single most common historical-reconstruction error". Keying the
 * head off the record makes that error impossible to draw: no code path puts an
 * inflorescence on a plant whose record has none. A record that contradicts
 * itself is a defect, not a licence, and it is reported.
 *
 * THREE LAYERS, because a prairie seen from inside it is three problems:
 *
 *   NEAR  to ~8 m   blade geometry. The layer the eye reads as plants, and the
 *                   one that has to hide the ground — at eye height the nearest
 *                   ground in frame is 3.4 m away.
 *   MID   to ~27 m  a blade is a third of a pixel at 20 m. Clump cards turned
 *                   to the camera: silhouette and colour, all that survives.
 *   FAR   beyond the instanced plants, the terrain material's procedural
 *                   prairie texture carries the unresolved colour. There is
 *                   deliberately no second horizontal vegetation surface:
 *                   one at plant-top height reads as elevated ground, hides
 *                   building bases, and leaves the visitor walking underneath
 *                   it at banks. Detailed plants remain rooted on the terrain.
 *
 * Placement is a deterministic world lattice: a plant's position, species,
 * height and colour are a hash of its cell, so re-centring on a walking camera
 * regenerates the same plants and nothing swims underfoot. Only the ring edge
 * changes, and it is scaled in rather than popped.
 *
 * Procedural per AGENTS.md and the publish budget: no image asset, no binary,
 * a bounded handful of draw calls. Every material carries `_CONFIDENCE` as a per-INSTANCE
 * attribute, so the confidence view grades each plant by its species' evidence.

 * July midday light ON A LEAF, which is not the same problem as light on a wall.
 *
 * A sward lit only by reflection cannot be brighter than its own albedo, and a
 * green leaf's albedo is about 0.14 in the green channel: under any exposure
 * that keeps a whitewashed wall white, a purely reflective prairie tops out at
 * about half grey and stays there. Measured against the bar that is exactly the
 * failure — round 1 put ZERO pixels over luminance 180 in the near five metres
 * where the July photographs put 15.0% (Woodworth) and 4.0% even in the October
 * negative control, and its p99 was 132 against the photographs' 252.
 *
 * The missing physics is that a grass blade is a thin membrane. It TRANSMITS:
 * roughly a fifth of the light that lands on it comes out the other side, and
 * it comes out FORWARD-SCATTERED, so the lobe leaving the far face is several
 * times brighter than an isotropic one. That is why a backlit blade out-glows
 * every front-lit blade around it, and it is what makes the photographs' white
 * tail. The transmitted light is filtered by chlorophyll on the way through,
 * which is why the tail is GREEN and not a white blowout. On top of that the
 * cuticle is a waxy film with a narrow specular lobe, which supplies the
 * glints, and the sky passes through the blade as well, which is what keeps
 * the shaded face off black now that it is no longer given a fake sunward

/**
 * ROADMAP K49(a) — WHICH LISTS DEAL THEIR SLOTS OFF NUMBERS THAT ARE NOT IN THE
 * SAME UNIT, and which records cannot be converted into one.
 *
 * Reported and NOT gated, deliberately, the way R-M1 splits a measurement from
 * the bar it will eventually be held to: the repair needs a footprint this
 * dataset does not carry for every species, so a gate here today would either
 * fail the build over data nobody has researched yet or be satisfied by an
 * invented number. Both are worse than a figure printed every run. K49(c) is
 * the fix, and it starts by closing `unconvertible`.
 *
 * K49(c1) CLOSED `unconvertible`: the twenty-five sward records that gave a
 * cover and no footprint carry one now, each graded in its own
 * `width_provenance` because no source states one, and `tools/validate.py`
 * refuses a new sward record that carries a cover without a width. So this
 * list is expected to be EMPTY and an entry in it is a defect rather than a
 * research gap. `mixed` stays non-empty and stays a report: a list whose
 * species record their abundance in different fields is a fact about the
 * dataset, and it stops being a FAULT when K49(c2) deals the slots on `stems`.
 *
 * `mixed` is one row per (community, list) whose species do not agree on what
 * their abundance measures. `countedShare` is how much of that list's slot
 * lottery is currently held by its COUNT-recorded species — the share that is
 * being compared against an area and therefore means nothing as it stands.
 *
 * ROADMAP K54 — AND `basis` IS WHICH SUM THE LIST'S SLOT COUNT IS DEALT OFF,
 * because that is where the mixing still bites. K49(c2) moved the LOTTERY onto
 * `stems` and said in as many words that the slot count was left on the recorded
 * sum; a list dealt off `recorded` while mixing an area with a count is
 * therefore still adding cover fractions to plants per m², and that arithmetic
 * planted `z05_riverbank_timber`'s understory at 8.8× its own record.
 *
 * ROADMAP K55 CLOSED IT, and `basis` now comes from `SLOT_BASIS` rather than
 * from a rule written twice. Both lattice strata read `stems`; the matrix reads
 * `null` because its slot count is `cover.matrix_fraction` and never this sum,
 * so its `mixed` row is about the LOTTERY only and there is nothing in it to
 * move. That is why the column used to name three matrix rows as K55 work: it
 * printed `subsetOn`'s default argument, not what the renderer does with the
 * list. A mixed row is a fact about the dataset from here on, not a defect.

/**
 * ROADMAP K49(d) — THE DENSE LAYER'S STRATIFICATION, AND WHY IT IS NOT A LATTICE.
 *
 * K49(b) left the near and mid tufts on an independent `rng()` because the
 * rank-1 lattice above ROWS the prairie. That was a veto on the construction,
 * not on the goal: the matrix lists' worst shortfall was **31.47 slots** — the
 * mesic prairie deals 793 slots between four grasses and one of them came up
 * thirty-one short of the cover its own record states — and nothing had reduced
 * it.
 *
 * The striping is not the rare end of the CDF, it is the common one. At
 * `matrixShare ≈ 0.6` the test `u < share` selects most of a lattice, so the
 * SELECTED SET inherits the lattice's structure and the field inherits it in
 * turn. Any construction whose slot-to-`u` map has a direction in it will do
 * this at that density. So the requirement is a stratification with no direction
 * to read.
 *
 * A keyed pseudorandom BIJECTION over the block's slots is that. Every slot in a
 * 16×16-cell block is dealt a distinct rank in `[0, n)`, so `u` takes each of the
 * n equally spaced values exactly once: a CDF band of width w gets its exact
 * count `round(w·n)` inside the block, not a Poisson draw around it. And because
 * the map from slot to rank is a hashed permutation rather than an arithmetic
 * progression, the ranks carry no gradient across the grid — the selected set is
 * spatially indistinguishable from the independent draw it replaces, which is
 * exactly what the screenshot in K49(b) demanded and the lattice could not give.
 *
 * A four-round Feistel network is the standard form and is used here: it is a
 * bijection by construction (each round is invertible whatever the round
 * function does), it needs no table, and it is a pure function of the slot's
 * world coordinates, so re-centring the lattice puts the same plant back — the
 * same promise `hash3` makes and K48's account-keeping picker cannot.
 *
 * ITS WEAKNESS, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED: exactness over the BLOCK is not
 * equidistribution over a sub-window, and the census reads zone ∩ ring, which is
 * one. It bounds the error to what the block boundaries cut, instead of removing
 * it. The matrix tail is already empty (K49(a) found no absent matrix species),
 * so the tail is not what this is for — the shortfall is.
 *
 * THAT LAST SENTENCE WAS WRONG WITHIN THE DAY, AND K49(f) IS WHY. The tail was
 * empty when it was written and this construction emptied it the other way: a
 * fixed grid of `u` puts every band narrower than one step out of the scene
 * ALTOGETHER, and two of the dataset's forty-five matrix bands are. Read
 * `stratum`'s own doc block below before changing anything here — the repair is
 * the block's phase, and it also recovers most of the regression the paragraph
 * below blames on a filter.
 *
 * ...and it was thought to have a SECOND face that cost two rows of the census.
 * IT DOES NOT, AND THE PARAGRAPH THAT SAID SO IS STRUCK. What it said was: rank
 * is a deterministic function of position inside the block, so a filter running
 * AFTER the deal on a spatial rule of its own — `station()` refusing a building
 * footprint or the far side of a waterline — selects a BIASED set of ranks; and
 * therefore, do not reach for `stratum` in a heavily filtered layer. K49(f)
 * refuted the settled-town half the same day, by fixing the fixed grid instead.
 * **T-0018 / K49(e) refutes the mechanism itself** —
 * `tools/measure_rank_bias.mjs`, which runs the deal out of THIS file:
 *
 *   position → rank is `feistel(idx, half, blockHash)`, and `blockHash` is
 *   `hash3(bc, br, salt ^ STRAT_SALT)` — RE-KEYED IN EVERY BLOCK. A spatial rule
 *   does not know that key, so the ranks it accepts are an arbitrary subset,
 *   independently re-drawn block by block. Pooled, they are uniform.
 *
 * Measured over 400 independent layer keys, chi-square on 15 df against uniform:
 * a waterline half-plane **2.0**, a footprint disc **4.1**, a street stripe
 * **2.3** — against a rank-blind control at **4.7** and a critical value of 37.7
 * at p = 0.001. A filter deliberately written to read the rank scores
 * **100,800**, so the instrument goes red by four orders of magnitude when there
 * is something to catch.
 *
 * SO THE RULE IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE ONE THAT WAS WRITTEN HERE. Reach for
 * `stratum` in a filtered layer: filtered, it still beats an independent draw
 * (mix deviation per 100 planted slots — unfiltered **0.83**, thinned to ~60 %
 * **3.2–5.0**, independent **5.83**). What a filter costs is the STRATIFICATION,
 * not the accuracy: the surviving `u` are no longer equally spaced, so the deal
 * slides back towards Poisson at about the rate it thins. Expect precision to
 * degrade with filtering; do not expect a lean.

 * ...and the block is FOUR cells square, not the lattice's sixteen, because

 * cells* — points the other way for a dense layer. The forb layer plants a few
 * per cent of what it deals and needed 1,024 slots to resolve a species band;
 * the matrix layer plants `matrixShare ≈ 0.6` of them, thirty times the rate, so
 * 64 slots already carry ~38 plants — more than the forb layer's 16×16 block
 * ever did.
 *
 * And the small block is not merely sufficient, it is BETTER, for the reason the
 * parcel's own weakness names: exactness holds over the block and the census
 * reads a sub-window, so the error is whatever the window's partial blocks cut.
 * A near ring is 15.2 m across and a 16-cell block is 11.8 m — the window
 * contained about ONE whole block, so almost every slot read was in a partial
 * one. At four cells it is 3.0 m and the same window holds ~20.
 *
 * So the rule has a FLOOR and a CEILING, and only the floor was written down.
 * Measured, all five, on the matrix `deviation` of `tools/measure_sward_draw.mjs`
 * — never on `worstShortfall`, which is a max of a max and ranks these in a
 * different order:
 *
 * | block | m (near) | slots | matrix deviation |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | independent draw | — | — | 368.80 |
 * | 1 cell | 0.74 | 4 | 2,725.88 |
 * | 2 cells | 1.48 | 16 | 602.95 |
 * | **4 cells** | **2.96** | **64** | **282.89** |
 * | 8 cells | 5.92 | 256 | 303.30 |
 * | 16 cells | 11.84 | 1,024 | 340.47 |
 *
 * The floor is not a soft one: at four slots per block `u ∈ {0.125, 0.375,
 * 0.625, 0.875}`, so at `share ≈ 0.6` exactly two are planted and `u / share`
 * takes TWO values — the CDF collapses onto two species and the deviation is
 * seven times the fault being repaired.

 * ROADMAP K49(c2) — AND THE PHASE HAS TO SWEEP THE STEP, or a species owed ONE

 * K49(f) gave every block its own RANDOM phase, which is unbiased and is what
 * fixed the species drawn nowhere in the WORLD: a band of width `w` lands on a
 * dealt value in about `w · n` of the blocks instead of in all of them or none.
 * What it does not fix is the frame. A band with `w · n = 0.077` — the sedge
 * meadow's two bulrushes, measured — is a coin toss per block, and over the
 * fourteen blocks a station's ring holds it comes up empty about a third of the
 * time. The species is owed 1.10 slots and draws none, at random, which is the
 * one thing K49(f)'s gate is absolute about.
 *
 * So the phases are STRATIFIED ACROSS BLOCKS as well as within one. The block's
 * phase is `globalShift + vdc(morton(block)) / n`: a van der Corput sweep of the
 * step `[0, 1/n)`, indexed by the block's Morton code, on a random global start.
 * Three properties, and the parcel needs all three:
 *
 * - **The set inside a block is untouched** — the n values are still equally
 *   spaced by `1/n`, so it is still an exact stratification and K49(d)'s
 *   deviation result stands by construction.
 * - **Adjacent blocks get maximally separated phases.** Reversing the bits of
 *   the Morton code sends the block coordinates' LOW bits to the top of the
 *   fraction, so the four blocks of any aligned 2×2 group hold phases exactly
 *   `1/4` of the step apart, sixteen of a 4×4 group `1/16` apart. A band wider
 *   than the sweep's spacing is then hit BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by luck.
 * - **It stays unbiased.** `globalShift` is one random start for the layer, so
 *   a band of width `w` still lands in `w · n` of the blocks on average; what
 *   changes is the variance, which is the whole complaint.

 * across, so `height_m` scales the stems and the recorded clump half-width
 * scales the spread (`placeShrub`).
 *
 * **Multi-stemmed from the ground is the whole diagnosis, not decoration.** It
 * is what separates a shrub from a tree above it and from a forb beside it, and
 * three of these records say so in their own text: the black-oak grubs are
 * *"multi-stemmed low clonal oak sprouting from an old root system"*, the plum
 * is *"thicket-forming"*, the sand cherry a *"low sprawling mat"*. A single
 * stalk cannot read as any of those at any size.
 *
 * **The proportions are a RECONSTRUCTION and are recorded as one** (`docs/
 * LIBERTIES.md`). No source in this repository states the branching habit of a
 * Chicago hazel or a river-bank dogwood, and the alternative to inventing one
 * within bounds is the wand that is there today. What bounds it: the stems rise
 * to 0.55-0.95 of the recorded height and lean out to 0.30-0.55 of the recorded
 * half-width, so the SILHOUETTE is the record's own two numbers and only the
 * arrangement inside it is invented. Nothing here reads a figure the record
 * does not carry.
 *
 * Cost: 104 triangles against the forb's 12 and the near tuft's 27 — 40 until
 * K56 raised the spray count to 32 and K57 to 48, each +32. It is drawn from the
 * forb lattice, so it takes slots the forb archetype used to take rather than
 * adding any, and the 167 of them the census counts in the wet woods' ring is
 * 17,368 triangles there, 1.7 % of the scene's million. The layout and the grain are `shrub-grain.js`;
