/**
 * signage.js — the signs the town's businesses put out, and what each one says.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `docs/ROADMAP.md` K5 (b) asked for signboards on the
 * businesses. T-0039 built the layer: a plank on a bracket, hung off a wall this
 * project had already drawn, on every frontage a rule selected. Every one of
 * those boards was BLANK and every one hung the same way, because L25 and L130
 * read the absence of a recorded WORDING as a reason to paint nothing at all.
 *
 * T-0066 OVERRULES THAT, on the owner's instruction of 2026-08-18: *"you can and
 * should put the name of the location on the sign board. the sign boards should
 * have variation in color and style and signage font and color, some signs may
 * hang from an awning and others may be on the building or painted on the face
 * of the building. you need to add more signage and be period correct and it is
 * fine if they are reconstructions."* So this file now draws
 *
 *  * the NAME on every sign — `sign_text` on the record, which is the same name
 *    the card behind the sign shows, so a visitor who reads a board and then
 *    taps it is not shown two different businesses;
 *  * five MOUNTINGS — `bracket_board`, `awning_board`, `wall_board`,
 *    `post_board` and `facade_painted`, the last of which is not a board at all
 *    but the name straight onto the boards of the building (image 5 of the
 *    owner's brief shows a whole row of painted fronts at the Tremont);
 *  * and a per-sign STYLE — ground colour, letter colour, letterform and panel,
 *    assigned by the generator so that no two signs within 40 m match.
 *
 * T-0130 RE-WORDED ALL OF IT AND THIS FILE LETTERS THE HIERARCHY. A board no
 * longer carries the record's `name` — that is OUR label for a BUILDING, and a
 * signboard carries what the trade lettered. The record now hands over
 * `sign_lines`, each with a ROLE, and the advertisements' own register is drawn
 * from it: the proprietor or firm FIRST AND LARGEST, the trade beneath it, the
 * place last and smallest ("PHILO CARPENTER / Wholesale & Retail Druggist /
 * South Water Street"). Line sizes are relative (`ROLE_WEIGHT`) and the whole
 * block is then fitted to the board, so a long trade line shrinks the type
 * rather than breaking the hierarchy.
 *
 * The record owns all of it. `tools/generate_business_signboards.py` does the
 * choosing and the arithmetic, `tools/check.sh` re-derives its record byte for
 * byte, and this file only draws what that record says.
 *
 * HOW A NAME GETS ONTO A PLANK, in a project with no build step and no font
 * pipeline. The same way the Green Tree's post board got one in T-0082: a
 * CANVAS drawn at load and handed to three as a texture. What is new here is
 * that there are thirty-three of them in ten different colourways, and a layer
 * that is ONE DRAW CALL cannot have thirty-three textures. So the layer paints
 * ONE ATLAS — a grid of cells, one per sign plus one of plain weathered timber —
 * and every triangle it emits carries a `uv` into that atlas. A bracket arm
 * samples the timber cell; a board's face samples its own painted cell; the
 * name is IN the cell, so the lettering costs no triangles at all and the layer
 * is still a single mesh with a single material.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT DO.
 *
 *  * A sign fixed to a building hangs on the same datum as the wall. Its height
 *    is measured from the base of the building's walls, and `buildings.js` puts
 *    that base at the LOWEST terrain sample under the footprint — so this
 *    samples the same 5×5 grid over the same quad. Any other rule and a board on
 *    sloping ground would float off its own wall. A POST is not on the building:
 *    it stands in the street, so it is measured from the ground under itself.
 *    The record says which datum each sign uses (`height_datum`).
 *  * It draws ONE trade device, and only where the shop's own advertisement
 *    names one. Exactly one does: Philo Carpenter's 1835 notice heads itself
 *    "AT THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN MORTAR", which is a Chicago signboard described
 *    by the man who owned it, so the mortar is PAINTED on his board rather than
 *    the phrase being lettered. That is the opposite case to L25, which stands
 *    untouched: L25 withholds the Wolf Point wolf because that IMAGE was never
 *    described. Every other board is lettering only, and the record decides —
 *    this file draws `sign_device` when it is there and nothing when it is not.
 *  * It is ONE draw call for the whole layer, like the fences.
 *  * It marks itself. Every vertex carries `_confidence` at `reconstructed`,
 *    because the FACT of a sign on these frontages is reconstructed — the
 *    weakest thing deciding that the vertex exists at all — and so, now, are its
 *    wording, its colours and its mounting. So the whole layer disappears when a
 *    visitor hides `reconstructed`, and the town goes back to being mute. That
 *    is the truthful behaviour.
 *  * It answers a pick. A sign belongs to a business with a card behind it, so
 *    clicking it opens the shop — which is what a sign is FOR.

 *
 * AND IT ORIENTS ITSELF, which the box helpers those layers use do not have to.
 * `FACE_TRIS` fixes a winding in the (a, b, c) corner lattice, so whether a face
 * comes out front- or back-facing depends on the HANDEDNESS of the three axes
 * the caller built its corners on — and this layer has callers on both. The box
 * helper's `b` axis runs INTO the wall; the awning hood's runs OUT of it, and
 * the post's knee brace is a third arrangement again. Rather than make every
 * caller get a sign right, each face is tested against the solid's own centre
 * and flipped — normal and winding together — if it came out facing inward. Two
 * of the five mountings were relying on `side: DoubleSide` and three's
 * back-face normal flip to cancel the error out, which is a coincidence to
