/**
 * frontage.js — the plank walks, the board crossings, the hitching posts and the
 * named boards on posts that stand between a building and the street it fronts
 * on. Written for the Green Tree Tavern (T-0082) and made a town layer by the
 * Sauganash Hotel (T-0090), which brought the second record and the first post
 * with nothing hanging on it. T-0119 brought the first record that is not a
 * building's frontage at all — the river plank walk, which rides a committed
 * bridge deck at the slough mouth (`deck_m`), runs on polyline centrelines in
 * culling-sized chunks, registers its over-water planks with the walker
 * (`walkableDecks`), and answers a pick with its own card.
 *
 * T-0069 MADE IT THE STREET'S EDGE. The owner, of the first Cook County jail
 * engraving: *"note the fences lining the street and what appears to be plank
 * sidewalks. all of the streets should be updated like this... at least south of
 * the river or near the river."* The record that answers it
 * (`data/frontage/town_street_edge.json`) is a town's worth of the same two
 * things this file already drew, laid on the platted block faces rather than on
 * a wall, and it brings three additions — all of them additive, and the two
 * inns' and the river walk's geometry comes out byte for byte unchanged:
 *
 *  * **`chunk`.** A walk, a crossing and a fence that carry the same `chunk` id
 *    build ONE mesh with one bounding sphere. That is culling AND draw calls at
 *    once: a block face's sidewalk, the crossing at its corner and the fence
 *    behind it are one street edge and one draw call, so a town's worth of them
 *    costs meshes by the block face rather than by the object.
 *  * **`stringer_pitch_m`.** The stringers under a walk used to be two boxes
 *    under EVERY board — three quarters of a walk's triangles for the strip of
 *    shadow under its edge. A record may now lay them in BAYS instead, and the
 *    generator only sets it where it has audited the ground flat enough for a
 *    bay-length stringer to meet it (see `tools/generate_frontage_works.py`).
 *  * **`fences`.** A board fence at the frontage line, with the walk at its
 *    foot, which is what the jail engraving shows. It is drawn HERE and not by
 *    `enclosures.js` for two reasons that are the same reason: an enclosure
 *    takes a closed PERIMETER and encloses ground that gets its own treatment
 *    (`yards.js`), and a street-lining run is an open line that encloses
 *    nothing — it is the street edge, which is this layer's whole subject. And
 *    sharing the walk's chunk is what keeps the pair inside the draw-call
 *    budget the scene actually has.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A LAYER AND NOT MORE YARD GOODS. A barrel or a wagon stands on a
 * building's own ground and is derived from its walls alone, which is what
 * `yard.js` draws. A walk and a crossing stand in the STREET, and the number
 * that decides where they may lie belongs to the street — the travelled track's
 * own half-width out of `data/streets/1835.json`. This is the first thing in
 * the project derived from a building and a street at once.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT DO.
 *
 *  * Every board sits on the TERRAIN, sampled under its own centre, exactly as
 *    a barrel does. A walk laid on one height would float at one end of a
 *    frontage and be buried at the other, and this ground is not flat.
 *  * It draws LETTERING, and it is the only thing in this renderer that does.
 *    `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L25 leaves the town's one documented board blank
 *    because nobody described the painting on it; this board's subject is a
 *    NAME that the reference view states in as many words, so the wording is
 *    the plate's and only the letterform is invented (L135). The record carries
 *    the text and the argument; this file only draws what the record says, and
 *    a record with no `text` gets a blank board.
 *  * The timber is ONE draw call for the whole layer, the way the fences and
 *    the signboards are. The lettering is a second, because a painted name is a
 *    texture and timber is not — and it exists only when a board carries text.
 *  * It marks itself. Every vertex carries `_confidence`, so the whole layer
 *    disappears when a visitor hides `reconstructed` and the frontage goes back
 *    to bare ground. That is the truthful behaviour: no source record in this
 *    repository states that a walk stood here on 1 July 1835.
 *  * It answers a pick. A walk, a crossing and a post all belong to the building
 *    they were derived from, so aiming at any of them opens that building's card
 *    — which is what a sign is FOR.
 *  * A post carries a board only where the building's own reference views show
 *    one. The Sauganash's posts are hitching posts: chest-high timber under a
 *    capped head, no arm, no board and nothing lettered, because none of its
 *    three views shows a name board at this hotel (its record's
 *    `board_on_a_post` block states that reading rather than leaving it silent).

 *
 * WHERE A BOARD'S TOP COMES FROM, and it moved with this ticket. A board used to
 * sample the terrain under its own centre, which put a fresh height on the deck
 * every 0.32 m; a walk laid in stringer bays does not do that, because the bay
 * is what carries the boards and the bay is one piece of timber. So on a record
 * that states a bay, every board in a bay takes THAT BAY's height — the ground
 * under the bay's own centre plus the walk's rise — which is what makes the top
 * of the string piece and the top of the boards it holds the same line to the
 * millimetre. What is left of the old jitter is one butted joint per bay, and
 * the generator has already audited the ground under a bay flat to
 * `EDGE_STRINGER_ROLL_M` (0.04 m). A record with no bay keeps sampling per
 * board, and its string piece is cut to the same pitch and butted end to end.

 * deck stands above the ground (over the carved channel), the boards take the
 * deck and the string piece is cut to the board's own thickness with no foot,
 * because boards on a deck lie on the deck and nothing has to reach the mud;
 * where the ground stands higher (the graded approaches), the ground wins,
 * exactly as the walker's own surface rule decides it.
 *
 * `stats` accumulates the two numbers the edge rule is reported on (T-0460):
 * how many string pieces were laid, and the largest step between two
 * consecutive ones — which is the whole of what is left of the sawtooth. That a
 * board is flush with the piece holding it is not reported, because on this
 * code path it is true by construction; the gate proves the edge GEOMETRICALLY
 * instead, by walking the outer edge line of a named walk in the loaded page
 * and asking for timber from the deck down to the ground at every station.

   * three bounding spheres. That was right while every furniture mesh cast the

   * see — while a 1.37 m board fence throws about half a metre of it along the
   * walk it stands behind (T-0115's ledger costed both). Drawing the boards into
   * the shadow map buys nothing and costs their whole triangle count a second
   * time, at the two tiers that cast at all.
   *
   * So the standing timber goes into its own buffer, keyed PER STREET rather
   * than per face: one extra mesh for each covered street instead of one for
   * each fenced face. T-0194's hitching posts join it — they are standing
   * timber on the same faces and they ride the meshes that already exist, which
   * is why a post at every trading frontage costs no draw call at all. That is the whole of the draw-call cost — three calls in
   * the colour pass and three in the shadow pass — against the thirty-five
   * ground-hugging chunks that leave the shadow pass entirely. Per-face

     * IN THE TRANSPARENT PASS ON PURPOSE, AND NOT BECAUSE ANY OF IT IS
     * TRANSPARENT (T-0625). This timber is opaque and is drawn opaque: alpha is
     * 1, `depthWrite` stays on, and nothing about the picture blends. The flag
     * is here for ONE reason — it is what puts the layer in the same render
     * list as the street ribbon, so that `renderOrder` below can order the two.
     *
     * WHY THAT IS NEEDED. three sorts opaques and transparents into SEPARATE
     * lists and draws every opaque before any transparent; `renderOrder` sorts
     * WITHIN a list and cannot reach across the two. The street ribbon is
     * `transparent: true` (its alpha is genuinely graded — the track feathers
     * at its edges and the ruts and crown modulate it), so a ribbon set to
     * renderOrder 0 was still drawn AFTER opaque timber set to renderOrder 1.
     * The order the comment on `mesh.renderOrder` describes was never the order
     * that ran, for as long as that comment has been there.
     *
     * WHAT IT COST. The ribbon carries `polygonOffset -8/-32` to stop the
     * terrain punching through its drape (R-BUG2, then R-BUG3 deepening it),
     * and `polygonOffsetFactor` scales with the polygon's depth SLOPE — which at
     * the grazing angle you view a road at is enormous. So the ribbon, drawn
     * last and biased hard toward the camera, painted over the plank crossings
     * standing 0.06 m above it, in hard triangular patches following the
     * terrain's own triangulation. The owner reported it twice: it is the
     * "jagged sawtooth" of T-0460 as seen from the street, and T-0460 fixed the
     * walk's board ends without touching this, which is why it survived that
     * ticket. Measured at the Sauganash crossing: 5.2 % of frame pixels wrong.
     *
     * WHY NOT THE OTHER TWO REPAIRS. Biasing the timber's own polygonOffset
     * past the road's works, but it is an arms race against a number tuned
     * twice already, and it pushes the timber through what it abuts — measured
     * worse than this at -10/-40 and worse again at -16/-64. Making the ribbon
     * opaque also works and is worse still: its alpha is real, and dropping the
     * blend hardens every feathered track edge in the town.
