/**
 * enclosures.js — the town's fence lines, drawn from a perimeter instead of a
 * footprint.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Two liberties in docs/LIBERTIES.md have been waiting on
 * the same missing thing, and both name it in the same words. L10, the Western
 * Hotel: *"A yard is an enclosure — a fence line, two gateways and the ground
 * between them — and `outbuilding` builds a building; using it here would mean
 * calling a fence a building, which is a worse claim than the omission."* L60,
 * the estray pen: *"an enclosure archetype — post-and-rail or notched log,
 * ROOFLESS, gated, taking a perimeter rather than a footprint … it is the honest
 * fix."* Chicago's first public building was a fence, and this project could not
 * build one.
 *
 * The generator half of that fix is a Blender archetype and is not this. This is
 * the RENDERER half, and it needs no bake: an enclosure carries a polyline, a
 * fence type, a height and its gateways, so the same argument that lets
 * `streets.js` draw a wagon track and `flora.js` plant a prairie from committed
 * numbers at load lets this draw a fence. No GLB, no `assets/`, no nightly.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL AND WILL NOT DO.
 *
 *  * It drapes. Every post samples `terrain.surfaceHeight()` at its own foot, so
 *    a fence crossing a slope steps down it. Nothing here regrades the ground
 *    and nothing here is a collision surface — the walker stands on the same
 *    heightfield it always did and walks THROUGH a fence, which is a stated
 *    shortcoming rather than an oversight (see the note in the changelog).
 *  * It knows three fences. `post_and_rail` is the open horizontal thing the wagon
 *    yard and the pound are built from: posts, and courses spanning between them.
 *    `picket` is the Kinzie-view plate's garden fence — the same posts and two
 *    stringers, closed with a run of vertical pales at the record's own pale width
 *    and gap. `board` is the Sauganash's yard fence: the same construction again,
 *    at the record's own board width and a butted gap, and tall. The difference is
 *    not decoration and it is the whole of what each one says: a rail fence turns a
 *    team and you see the yard through it, a picket fence keeps poultry out of the
 *    vegetables, and a board fence is a wall — it says the ground behind it was
 *    private, which is exactly what the three views of that hotel show.
 *  * It refuses water. A post whose foot is in the river mask is dropped, the
 *    way `trees.js` refuses a stem below the waterline. A fence marching into
 *    the water would be a claim about a shoreline this layer knows nothing of.
 *  * It draws in CULLING-SIZED CHUNKS. It used to be one draw call for the whole
 *    layer — posts and rails emitted into a single non-indexed buffer, because a
 *    fence is a lot of very small boxes and eighty draw calls for eighty sticks
 *    is how a phone loses its frame. That was right while the only enclosures
 *    were one yard and one pound, and it stopped being right the moment the
 *    dooryard pickets put fifteen plots across the whole South Division: one
 *    geometry spanning the town has a bounding sphere no frustum ever culls, so
 *    every fence in Chicago was drawn in every frame including the ones behind
 *    the camera — 33,166 triangles, everywhere, forever. T-0115 measured that
 *    and named it the largest free saving left in the scene, and T-0119 had
 *    already solved the same problem one layer over (`frontage.js` builds the
 *    river walk as one mesh per segment). So a mesh is a piece of fence no more
 *    than `CHUNK_M` across, with its own bounding sphere, on the SAME material,
 *    and the draw-call principle bends exactly as far as culling needs it to and
 *    no further. The chunk is a PATCH OF GROUND rather than a run (T-0068): a
 *    town of lot lines is hundreds of two-point runs a few metres long, and one
 *    mesh apiece would be hundreds of draw calls for fences you can see all at
 *    once — so neighbouring runs share a chunk while it stays under `CHUNK_M`,
 *    and the three sides of one lot's yard are one mesh.
 *  * It marks itself. Every vertex carries `_confidence`, and it carries the
 *    grade of the WEAKEST thing that decides where that vertex is — which for
 *    every fence in this dataset is the fence type, and every fence type here is
 *    invented. So the whole layer disappears when a visitor hides
 *    `reconstructed`, which is the truthful behaviour: nobody wrote down what
 *    this fence looked like.

/**
 * WHICH FACES OF A STICK ARE WORTH DRAWING. A fence is thousands of very small
 * boxes, and a box is twelve triangles only if you intend to look at all six of
 * its faces. Every set below drops faces that are BURIED — in the ground, or in
 * the post at either end of a rail — or that carry a fortieth of the
 * silhouette. Nothing here moves a stick, resizes one or changes its rhythm.
 *
 *   `box`     all six. Nothing takes it today; it is the fallback and the
 *             reference the others are read against.
 *   `post`    ten. The underside of a post is under the ground it is driven into.
 *   `rail`    eight. A rail spans from post CENTRE to post centre, so both of its
 *             end caps are inside the post at that end — measured on the widest
 *             rail and the narrowest post on this layer, 45 mm of rail half-width
 *             inside a 50 mm post half-width, at every bay, on every record.
 *             T-0068 costed the six that remain: it is a quarter of the timber on
 *             a rail fence, and rail fences are most of what a town of lot lines
 *             is made of.
 *   `pale`    ten, the same argument as a post: at 3,500 pales the buried
 *             underside is 7,000 triangles nobody can ever see.
 *   `plank`   **four**, which is what a pale takes at `light` (T-0067, costed by
 *             T-0115). A pale is a 22 mm-thick prism, and of its ten triangles SIX
 *             are the two 22 mm edge faces and the 22 mm top cap — three quarters
 *             of the geometry for one fortieth of the silhouette. At `light` a
 *             pale is drawn as a zero-thickness double-sided plank instead: the two
 *             broad faces only, each with its own outward normal so it lights
 *             correctly from either side of the fence without a second material.
 *             The pale keeps its width, its height, its position and its rhythm;
 *             what it loses is a thickness you cannot see from more than a metre
 *             away and could never see at all from the side the fence is meant to
 *             be read from. `full` and `balanced` draw the prism, unchanged.
 *
 * The face order below is +u, -u, +v, -v, top, underside, where `u` runs along
 * the stick — so for a RAIL the ±u pair is the end caps, and for a PALE the ±v
 * pair is the two broad faces.
