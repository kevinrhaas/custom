/**
 * buildings.js — GLBs in, one batch per material out, picks resolved to a
 * structure_id.
 *
 * Three things here are contract, not preference:
 *
 *  1. **Placement comes from the sidecar, never from a baked transform**
 *     (docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md). Whatever transform a node carries inside the GLB
 *     is baked *into the geometry* relative to the structure node, and the
 *     instance matrix is then composed purely from `placement.local_e`,
 *     `local_n` and `rotation_deg`. Re-georeferencing a building is a two-number
 *     edit in a JSON file and never a rebake — which matters, because almost
 *     every position in this dataset is still symbolic.
 *
 *  2. **Identity comes from `extras.structure_id`, never from the node name.**
 *     A structure with several materials exports as ONE node with SEVERAL child
 *     meshes, because a glTF primitive cannot span materials. `extras` lands on
 *     the parent; the children carry empty `userData`. So identity is resolved
 *     by walking *up* the ancestors, and a raycast is resolved through a batch
 *     id we recorded when we built the batch.
 *
 *  3. **One material per batch, and the batch does not care what colour the
 *     building is or how rough it is.** `BatchedMesh` renders one material, so
 *     the buildings become one batch per distinct material. Materials identical
 *     in every rendered respect are collapsed, and BASE COLOUR (R-W5a) and
 *     ROUGHNESS (R-W5a2) ARE CARRIED PER VERTEX rather than per material (see
 *     `materialKey`), so two walls that differ only in paint or finish share a
 *     draw call. The whole untextured town is one draw call in the colour pass
 *     and one in the shadow pass, and it stays one as blocks land.

 * which is what makes the web derivatives small — positions are stored as
 * integers and the DEQUANTISATION is carried on the node as a translation and a
 * scale (6.25 on the Sauganash, for instance). That transform is part of the
 * encoding, not an authored placement. Taking geometry relative to the node
 * itself inverts it and cancels it out, so every building rendered at about a
 * sixth of its size and the ground sank under the water plane while the walker,
 * which reads the heightfield and not the mesh, went on standing at the right
 * height — a scene that looked flooded and left you floating over it.
 *

/**
 * Two materials that render identically should not cost two draw calls — and
 * NEITHER COLOUR NOR ROUGHNESS IS PART OF THE ANSWER, because both are carried
 * per vertex.
 *
 * This is R-W5a, and the measurement is what makes the case. Every one of the
 * 47 building batches in the 2026-08-15 scene was the same
 * `MeshStandardMaterial`: metalness 0, no map of any kind, `DoubleSide`,
 * opaque, no alpha test, smooth-shaded. The ONLY fields that differed were
 * `color` — 39 distinct values across 47 batches — and `roughness`, which takes
 * 16 values. So the town was paying 47 draw calls to render two numbers, and it
 * paid ANOTHER one every time a block landed carrying a paint colour nothing
 * else in the town used: R-G1 measured exactly +11 draw calls for 19 new roofs,
 * and the straight line over the 399 roofs still to come was about +240 against
 * a budget of 80.
 *
 * Taking `color` out of the key collapses those 47 to 16 and, far more
 * importantly, makes a new roof's paint FREE: a block can land any colour it
 * likes without adding a batch.
 *
 * **R-W5a2, 2026-08-17: roughness is out of the key too, and 16 became 1.** It
 * is the shader patch R-W5a declined to write (`perVertexRoughness`), and the
 * reason it was worth writing is not the colour pass: every batch that enters
 * the sun's shadow box is a second draw call in the SHADOW pass, so the town's
 * batch count was setting how far the sun could reach. R-W3b(a) measured the
 * reach as draw-call-bound at ±120 m; this is what unbound it.
 *
 * `emissive` stays in the key: nothing in this dataset uses it, and if
 * something ever does, a glowing material is not something to merge silently
 * into a batch of dark ones.
 *
 * Metalness is compared at THREE DECIMALS rather than exactly, and the reason
 * is the town's two bake pipelines: the bespoke masters carry a float32
 * (`0.8999999761581421`) and the generated infill writes the decimal it
 * authored (`0.9`). Those are the same number to any renderer, and comparing
 * them exactly split buckets in two for no reason a visitor could ever see.
 * (Roughness was in this key on the same footing until R-W5a2 took it out
 * altogether; nothing in the dataset uses two roughness values closer than 0.01
 * on purpose, which is why the quantisation was safe while it lasted.)
 *
 * `roughnessMap` stays in the key even though no asset in this dataset carries
 * one, because `perVertexRoughness` cannot substitute for a chunk that samples
 * a texture — so a mapped material must not be merged with an unmapped one.

   * How much of the facade tone is applied, 0..1 — T-0002's runtime handle.

   * runtime handle, and a gate that cannot turn a thing OFF cannot prove it is
   * on. With this, the suite photographs the same held frame at 1 and at 0 and
   * measures the difference, which is the only evidence that the tone reaches
   * the render rather than merely reaching an array.
   *
   * The rewrite is exact enough to restore: each range is scaled by the ratio
   * between the factor it should carry now and the one it carries, so a round
   * trip to 0 and back leaves float dust rather than a changed frame — and the
   * gate asserts the restored frame, not just the changed one.
