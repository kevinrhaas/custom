"""Parameters for the fort_structure archetype — pure Python, NO bpy import.

Same split, and for the same reason, as frame_tavern_params: tools/check.sh imports
this module on every commit to prove that every scene-included record still resolves
into buildable parameters, and it has to do that in a bare Python 3.11 with no
Blender in the sandbox.

## What this archetype has to cover

The buildings and the furniture INSIDE and BESIDE a garrison post — the things that
are not dwellings, not taverns and not boundaries. Fort Dearborn's own inventory is
the specification, and it is unusually well described for 1835 Chicago because two
witnesses walked round the inside of it and wrote down what stood where:

- Gurdon S. Hubbard, of the fort in 1827 (Andreas I, p. 264): "the brick building,
  just within the north stockade previously occupied by the commanding officers. The
  old officers' quarters built of logs on the west, and within the pickets ... a
  number of voyageurs with their families were living in the soldiers' quarters, on
  the east side of the inclosure. The store-house and guard-house were on either side
  of the southern gate; the sutler's store was east of the north gate, and north of
  the soldiers' barracks; the block-house was located at the southwest and the bastion
  at the northwest corners of the fort, and the magazine, of brick, was situated about
  half way between the west end of the guard and block-houses."
- The key to Alexander Hesler's 1855 photograph, in Wentworth's 1881 address: the
  commandant's quarters "brick, about 25x50 ft.", the officers' quarters "wood, about
  30x60 ft."

So the archetype's `kind` is not decoration: quarters, barracks, blockhouse, magazine,
store, guard, sutler and artillery house are the words the sources use, and each one
selects a different set of decisions the archetype is allowed to make on its own.
`parade`, `root_house` and `tower` extend the same machinery to the fort's ground
furniture and to the 1832 lighthouse, which is a government structure on the same
reservation and has no other archetype it could belong to.

## What it deliberately does not cover

The picket line, its gates and its bastions are the `palisade` archetype's, because
a boundary is a different kind of object from a building. A blockhouse is here and
not there: it has storeys, a roof and a floor.

Interiors are out of scope everywhere in this project, so an opening is a surface
and not a hole. A loophole is a slit in a wall, which at this level of detail is the
same thing.
