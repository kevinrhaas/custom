"""outbuilding — the stable, shed, barn, smokehouse, privy, crib and woodshed family.

A frontier town is mostly outbuildings. The 1835 scene currently holds eight buildings,
all of them public houses, stores or a bridge, and behind every one of them the sources
put a stable, a yard, a pen or a shed that nothing here can build — see
`outbuilding_params` for the attested list and its citations, and docs/LIBERTIES.md L10
for the one the project has already had to admit to in writing.

**This is a family, not a shape**, and the module is organised around the three things
that differ between a privy and a livery stable rather than around one building with
options bolted on:

- **the wall** — hewn log courses (`common/logwork`, so a log shed and a log cabin are
  visibly the same trade), sawn boards nailed up vertically with the gaps showing, or
  boards laid horizontally on a light frame;
- **the top line** — every elevation carries a `_top_z` profile, so an eave wall, a
  gable end and the trapezoid side of a shed roof are one piece of code and the roof
  meets the wall exactly instead of approximately;
- **the opening** — a doorway sized by what has to get through it, cut out of the
  boarding rather than pasted onto it, and posts-and-air where a side is open.

**It is deliberately crude, and the crudeness is geometry rather than a texture.** These
are not small houses. Boards are of uneven width, spaced with gaps you can see daylight
through, and do not all reach the ground; the wall behind them is dark, so the gaps read
as gaps; the roof is boards, not shingles; there is no paint by default, no clapboard
rhythm, no glazing anywhere, and at most one small unglazed vent. The failure mode this
is written against is a neat little cottage: the first thing that makes a shed a shed is
that it was built in a day by someone who was not a joiner.

**The irregularity is deterministic.** `_jit` is a tiny integer hash seeded from the
building's own dimensions and the elevation, not a random number generator, because
`generators/mesh_inputs.py` defines freshness on inputs and a mesh that differs between
two runs of the same parameters would make every outbuilding permanently stale.

**Orientation.** The facade — the `front` side — faces NORTH at rotation_deg 0, per
docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md. In Blender that is the +y face, because the exporter's
`export_yup=True` maps Blender +Y to glTF -Z. The door defaults there. Getting this
wrong is a silent error, so it is stated here as well as in the contract.

**A note on face winding.** Every polygon in this module is emitted through `_face` or
`_prism`, which take their points in the elevation's own (u, z) plane and flip the order
for the two elevations whose local frame is left-handed (`front` and `left`). Blender's
exporter writes `doubleSided: true` for a default material, so a reversed face is
invisible today — but the contract says counter-clockwise and outward, and a renderer
that ever enables culling would find holes rather than a bug report.
