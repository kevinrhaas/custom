"""frame_dwelling — a frame HOUSE: one to two storeys, a rear ell, a stoop.

The archetype the dataset has been missing. Until it existed every frame record had
to be a `frame_tavern` — a two-storey public house with a five-bay front — or a log
cabin, which is why the town so far is three taverns, three log buildings, a store and
a bridge, and not one dwelling. Chicago in July 1835 held about 3,265 people who had
arrived, most of them, within two years (`docs/research/03-structures-north.md` §0), and
almost all of them lived in something this file builds.

**What the evidence gives, and what it does not.** No source reached by this project
describes an ordinary Chicago dwelling of 1835 in elevation. What the dossiers do give
is a set of hard numbers about frame building here in exactly these years, and every
default in `frame_dwelling_params` is built from them rather than from a generic
American frame house:

- **7 1/2 ft ceilings** — the Green Tree's, which its own source calls "rather low for
  a hotel ceiling" (`chicagology_prefire127`, John Gray and Edwin O. Gale). A house was
  not built taller than the hotel, so the storey heights here start there.
- **12 x 12 ft rooms and 6 x 8 in window panes** — the same page, Gale on a guest
  chamber "about 12x12, with two windows 6x8". That pane size is why the windows here
  are small and nearly square-headed rather than tall Federal sash.
- **"a small attic window in the gable end, for we used the attic, too"** — Gray again,
  and the reason the half storey in this archetype is lit from the gables and not from
  dormers. P. F. W. Peck's store on South Water, whose "unfinished loft" Rev. Jeremiah
  Porter lodged in in 1833 (`andreas_1884_v1`, scan p. 627), is the same half storey in
  the same use.
- **"a low one-story addition to the right, the same as on the left"** — Gray on the
  Green Tree, the dataset's one direct attestation of the low subordinate wing this
  archetype builds as the ell.
- **25 x 35 ft, balloon-framed, 1833** — St Mary's church, Augustine D. Taylor
  (`andreas_1884_v1` scan pp. 281, 601): the size of a substantial frame building here
  and the first balloon frame anyone names.
- **Plain.** The First Presbyterian church of 1834 is "plain frame", $600, pine-board
  benches and bare puncheon floors (`andreas_1884_v1` scan p. 623). The first Greek
  Revival house in Chicago is the Clarke House of **1836**, which `data/exclusions.json`
  keeps out of this scene by date. Nothing here builds an entablature, a corner
  pilaster or a portico, and the default front is deliberately irregular.

**Orientation.** The facade faces NORTH at rotation_deg 0, per the pinned convention in
docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md. In Blender that is the +y face, because the exporter's
`export_yup=True` maps Blender +Y to glTF -Z, which the contract defines as north. The
door, the porch and the front windows are all on +y and the ell runs back toward -y.
Getting this wrong is a silent error — the house looks fine and faces the wrong way.

**The ridge runs parallel to the facade, always.** The eaves-front house is the 1835
form; the gable-front house turned end-on to the street is the Greek Revival habit of
the 1840s. `frame_dwelling_params` refuses a range deeper than one and a half times its
frontage rather than build one.

**Balloon framing moves vertices here.** `construction` picks the stud module (16 in
against 24), the module places every opening, a braced frame gets the girt band its
upper floor puts in the siding and a balloon frame does not, and the corner boards
follow. The studs themselves are behind the sheathing on a finished house and are not
modelled, but the one place the frame reaches the surface is: clapboard butt joints
fall on stud lines, staggered course to course, which is what an eye that knows how a
wall is built actually reads off it.

**A note on face winding.** Every quad here is wound so its normal points out of the
building. Blender's exporter writes `doubleSided: true` for a default material, so a
reversed face is invisible today — but the contract says counter-clockwise and outward,
and a renderer that ever enables culling would find holes rather than a bug report.
`_panel` exists so no recessed opening can get this wrong by hand.

    metres. What is new here is the joint.

    **Why the joints matter.** A clapboard is a board, not a ribbon: it runs a few
    metres and then another one starts, and the join has to land on a stud because
    that is the only thing there to nail it to. So the vertical seams in a real wall
    fall on the frame's module and stagger from course to course, and that pattern is
    the one thing about the framing that reaches the outside of a finished house. It
    is also, at walking distance, most of what stops a clapboard wall reading as a
    printed texture. `construction` sets the module, so a balloon frame's seams fall on
    16 in centres and a braced frame's on 24 in ones.

    The stagger is deterministic — a fixed step through the stud lines rather than a
    random draw — because a generator that produced a different wall on every run would

    """Where the openings go across the front, as `(centre_x, kind)`.

    **This is the archetype's answer to docs/LIBERTIES.md L23** — one window
    arrangement on every frame building. The front is not a fixed five bays: the count
    comes from the frontage (or from the record) and the ARRANGEMENT comes from the
    plan behind the wall, which is what actually decides where a door is.

    - `hall_parlour`, the default and the commonest vernacular plan, divides the front
      at the partition between the larger heated hall and the smaller parlour. The door
      opens into the hall, near the middle of it, so it is well off the centre of the
      building and the two rooms' windows are spaced differently from one another —
      with a wider gap over the partition. That gap is the plan showing through the
      wall, and it is what makes the front read as a house rather than as a facade.
    - `centre_passage` is the symmetrical alternative, and it has to be asked for.
    - `single_pen` is one room: a door and a window or two beside it.

    Every centre is then snapped to a stud-bay centre, so an opening's jambs land
    against studs. That is a real constraint on where a window can go in a framed wall,
    and it is what makes the stud module something the facade obeys rather than
    something the sidecar mentions.
