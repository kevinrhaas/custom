## What is actually documented

Two of the three 1835 crossings were log structures of the same crude specification
(docs/research/03-structures-north.md §5):

- **North Branch bridge**, built winter 1831-32 to replace Clybourn's ferry: log
  construction, **about 10 ft wide, clearing the water by about 6 ft**. A variant
  account credits Samuel Miller in 1832 near the south-east corner of Kinzie and Canal,
  "formed of stringers and only fitted for foot passengers", and says the structure was
  "useless for teams" even in the summer of 1833. But on 18 Aug 1835 the war-dance
  procession — some 800 people — "crossed the North Branch bridge", so by then it was
  more than a footway. A rebuild or widening between 1833 and 1835 is likely and
  **unattested**; the dossier lists it as an open gap.

  **Correction, 2026-08-10, made while writing the first record against this module.**
  Of those two numbers only the WIDTH survives the check. Ten feet is Charles Cleaver's,
  recalled in the *Chicago Tribune* of 29 Oct 1893 — "The abutments were built of heavy
  logs in the shallow water near the banks. These bridges were ten feet wide" — and it
  has a source record now (`chicagology_prefire252`). The six-foot clearance has none:
  the dossier tags it `[DOC]` and nothing reached states it. `DOC_CLEARANCE_M` below
  keeps the figure, because it is plausible and it is the dossier's, but the constant's
  name overstates it and `data/structures/north_branch_bridge.json` records the value as
  `inferred`. Cleaver's sentence also earns the abutments their own `documented` tag,
  which is more than the dossier's summary carried.

  **The correction is itself corrected, later the same day, and the constant's name was
  right after all.** Andreas prints at the foot of pp. 631-632 a statement signed by
  J. D. Caton, John Bates, Charles Cleaver and John Noble, agreed at a meeting of old
  settlers in the fall of 1883 (source `old_settlers_bridges_1883`): the branch bridges
  "were about six feet above the water, so that teams passed under them on the ice
  freely". The clearance is documented, and its reason is better than the number — the
  gap under the deck is the winter road. The dossier's `[DOC]` tag was correct and the
  demotion was the right thing to have done in the meantime. The same paragraph is the
  only description anybody wrote of how these crossings were put together, and three
  more of this module's parameters answer to it; see the next section.

## The middle of a bridge is a count and a form, not a spacing

The same 1883 statement says the bridges were "built on abutments and two 'bents'", that
"the bents were of four heavy logs, resting on the bottom, in deeper water", that
stringers ran "from the abutments to the bents, and between the bents", and that on
those stringers "puncheons or split logs were laid for a floor".

This archetype originally took a `pier_spacing_m` and divided the span by it, which over
the North Branch bridge's 71.83 m put **fifteen** supports in the river against the
letter's **two**. The repair is not a different number in the same parameter — it is a
different parameter. A spacing is a builder's convenience and no source will ever state
one; what a witness remembers is *how many* stood in the water and *what they were*. So
`pier_count` is the input, `PIER_SPACING_FALLBACK_M` is what a bridge whose middle nobody
described falls back to, and `pier_kind` gains `bent` beside `crib` and `pile`.

`deck_kind` exists for the same reason. The floor was the archetype's silently until the
letter named it, and an attribute stated on a record has to be one the generator reads —
otherwise the record owes `docs/LIBERTIES.md` an admission for a feature that is in fact
built (see `tools/validate.py`'s geometry declarations).
- **South Branch raft bridge**, winter 1832-33, between Lake and Randolph: the dossiers
  call it a floating log raft, and **that reading did not survive the source that
  describes how these crossings were built.** The paragraph above is why: the 1883
  old-settlers statement is about BOTH branch bridges — "both bridges were built on
  abutments and two 'bents'", "these bridges were about ten feet wide", "these were
  BOTH wagon bridges, and were about six feet above the water, so that teams passed
  under them on the ice freely" — and a floating raft has no abutments, no bents, no
  six feet of air beneath it and no way for a team to pass under it. So the South
  Branch crossing is this archetype after all, and
  `data/structures/south_branch_raft_bridge.json` records the disagreement instead of
  deleting it: the raft is the word every retelling uses, including the account of the
  crossing in use six weeks after the scene date, and the fixed bridge is what four men
  who drove teams over it set down over their signatures.

  **This section said the opposite until 2026-08-11**, and the superseded text is kept
  because its caution was right and only its conclusion was wrong: "Floating is a
  genuinely different structure, and this archetype does NOT model it — a raft has no
  piers and no clearance in the sense used here. It needs its own archetype, and a
  record that points a floating bridge at this one will get a fixed-pier bridge and a
  false impression of solidity." That danger is real, and it is exactly why the record
  carries the conflict on its face rather than in a footnote. What changed is which
  reading the best evidence supports, not the standard for pointing a structure at an
  archetype. If a source ever puts a floating raft on the South Branch in 1835 against
  the settlers' signatures, the answer is a `raft_timber` archetype, not a parameter
  on this one.

The 1834 Dearborn Street drawbridge is a different animal again — Andreas has it about
three hundred feet long, with a sixty-foot draw hoisted between two "gallows" frames —
and **the moving half of it is out of scope here.** This archetype builds the fixed
timber crossing and nothing else, so a drawbridge record has to declare the draw, its
frames and its overall length as things the mesh does not contain (the `geometry:`
declarations `tools/validate.py` enforces) and owe docs/LIBERTIES.md an entry for each.
That is the honest arrangement available today. Building a hoisted leaf and two frames
whose height, section and mechanism no source gives would bolt four inventions onto the
two dimensions anybody actually recorded — and one of those inventions would be the
silhouette a visitor remembers.

## The dimensional confidences run the other way round from a building

frame_tavern established that massing takes the confidence of the attributes saying
what a building WAS, not of its dimensions, because an unknown size and an unknown form
are different kinds of not-knowing. A bridge inverts the premise. "About ten feet wide,
clearing the water by about six feet, of logs" is the *entire* documented description —
the dimensions ARE the character. So `width_m` and `clearance_m` belong in the set that
drives deck and stringer confidence, while `span_m` (nobody recorded the river's width
at the crossing) does not. The rule is unchanged; what changes is which attributes say
what the thing was — and `deck_kind` joined that set on 2026-08-10, when a source turned
out to state the floor.
