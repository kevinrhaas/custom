"""Parameters for the palisade archetype — pure Python, NO bpy import.

Same split, and for the same reason, as frame_tavern_params: tools/check.sh imports
this module on every commit to prove that every scene-included record still resolves
into buildable parameters, and it has to do that in a bare Python 3.11 with no
Blender in the sandbox.

## What this archetype has to cover

An enclosure made of posts standing in the ground — the class of thing that is a
BOUNDARY rather than a building, and which nothing else in this project builds.
Two members of it are in the 1835 dataset:

- **Fort Dearborn's stockade.** Juliette Kinzie, standing inside it in 1831: "The
  fort was inclosed by high pickets, with bastions at the alternate angles. Large
  gates opened to the north and south, and there were small posterns here and there
  for the accommodation of the inmates." Andreas adds that the rebuilt fort "consisted
  of a square stockade" with "two gates, one on the north and the other on the south
  side". The 1830 Harrison plan draws that square with a work at three of its four
  angles. So: a picket line on a rectangle, with named gates and named corner works.
- **The garrison garden.** The same 1830 plan draws a large diamond-shaped plot
  south-west of the fort, labelled "Garden for the Garrison", bounded on two sides by
  a drawn zigzag. A zigzag boundary is the period convention for a worm (snake) rail
  fence, so the archetype builds one — with the reading recorded on the structure and
  not asserted here.

## What it deliberately does not cover

A **blockhouse is a building, not a boundary**, and belongs to `fort_structure` even
when it stands astride the line: it has storeys, a roof and a garrison inside it. The
BASTIONS are here because a bastion of this kind is a re-entrant of the picket line
itself with nothing inside it — that is a fact about the second-system frontier
stockade and not a convenience.

Nothing here models a ditch, a berm or a banquette. None of the three are attested at
Fort Dearborn and a stockade is not automatically earthwork-and-palisade.
