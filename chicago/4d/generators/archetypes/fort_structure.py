"""fort_structure — the buildings and the ground furniture of a garrison post.

Twelve kinds, one builder, because they differ in what the archetype is ALLOWED to
decide rather than in how they are drawn: a magazine gets no windows because a powder
magazine has none, a blockhouse gets a jettied upper storey and loopholes because that
is what makes it a blockhouse rather than a shed, and a parade ground gets no roof
because it is a piece of ground.

**Orientation.** The facade faces NORTH at rotation_deg 0, per the pinned convention
in docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md — in Blender the +y face, because the exporter's
export_yup=True maps Blender +Y to glTF -Z, which the contract defines as north. Every
range inside Fort Dearborn faces the parade, so each record's rotation_deg is the
bearing of the wall that looks inward, and getting it wrong turns a building's back on
the courtyard without anything failing.

**What the log courses look like** comes from common/logwork.py, the same visual
language as the dwellings at the forks. That is deliberate and it is also a claim
worth stating: the fort's log buildings were put up by soldiers with the same tools
and the same timber as the cabins across the river, and there is no evidence they
looked like a different kind of carpentry.

**Openings are surfaces, not holes**, at this level of detail, exactly as in
log_dwelling — an opening cut through would show the inside of the far wall, and
interiors are out of scope.

**Face winding.** Every quad is wound so its normal points out of the solid.

    # carried the town (a working yard two blocks away) does not reach it. Until this
    # parcel that made the garrison's ten stacks the only ones in Chicago painted the
    # colour of the roof they pass through.
    #
    # The fort answers the question on its own ground, and it needs no third row on
    # the sheet:
    #
    #   1. BRICK IS ATTESTED INSIDE THIS FORT, twice and independently. Hubbard,
    #      standing in it in 1827, gives "the brick building, just within the north
    #      stockade" and "the magazine, of brick"; the 1855 key gives the
    #      commandant's quarters as "(brick, about 25x50 ft.)". The masonry here does
    #      not depend on Blodgett and never did: it is on the record, in 1816, on
    #      federal ground, and `fort_dearborn_commandants_quarters` and
    #      `fort_dearborn_magazine` both carry `construction: brick` ATTESTED
    #      because of it.
    #   2. THE STACKS ARE INTERIOR — see `_chimneys`: the depth midline, from the
    #      ground, through the ridge. That is the disposition `common/materials.py`
    #      § the chimney stack answers with brick, and the reason it does is that a
    #      flue carried up inside a timber building has to be masonry. The other
    #      answer, `log_dwelling`'s cat-and-clay, is argued from a stack built
    #      OUTSIDE the gable so it can be pulled away when it catches fire, and no
    #      building in this fort has one.
    #
    # So the fort takes the sheet's existing brick row, INFERRED, and the tier is the
    # honest one: brick on this ground is attested, brick in these particular flues is
    # reasoned from it and from the disposition. Nothing is reconstructed and
    # docs/LIBERTIES.md needs no new entry — L26 already owns where a stack stands.
    # docs/RESEARCH/chimneys.md §4 is the argument in full;
    # `tools/measure_stack_fabric.py` is the gate that stops it regressing.
