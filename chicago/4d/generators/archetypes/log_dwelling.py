"""log_dwelling — a hewn-log building, optionally with a frame addition and a sign.

The commonest building at the forks in 1835 and therefore the archetype that most of
the town will be made of. It has to cover three attested cases without becoming a
kit-of-parts: Wolf Point Tavern (log core, frame extension, painted wolf sign hung
outside by about 1833), Samuel Miller's house (log cabin with a two-storey frame
addition fronting the river) and Rev. Jesse Walker's meeting house ("a small square
log building, originally designed for a school-house" — Wau-Bun). Evidence and its
disagreements: docs/research/03-structures-north.md §2.1, §2.2, §3.1.

**Orientation.** The facade faces NORTH at rotation_deg 0, per the pinned convention
in docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md. In Blender that is the +y face, because the exporter's
`export_yup=True` maps Blender +Y to glTF -Z, which the contract defines as north. The
door, the sign and any front addition are all on +y. Getting this wrong is a silent
error — the building looks fine and faces the wrong way — so it is stated here as well
as in the contract.

**The sign is a board, and since 2026-08-21 it may carry a picture — T-0072.** The
paragraph this replaces read: *"The wolf sign is documented; what the painted wolf
looked like is not, and no image of it survives. So the geometry is a signboard hanging
from a bracket, and the `sign` parameter carries the subject as a string for the sidecar
to report. Painting a wolf on it would be manufacturing evidence in exactly the way
AGENTS.md rule 1 forbids, and it would be the most-photographed invention in the scene."*
It is kept because its caution was right about the one thing that has not changed — the
DRAUGHTSMANSHIP of the Wolf Point wolf is lost and nothing here recovers it.

What changed is that the sources were read further. chicagology's Wolf's Point note
(`chicagology_prefire273`) says how the board was made, hung and decorated: *"Wentworth
was ambitious, and wanted a sign to attract wayfarers. Lieutenant Allen made one for him
out of a piece of a box. He painted a picture of a wolf on it. The fort blacksmith made
hinges, and the wolf sign was hung on a sapling. The tavern was the first institution to
have a sign board in Chicago."* Three things in that passage are geometry — a board, iron
hinges, and a **sapling** rather than a wall bracket — and the 2026-08-18 owner brief's
engraving of the tavern draws exactly that: a mast-tall pole with a cross-arm, the board
flying from it. `sign_mount` builds it.

So a blank board is now a positive misstatement: a source says a picture of a wolf was on
it, and leaving the board empty asserts the opposite of the evidence. `sign_device` paints
a flat canine silhouette — **the FACT is attested and the OUTLINE is this module's own**,
which is the `reconstructed` tier doing its job (AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER) and
is recorded in docs/LIBERTIES.md. It defaults off, so no other board in the town gains a
picture; nothing here licenses a device on a board whose subject is not attested.

**Log courses and corner notching** come from common/logwork.py, which is
frame_tavern._log_wing's visual language factored out. That is deliberate: the
Sauganash's log wing and the Wolf Point Tavern were built by the same handful of people
within a couple of years of each other, and they should look it.

**A note on face winding.** Every quad here is wound so its normal points out of the
building. Blender's exporter writes `doubleSided: true` for a default material, so a
reversed face is invisible today — but the contract says counter-clockwise and outward,
the palette/meshopt steps are entitled to rely on it, and a renderer that ever enables
culling would find holes rather than a bug report. `_panel` exists so no recessed
opening can get this wrong by hand.
