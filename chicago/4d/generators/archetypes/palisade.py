"""palisade — a picket stockade or a worm rail fence standing on a footprint outline.

The first archetype in this project that builds a BOUNDARY rather than a building,
and the two things it makes are the enclosure of Fort Dearborn and the fence round
the garrison's garden.

**Orientation.** As everywhere else, the facade faces NORTH at rotation_deg 0, which
in Blender is the +y face (docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md; the exporter's export_yup=True maps
Blender +Y to glTF -Z, which the contract defines as north). For a stockade "facade"
means the wall the record calls the north wall, and the gate the record puts on `n`
is cut in that wall.

**A picket is a post, not a plank.** Every picket is an individual object with a
sharpened head, because a stockade read as a smooth extruded ribbon is the single
most recognisable way to get a frontier fort wrong, and because the confidence view
has to be able to dither the wall without dithering a texture. The cost is honest
and bounded: `PalisadeParams.picket_count` states it before the bake runs, and Fort
Dearborn's 212 m of curtain comes out near 700 posts at twelve triangles each.

**What is deliberately NOT built.** No ditch, no berm, no banquette, no walkway and
no loopholes in the curtain — none of the five is attested at this fort, and each
would be a claim about how it was defended rather than about what it looked like.
Wau-Bun's "small posterns here and there" are also absent: "here and there" is not a
position, and putting a postern somewhere would invent the one thing the sentence
declines to give. Both absences are recorded on the structure and admitted in
docs/LIBERTIES.md.

**Face winding.** Every quad is wound so its normal points out of the solid, per the
contract, even though Blender's default material exports doubleSided.
