"""frame_tavern — a two-storey frame tavern with an optional attached log wing.

The Sauganash is the reference case, and it is deliberately the first archetype
because it exercises the whole confidence model in one building: the white
two-storey block and its blue shutters are documented, the footprint and roof are
invented, and the attached log wing is inferred from two derivative images.

On construction: balloon framing was developed in Chicago in 1832-33 and became
the dominant local method, but the Sauganash frame block predates that by a year,
so `braced_frame` is the better reading. The geometry that follows is exterior
massing and cladding — the framing question changes stud rhythm behind the
sheathing, which is not modelled at this LOD. Recorded here so the next person
does not assume it was overlooked; see docs/RESEARCH/sauganash_hotel.md.
