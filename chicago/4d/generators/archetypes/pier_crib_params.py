"""Parameters for the pier_crib archetype — pure Python, NO bpy import.

Same split, same reason, as `bridge_timber_params`: `tools/check.sh` imports this on
every commit and must not need Blender.

## What this archetype is for

The two harbour piers at the mouth of the Chicago River — the north (weather) pier
and the south pier — begun under the 1833 appropriation and extended every open
season afterwards. They are the first structures in this dataset that are neither a
building nor a crossing: a line of timber cribs, sunk on the lake bed and filled with
stone, standing in open water with a working deck a few feet above it.

`docs/EPOCHS.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md` both make the point this module depends on:
**piers are STRUCTURES WITH PHASES, not terrain.** A pier that is 700 ft long at the
end of 1834 and 1,260 ft at the end of 1835 is one identity in two states, and the
state is what a phase carries.

## What is actually documented, and what this module therefore refuses to default

Very little, and the little there is comes apart under examination:

- **Length.** Andreas gives the north pier at 1,260 ft "to twelve feet of water" at
  the close of the 1835 season, and the south pier "extended 500 ft in 1835, total
  700 ft"; Wikipedia's *Chicago River* summary gives 200 ft (south) and 700 ft
  (north) at the end of 1834. **No source reached gives a length for any date inside
  the 1835 season.** So a length for 1835-07-01 is an INTERPOLATION between two
  year-end figures, it is `inferred` on the record with the arithmetic written out,
  and there is deliberately no default for it here. A parameter module that
  defaulted a pier's length would be inventing the one number this archetype exists
  to be honest about.
- **Deck height.** `docs/research/01-terrain-hydrology.md` zone 24 gives "deck ~+4
  to +6" ft above the water and cites nothing for it. `DEFAULT_DECK_HEIGHT_M` below
  is the middle of that band and the records tag it `inferred` for exactly that
  reason.
- **Width.** Nothing. Not one source reached states how wide either pier was, and
  **the master survey cannot supply it either**: at Wright 1834's ~1:7,200 a 25-ft
  crib is a fifth of a pen width, so the red pier lines on that sheet carry a
  direction and a position and no thickness at all. `DEFAULT_WIDTH_M` is this
  archetype's own number, records state it `conjectural`, and it owes
  `docs/LIBERTIES.md` an entry.
- **Crib module.** How long each individual crib box was is a builder's convenience
  that no witness would record, so — following the repair `bridge_timber` made when
  `pier_spacing_m` put fifteen supports under a bridge that had two — it is NOT a
  record attribute. It is `CRIB_MODULE_FALLBACK_M`, an archetype constant, and every
  pier built through it inherits an invention that owes the liberties document an
  entry rather than a confidence chip.

## The one thing that IS measured: the line

The alignment is not a guess. Wright 1834 draws the harbour as two red lines with
HARBOR lettered between them, and both lines can be read through the same fitted
affine that `tools/rederive_datum.py` checks the datum against. Read that way the two
drafted pier faces run at **103.4 degrees** and stand **64.2 m** apart — against a
documented entrance width of 200 ft (61.0 m), which is a four-per-cent agreement from
a completely independent direction and is the check that says the right two lines were
read.

What the same sheet does NOT supply is a length: both drafted lines run about 1,165 ft,
which is longer than the north pier was at the end of 1834 (700 ft) and far longer
than the south pier ever was before 1837. Wright drew the harbour as authorised, not
as built. That is recorded on both records and it is why the drafted line is used for
bearing and root and never for extent.

## GROUND_CONTACT is `ends`, and the declaration is half right on purpose

`tools/validate.py` asks every archetype that declares `GROUND_CONTACT` whether its
structures reach the ground under them, and offers two modes: `perimeter` for a
building that meets the terrain all the way round its outline, and `ends` for a
crossing that lands at both ends of its span. **A pier is neither.** It lands at ONE
end — the root, where it leaves the shore — and its other end is open water by
definition. There is no one-ended mode, and inventing one means editing a shared gate
to suit a single archetype.

`ends` is declared anyway, and here is exactly what that buys and costs today. Both
piers in this dataset sit between local E +1216 and E +1589, against a heightfield
that stops at E +320, so `unlanded_values` short-circuits on its `field.covers`
test before it measures anything: the finding is `outside_modelled_ground`, which is
true of both ends and is the honest answer. The declaration therefore makes the piers
VISIBLE to the gate — which declaring nothing would not — and the seaward end costs
nothing while there is no ground anywhere near it.

**It will cost something when `docs/ROADMAP.md` S2e lands** and the terrain box
reaches the harbour. At that point the root will be measured against real ground,
correctly, and the seaward end will be measured against whatever the extended field
puts under open lake — and the gate will ask for `approach_not_modelled` on a pier
head standing in twelve feet of water, which is not a finding about anything. The
right repair then is a `root` mode in the checker, taking only the minimum-u edge.
Written down here rather than left for someone to rediscover.

    **Bearing, and why `v0_m` exists.** The thing that is measured off Wright 1834 is
    the pier's INNER (channel) face — the line the draughtsman drew with the harbour
    lettered against it. So that is the line a record's `position` names, and the crib
    is built to one side of it: north of it for the north pier, south of it for the
    south pier. Rather than move the recorded position by a width nobody measured,
    the footprint polygon simply runs from `v0_m` to `v0_m + width_m`, which is
