"""frame_storefront — a frame store: a shopfront on the street, a loading side, an ell.

The building type 1835 Chicago was mostly made of and the one this project could not
model until now: every mercantile record had to be a log cabin, a frame tavern or a
bridge. The cases it was written for are P. F. W. Peck's two-storey frame store at
South Water & LaSalle with its unfinished loft, Philo Carpenter's "small store" a
block west, and Thomas Church's two-storey frame store on Lake Street. Evidence and
its gaps: docs/research/04-structures-south.md §5, §6, §12, and the parameter
module's docstring, which is where the reasoning for each parameter lives.

**Orientation.** The facade faces NORTH at rotation_deg 0, per the pinned convention
in docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md. In Blender that is the +y face, because the exporter's
`export_yup=True` maps Blender +Y to glTF -Z, which the contract defines as north.
The shopfront, its fascia and its sign are all on +y; the loading end is a gable, +x
unless an end ell has taken that end. Getting this wrong is a silent error — the
building looks right and faces the wrong way.

**The shopfront is a hole, not a decal.** Every other opening in this project's
archetypes is a surface sitting a centimetre proud of the wall, because at this LOD a
real opening would show the inside of the far wall and interiors are out of scope.
The shopfront is the exception and it is worth the geometry: the front elevation is
built AROUND it, the glazing and the door sit back by the thickness of the wall, and
the jambs are modelled. That reveal is the balloon frame made visible — a 4 in stud,
a 1 in board of sheathing and a clapboard come to about five and a half inches, so a
balloon-framed shopfront reads as an opening cut in a thin light wall, which is what
it was. A shopfront drawn flat on the wall reads as a painted sign of a shop.

**The sign board carries nothing.** `sign` names what the board carried so the
sidecar can report it; no lettering, device or image is drawn. Same call, same
reason, as docs/LIBERTIES.md L25 makes for the painted wolf at Wolf Point: firm names
survive from newspaper advertisements, which are not sign boards, and a shop sign
lettered from imagination would be the most conspicuous invention on the street.

**Winding.** Every face here is wound so its normal points out of the building or
away from the wall it sits on, including the cladding lips — the contract says
counter-clockwise and outward, and the exporter's default `doubleSided: true` is not
a guarantee to build on. `_panel` and `_flat` exist so no surface can get it wrong by
hand.
