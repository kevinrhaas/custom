"""Parameters for the outbuilding archetype — pure Python, NO bpy import.

Same split, and for the same reason, as frame_tavern_params: tools/check.sh imports
this module on every commit to prove that every scene-included record still resolves
into buildable parameters, and it has to do that in a bare Python 3.11 with no Blender
in the sandbox.

## What this archetype is for

A frontier town is mostly outbuildings. The eight buildings currently in the 1835
scene are all public houses, stores and a bridge, and behind every one of them the
sources put things this dataset has no archetype for: "the large stable and the yard
into which the trains were driven" behind the Western Hotel (chicagology_prefire278,
docs/research/03-structures-north.md §2.6); the Cook County tavern schedule of 13 April
1831 — "Keeping horse one night 50" — which is a stable stated as a price
(NOTE: this file previously quoted a "13 cents to stable a horse" tariff. That
sentence does not exist in any source this project holds; it was the MAN's 12 1/2
cent lodging rate carried across to the horse. Corrected 2026-08-11.)
(drloih_wolf_point, §2.1); du Sable's "numerous outbuildings" and the Kinzie group's
"dairy, bakehouse, stables, and lodging rooms for the French engages"
(kinzie_waubun_1856, §3.3 — that group is gone by 1835, but it is what the type looked
like here); Beaubien converting "an earlier cabin to a barn" beside the fort
(andreas_1884_v1, docs/research/04-structures-south.md §4); Clybourn's log
slaughterhouse and its stockyard on the north branch (§3.6); and a town code of
November 1833 that forbids pigs to wander the streets (chicagology_prefire278), which
documents pigs and therefore pens.

None of those is dimensioned. Not one source describes the *fabric* of any outbuilding
at the forks — no material, no roof, no size. So this module's defaults are conventions
and are labelled as such throughout, and a record that states nothing gets `conjectural`
for everything by the normal rule (an attribute absent from `form` has no confidence
entry, and `conf()` falls back to conjectural), which is the honest rendering.

## It is a FAMILY, and the family is what the parameters are shaped around

A privy is 1.2 m square and a livery stable is twenty metres long. One set of
proportions cannot serve both — a fixed 2.5 m wall makes the privy a tower and the
stable a crawlspace; a fixed 0.25 m eave overhang is a tenth of the privy's plan on
each side and reads as a mushroom; a fixed 35 degree shed pitch puts 4.9 m of rise on
a 7 m deep wagon shed and builds a ski jump. So the dimensional defaults are FUNCTIONS
of the footprint (`default_wall_height_m`, `default_roof_type`, `default_roof_pitch_deg`),
and the validator checks the *consequences* — the shed roof's absolute rise against the
wall it stands on, the door's width against the wall it is cut into — rather than only
the angles and the lengths in isolation. A range check that passes at both ends and
lies in the middle is the failure this module is written against.

Three axes carry the family:

- **construction** — `log`, `plank` (sawn boards nailed on vertically, gaps and all)
  or `light_frame` (boards laid horizontally on a stick frame). Not
  `balloon_frame`/`braced_frame`: what is behind the boards of a shed is invisible at
  this LOD and no source states it for any outbuilding here, so the vocabulary says
  only what a viewer can see. `log` is refused an open side — a notched log pen is
  held up by its corners, and a wall you remove is a corner you remove.
- **roof_type** — `shed` is first class, not a fallback. A single-slope roof is at
  least as common as a gable on this class of building, and the archetype derives which
  way it falls from the open sides rather than taking a parameter for it (see
  `shed_high_side`): a wagon shed is open on its TALL side, because that is the side a
  loaded wagon can drive through.
- **open_sides** — the wagon shed and the hay shelter are posts and a roof. Any subset
  of the four elevations, including all four.

## What it deliberately does not cover

**The yard.** docs/LIBERTIES.md L10 admits that the Western Hotel's stable *and* its
wagon yard are attested and unbuilt, and this archetype can discharge only the first
half. A yard is an enclosure — a fence line, two gateways and the ground between them —
and building it out of an outbuilding would mean calling a fence a building. L10 should
be revised to narrow its claim, not resolved, until something models enclosures.

**A raised floor.** A corn crib standing clear of the ground on blocks is real and is
not built: `GROUND_CONTACT` below is `perimeter`, which is the claim that the whole
footprint outline meets the terrain at the base of the walls, and a crib on blocks
does not. A crib is buildable here as what a crib mainly is — a slatted box with wide
air gaps between its boards, which is what `board_gap_m` is for — sitting on its sill
at grade. The blocks are the liberty and a record that wants them needs an archetype
that can say so.

**Interiors.** No stalls, no mangers, no seat. Openings are surfaces, not holes, exactly
as in log_dwelling.
