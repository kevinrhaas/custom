"""Parameters for the frame_storefront archetype — pure Python, NO bpy import.

Same split, and for the same reason, as frame_tavern_params and log_dwelling_params:
tools/check.sh imports this module on every commit to prove that every scene-included
record still resolves into buildable parameters, and it has to do that in a bare
Python 3.11 with no Blender in the sandbox.

## What this archetype has to cover

The 1835 town was a boom town of **stores**, and until this module existed every
mercantile record in the dataset had to be a log cabin, a frame tavern or a bridge.
The buildings it was written for are the ones the dossiers actually describe — see
docs/research/04-structures-south.md §5, §6 and §12, and §2.4 and §3.10 of
docs/research/03-structures-north.md:

- **P. F. W. Peck's store**, SW corner South Water & LaSalle, 1832-33 — "two-story
  frame", with an "unfinished loft" a visiting minister lodged in. Dry goods,
  hardware and groceries, so goods arrived by wagon and left over a counter. This
  is the type specimen: two storeys, a loft, a shopfront and a way in for freight.
- **Philo Carpenter's store**, South Water between LaSalle and Wells, summer 1833 —
  he "erected a small store". His earlier shop was a 16 x 20 ft log building, so
  "small" here means small. The degenerate case: one room, one shop opening, no ell,
  no loading door, and the archetype has to reduce to it without looking unfinished.
- **Thomas Church's store**, Lake Street — "the first store building on Lake Street,
  a two-story frame structure". Corroborates two-storey frame as the type.
- **Brewster, Hogan & Co.'s store** at Franklin & South Water, and the log store at
  Lake & South Water that this project already models as `log_dwelling` — the only
  attested STORE FOOTPRINT in the dataset is that log one, 20 x 45 ft, which is what
  the plan ranges below are shaped against: a long frontage on a shallow plan.
- **Robert A. Kinzie's storehouse** at Wolf Point, "dealing in groceries and Indian
  goods" — construction unattested, and the reason `shopfront` is a parameter that
  can be turned off rather than something the archetype always builds.

South Water lots were **55 ft wide** (Andreas), which is the frontage this archetype
is proportioned for; a store filled its lot side to side and was shallow.

## What is different about a store, and where each difference comes from

1. **A shopfront** — one composed ground-floor opening much wider than a dwelling's
   door: a door plus display/counter windows behind a continuous sill, framed by
   pilaster boards and capped by a fascia. THE COMPOSITION IS THE ARCHETYPE'S. No
   source reached describes a Chicago shop window in 1835. What is attested is the
   trade, the counter and the street frontage; the rest is type, and it is the
   liberty this archetype is most exposed on.
2. **A goods entrance** on a loading side — a store that advertises "dry goods,
   groceries and hardware" and calls itself a forwarding and commission house takes
   freight off a wagon, and not through the shop door. Unattested per building, so
   it defaults to `conjectural` and dithers unless a record says otherwise.
3. **A rear or side ell** — the working half: storeroom, counting room, kitchen.
   Carved OUT of the footprint, never bolted onto the outside of it, so the building
   stays inside the polygon the record attests (log_dwelling's rule, and the better
   one — frame_tavern's log wing projects past its own footprint).
4. **Balloon framing.** See below; it is the reason this archetype exists in the
   form it does rather than being frame_tavern with a wider door.

## Balloon framing is a first-class parameter, not a label

1833-35 Chicago is where balloon framing was invented, and docs/ROADMAP.md S4 names
it as the first thing a knowledgeable viewer checks. St. Mary's church, built at Lake
& State in October 1833 by Augustine D. Taylor, is the early example the dossier
records (docs/research/04-structures-south.md §6).

`construction` therefore **moves geometry here**, which is the difference between
this archetype and its siblings: in `frame_tavern` the same attribute is declared
CONSUMED, resolves into a parameter, and then changes nothing a visitor can see.
What the two systems show on a finished elevation:

| | balloon_frame | braced_frame |
|---|---|---|
| corner | a thin applied BOARD, ~4 in | a 6 in POST standing in the wall |
| 2nd floor | nothing: studs run sill to plate | a girt line — the frame is storeyed |
| module | 2x4 studs at **16 in centres** | posts at ~8 ft, studs between |
| wall | 4 in stud + 1 in sheathing + siding, which is every reveal's depth |

The stud rhythm cannot be seen through finished siding, so it reaches the mesh two
ways. Always: every opening on the elevation is set out on the 16 in module, which is
what "proportions" means in the ROADMAP line and is visible whether or not anyone can
count studs. And, when a record says the building was unfinished, `framing_exposed`
leaves the loading gable open — studs at their true centres over horizontal board
sheathing, which is the one place the rhythm can literally be counted. That state is
attested in kind rather than invented: Andreas has John Calhoun taking a building at
South Water & Clark for the *Chicago Democrat* in November 1833 "which was unfinished
at the time", and Peck's loft was unfinished in 1833 as well.

## What it deliberately does not cover

A store built of logs is a `log_dwelling` — Hogan's store is recorded that way, and
which side of that line a building falls on is a research judgement that belongs in
the record's `archetype`, not in a parameter. Brick is excluded from 1835 by date on
the south side (the first brick house is 1837), so this archetype refuses it rather
than quietly substituting a wall.

# would be stating something the mesh does not contain, and tools/validate.py holds
# every such attribute to a `geometry:` declaration on the record.
#
# Reading an attribute's CONFIDENCE is deliberately not membership. `fenestration`
# tints the upper-storey windows with the record's confidence while their number
# comes from the frontage and their rhythm from the framing module, and a tint is

# states about the building — and those two live in the record's `reconstruction`
# block, the 665-roof programme's own ledger, one level above the phase. That is why
# no archetype could read them for as long as `from_phase` took only a phase, and it
