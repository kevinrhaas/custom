"""Parameters for the frame_tavern archetype — pure Python, NO bpy import.

This module is imported by tools/check.sh on every commit to validate that every
structure record can actually be resolved into generator parameters. It must stay
importable in a bare Python 3.11 with no Blender, no numpy, nothing.

The split matters: parameter validation is a per-commit concern that has to run in
seconds in every agent sandbox, while mesh generation is a content-build concern
that runs on demand with a pinned Blender. Keeping the params here is what makes
that split possible.
