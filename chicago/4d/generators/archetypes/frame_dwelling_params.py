"""Parameters for the frame_dwelling archetype — pure Python, NO bpy import.

Same split, and for the same reason, as frame_tavern_params and log_dwelling_params:
tools/check.sh imports this module on every commit to prove that every scene-included
record still resolves into buildable parameters, and it has to do that in a bare
Python 3.11 with no Blender in the sandbox.

## What this archetype is for, and how it differs from frame_tavern

A HOUSE, not a public house. `frame_tavern` was written for the Sauganash and carries
its evidence: a two-storey block with a regular five-bay front, a gallery question, and
a bar-room's worth of frontage. Almost nothing a family lived in at Chicago in 1835
looked like that, and until this archetype existed every frame record had to be one of
those or a log cabin — which is why the dataset holds three taverns, three log
buildings, a store and a bridge, and no dwellings at all.

The distinguishing parameters, and where each comes from:

- **`stories` takes 1, 1.5 or 2, and defaults to 1.5.** The story-and-a-half — a full
  storey with chambers in the roof lit from the gable ends over a low knee wall — is
  the characteristic form of these years and the reason `knee_wall_m` exists. The
  dataset's own attestation for the half storey is the Green Tree, where John Gray
  remembered "a small attic window in the gable end, for we used the attic, too"
  (`chicagology_prefire127`), and P. F. W. Peck's store on South Water, whose
  "unfinished loft" Rev. Jeremiah Porter lodged in (`andreas_1884_v1`, scan p. 627).
  Both are the half storey in use; neither is a dormer, and this archetype does not
  build one — see the note on `stories` below.
- **`wall_height_m` is short.** Chicago's one attested ceiling height is the Green
  Tree's seven and a half feet, which the page's own editor calls "rather low for a
  hotel ceiling" (`chicagology_prefire127`). A house was not taller than a hotel, so
  the defaults here are built up from 2.29 m of ceiling plus floor structure rather
  than from a modern storey.
- **`ell` is a plan fact and comes out of the FOOTPRINT**, not out of an invented
  width and depth. `from_phase` reads the wing off an L-shaped footprint polygon and
  refuses a record whose `ell` and whose polygon disagree. The reasoning is the lesson
  docs/ROADMAP.md draws from the North Branch bridge: ask for the kind of number a
  source could contain. No source will ever state a rear wing's width in metres; what
  a source states is exactly what chicagology states about the Western Hotel — "The
  front was about forty feet and the wing sixty feet. It was in an L." That is a
  polygon, and this archetype takes it as one.
- **`porch` is a stoop or a small roofed porch over the door — never the tavern's
  full-front gallery.** A gallery is a public-house feature and `frame_tavern` owns
  it; a record needing one is a tavern record.
- **`plan` and `bays` decide the facade, and they are the point.** See below.

## Balloon framing is a parameter here, not a label

1833-35 Chicago is where balloon framing was invented (St Mary's church, Augustine D.
Taylor, 1833 — `andreas_1884_v1` scan pp. 281, 601), and docs/ROADMAP.md S4 names stud
spacing, sheathing and proportion as the first thing a knowledgeable viewer checks. In
`frame_tavern` and in every structure record so far, `construction` is a value nothing
reads: its own note says the distinction "changes stud rhythm behind the sheathing and
is not visible at this level of detail". Here it moves vertices, three ways:

1. **The module.** `stud_spacing_m` is 16 in for a balloon frame and 24 in for a
   braced one, and every opening's centre lands on a stud-bay centre so its jambs sit
   against studs. The rhythm of the wall is the rhythm of the frame even where the
   studs themselves are behind the sheathing.
2. **The girt.** A braced frame carries a girt at the upper floor and the siding
   shows it; a balloon frame's studs run in one piece from sill to plate and there is
   no line there at all. That is the single most legible exterior difference between
   the two systems, and the generator builds it or omits it accordingly.
3. **The corner.** A braced frame has a heavy corner post to box; a balloon frame has
   a light corner board. The trim width follows the construction.

What is NOT modelled is the studs themselves, because on a finished clapboarded house
they are behind the sheathing and a viewer cannot see them either. The generator does
model the one place the frame reaches the surface: clapboard butt joints fall on stud
lines, staggered course to course, which is what a knowledgeable eye actually reads off
a wall.

## The fenestration problem this archetype exists partly to fix

docs/LIBERTIES.md **L23** records that `fenestration` is stated on all three frame
taverns and read by none of them, so three buildings of different sizes wear one
five-bay front. Its stated resolution is "a bay-count parameter derived from frontage,
and records that state a rhythm rather than a glazing type". That is `bays` and `plan`:

- `bays` is the number of openings across the front, DERIVED from the frontage on a
  period bay module when a record does not state it, and read when it does.
- `plan` names the room arrangement behind the wall, which is what actually decides
  where the door goes. `hall_parlour` — the default, and the commonest vernacular plan
  — puts the door in the middle of the larger room, so the front is asymmetric and the
  openings are unevenly spaced with a wider gap at the partition. `centre_passage` is
  the symmetrical alternative and has to be asked for by name.

The default therefore produces a plainer and less regular front than the taverns', on
purpose. A whole-scene critic reading the existing frame buildings as 1850s Greek
Revival — two-storey clapboard, entablature, corner pilasters, twelve evenly spaced
6-over-6 windows — was reading a real problem: the earliest Greek Revival house in
Chicago is the Clarke House of **1836**, which `data/exclusions.json` already excludes
from this scene by date. A dwelling of 1835 is a year earlier and much plainer than
that, and nothing in this module builds an entablature, a pilaster or a regular front
unless a record asks for one.

#   `fenestration`  — its CONFIDENCE tints the openings, but `plan` and `bays` are
#                     what decide where they go. A glazing type is not a rhythm, which
#                     is the finding docs/LIBERTIES.md L23 records;
#   the ell's arms  — `ell_width_m` and `ell_depth_m` are not form attributes at all
