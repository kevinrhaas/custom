"""Where the openings are on a building's front wall — the one place that answers it.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (T-0459). The owner reported, from the dev preview, that
signboards sit over doors and over windows on walls with blank face going spare;
the Sauganash Hotel's board hangs across a window bay. The cause was not a bad
rule, it was a MISSING INPUT: `tools/generate_business_signboards.py` mentions
doors sixteen times and not once as geometry. Every mention is trade reasoning —
*"lodging is sold to arrivals who have to find the door"* — and the generator
reasoned carefully about which door a board belonged beside while having no idea
where any of them were. So a board was placed at a height and an offset that
suited the trade, and whatever was behind it was behind it.

WHAT IT IS. A Blender-free reader of the archetypes' own set-out. Each archetype's
`*_params` module now states its front elevation's rectangles from the same shared
constants the builder draws them with, and this module composes those into one
answer — so a board placed clear of these rectangles is placed clear of the
geometry a visitor sees. They live in the params modules for the reason
`shopfront_head_z` always has: the commit gate has to read them and the commit gate
has no Blender.

WHAT IS NOT DONE YET, said plainly. The BUILDER does not yet call these functions;
it still computes the same rectangles inline, so the two are two copies of one
arithmetic. Making the builders consume this is T-0520, and it is a separate ticket
because the asset staleness hash covers each builder module byte for byte: editing
three of them stales 212 assets and demands a town-wide rebake. Until that lands,
an opening moved in a builder must be moved here in the same commit.

THE FRAME. `u` runs along the front wall from the footprint polygon's own origin;
`z` is metres above the base of the walls, the datum `buildings.js` sets and the
one the signage record already measures `arm_height_m` in. The archetypes build
their front elevation on the footprint's max-v edge and so does
`_front_edge` in the sign generator, so the two frames are the same frame and no
transform is needed. `u0`/`u1` are the extent of REAL WALL on that plane, which is
not always the footprint's full width: a log dwelling with a front addition faces
the town with a block narrower than its own footprint.

An archetype with no rule here returns None rather than an empty list, and the
difference matters: an empty list says "this wall is blank", None says "nobody
has read this wall yet", and a caller must not hang a board flat on the second.
