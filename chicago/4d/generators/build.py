    same number survives into the exported file.

    OFF BY DEFAULT, and that is a considered choice rather than an oversight.
    AO is the largest visible quality gain available on plain frame buildings,
    which is why this pipeline uses Blender at all — but it only works on
    geometry built for it. These archetypes model clapboard courses, window
    reveals and shutters as thin surfaces sitting a centimetre off the wall, and
    every one of them occludes its neighbours.

    **The figures this docstring used to quote were wrong twice over — T-0158.**
    "Mean 0.265, 69 % of texels below half" was (a) read off an sRGB-tagged buffer,
    so it was the sRGB-ENCODED occlusion rather than the occlusion, and (b) taken
    over the whole 512x512 atlas, **68.9 % of which is empty UV space** — so most
    of what it counted was blank, not dark, and the 69 % is very nearly the empty
    fraction itself. Re-measured on `sauganash_hotel` from the exported file:
    atlas-wide raw mean 0.1665, and over the 81,458 texels the unwrap actually
    writes, **mean 0.5358 with 58.7 % below half**. The "0.38 at a 0.25 m AO
    distance" figure carries both faults and has NOT been re-measured.

    The shape of the problem is unchanged — more than half the written surface sits
    below half occlusion, on a building whose white paint is DOCUMENTED — but no
    judgement about it should rest on the old numbers, and none of them was ever
    taken from a file that carried the occlusion at all (T-0208 asks the question
    properly, now that one can).

    The fix, when someone picks this up, is a low-poly AO cage — bake the massing
    only, and let the decorative surfaces inherit it — not a stronger denoiser.
    Until then `--ao` exists so the path stays exercised, and the manifest records
    honestly whether any given asset actually carries AO.

    ## The order of the two lines below is the whole of T-0158

    `colorspace_settings.name` is set BEFORE the bake and must stay there. Setting
    it on a GENERATED image that has no file behind it and is not packed frees the
    image buffer, which regenerates from `generated_color` — black — and clears
    `is_dirty`, which is the flag Blender's own exporter tests in
    `make_temp_image_copy()` before it will carry unsaved pixels across. Doing it
    after the bake therefore destroyed the data AND switched off the exporter's
    only rescue path, and shipped a uniformly black occlusion texture that glTF
    reads as FULLY OCCLUDED while `assets/manifest.json` recorded `baked_ao: true`.
    Measured on `sauganash_hotel`, 512x512, 48 samples: after the bake mean 0.2158
    in memory, in the GLB min 0 max 0 over 262,144 texels. With the tag set first:
    0.1665 in memory, 0.1665 in the GLB, 0.0 % drift.

    Non-Color rather than sRGB, and not merely to dodge the wipe: `Image.pixels`
    on an 8-bit buffer is raw in both directions, so the tag decides what the bake
    WRITES. Under sRGB it stores the sRGB-encoded occlusion; glTF samples an
    occlusion texture as `byte / 255` with no transfer decode, so that file was
    already ~30 % too bright before it went black.
