"""The material sheet, as code — `docs/RESEARCH/materials.md` wired into the town.

R-W2a measured 1,353 material slots out of the shipped GLBs and wrote them up as a
document. The document reached nothing: every colour and every roughness in this
project was still a literal sitting in whichever module happened to paint that
surface, and two generators — the nine Blender archetypes and the pure-Python
`inferred_placeholder` — carried two palettes that shared not one value. T-0007 is
the parcel that makes the sheet the source. This module IS the sheet: every row
below is a row of materials.md §1.1 or §2, and every archetype and the placeholder
generator now read their colours and their roughness from here rather than from a
constant of their own.

## What a row is

A surface is TWO things, and keeping them apart is what lets the sheet describe a
whitewashed clapboard wall without a combinatorial table:

* a **substrate** — what the wall is made OF. It owns the roughness, the tiling rate
  and the dimensional module that rate is a whole multiple of (materials.md §3.2:
  every tile is 32 clapboard courses, or 12 log courses, or 20 sheathing boards, so
  the seam lands on the surface's own rhythm rather than on a number chosen to look
  right). No substrate owns a colour.
* a **finish** — what it WEARS. It owns the colour, and the three coating finishes
  own a roughness too, because materials.md §2.1 argues them explicitly: a limewashed
  wall is the flattest surface in the town, and lead paint the only smooth one. §2.1
  calls those three "overlay, not a tile" for exactly this reason — they modify the
  substrate's value and gloss and leave its rhythm showing through.

So `resolve(substrate, finish)` gives the pair the exporter needs, and the tile rate
sits beside it for the bake half to draw its atlas against the same numbers.

## COLOUR SPACE — materials.md §3.4's one process rule

**Every value here is LINEAR**, which is what glTF `baseColorFactor` means and what a
Blender node colour is. The six wall finishes and the four roof conditions are
written as hex because that is the form `inferred_placeholder.py` committed them in,
and materials.md §3.4 proved from the whitewash pair that they were authored as
linear values rather than sRGB ones — read as sRGB the two generators' whitewash
would sit 40 % apart in blue instead of 12.6 %. `hex_rgba` therefore divides by 255
and does nothing else, and this paragraph is the "state the space in the file that
holds it" §3.4 asks for. A PNG atlas is sRGB by convention; the bake half has to
convert, and this is the sentence that tells it so.

## THE ROOF COVERING — what was open, what was misread, and what is now claimed

This file used to say, under the heading WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED HERE, that **no source in
this repository states what any Chicago roof of 1835 was covered with**, and therefore
that there was no `shingle` row and no `roof_board` row. That sentence was read for a
year as the reason the roofs could not be given a material, and `outbuilding.py`,
`frame_dwelling.py` and `frame_storefront.py` each quote it back in a comment beside a
roughness literal they declined to choose.

**It overstated its own research.** What `docs/RESEARCH/materials.md` §2.2 grades is
narrower and more permissive than the summary above:

| substrate | evidence | grade |
|---|---|---|
| `shingle` | the one direct attestation in the repository — the North Side school of 1833, *"a frame building twenty-six by thirty-eight feet; twelve-foot posts; sheeted and shingled roof"* | **attested** for that building; **inferred** as the ordinary covering of a framed building here |
| `roof_board` | `outbuilding.py`: *"a shingle field on an outbuilding would be claiming a finish"* | **inferred, and well argued** |

The covering was never the open question. The open question was the **exposure** — how
much of each shingle the weather sees, and therefore the tiling rate — and §2.2 said
exactly how to close it: *pick the exposure from a source or record a liberty*. **L263
recorded the liberty** on the owner's ruling of 2026-09-20: 0.14 m, the same exposure
this project committed for clapboard at T-0049, giving a 4.48 m tile at 228.6 px/m.

So the two rows are here now, and `roof_plane` survives below them as the fallback for
a roof whose covering is genuinely undecidable — carrying zero records today, and kept
rather than deleted so that a reader can see the question was answered and not removed.
`roof_substrate()` is the dealing rule and states its own argument; **L266** is the
liberty for the part of that rule §2.2 does not grade.

What is still graded by CONDITION and not by material is the roof's **finish** — fresh,
weathered, darkened, patched — which 218 records carry. A covering and a weathering are
two different claims and this file keeps them apart.

Likewise still absent: a brick or stone course dimension. §3.2 says plainly that no
source this project holds gives one, so `brick` and `stone` carry `tile_m = None`
rather than a modern brick quietly chosen to make the arithmetic land. L264 committed a
brick course on the same day L263 committed the shingle exposure and it is NOT wired
here — that is the brick half of T-1450's acceptance and it is still open; this parcel
is the roof half and does not reach into it.

## The blast radius, stated

`generators/mesh_inputs.py` hashes every byte of `generators/common/` into every
archetype's mesh inputs, so an edit here stales the whole town. `frame_tavern.py`
keeps its own two colours for precisely that reason and is right to: a value only one
archetype reads does not belong in a shared file. What is here is the opposite case —
the wall finishes, the roof conditions and the log fabric are read by every building
generator in the project and by the placeholder path as well, and holding one copy of
them is the whole point of a sheet.

# ---------------------------------------------- the bare masonry, and the stack
#
# R-W2a finding 1, discharged by T-0008: `frame_dwelling`, `frame_storefront` and
# `log_dwelling` built their stacks with the ROOF material, so every stack in the town
# was painted the colour of the roof it passes through — wrong in a way a visitor sees
# from the street. Measured off the resolved parameters of the committed masters, that
# is **157 stacks on 143 buildings** counting `frame_tavern`, which took the same fix;
# R-W2a's own "219 on 199" does not reproduce on this tree and is left as it was
# written rather than quietly restated. The fabric question the finding left open is
# answered in `docs/RESEARCH/chimneys.md`, and its answer is TWO materials rather than
# one, because the two stacks are two different objects:
#
# * A FRAMED house's stack rises inside the building and breaks the roof at the ridge.
#   It has to be masonry to do that, and the masonry Chicago had is brick: Blodgett's
#   brick-yard opened on the North Side in the spring of 1833 (`brickyard_north_side`,
#   Andreas), the Lake House went up in brick in 1835, and the one coloured witness to
#   any Chicago stack — the Petford watercolour of the Sauganash, image 8 of the
#   owner's 2026-08-18 brief — paints **brick chimneys** on a framed clapboard block.
#   INFERRED, and the colour is not a new one: it is `frame_tavern`'s committed
#   `BRICK_RGBA`, wired to the Sauganash by T-0092, which now lives here so the town
#   has ONE brick instead of an archetype-local copy per archetype (§2.3's complaint).
# * A LOG cabin's stack stands OUTSIDE the gable, and `log_dwelling._stack` has always
#   said why in as many words: a stick-and-clay or fieldstone stack built against the
#   wall can be pulled away from the building when it catches fire. Nothing in this
#   repository attests any log house's stack, so this is RECONSTRUCTED — the daub the
#   sticks are laid up in, BOUNDED between the chinking it is made of and the palest
#   roof it stands beside, and sitting at the midpoint because nothing says where else
#   it sits. `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L26 owns every stack's POSITION; L168 owns its fabric.
#
# Neither row claims a stack for a building whose record does not count one, and
# neither is a covering claim about the roof it passes through.

# T-0332 RENAMED THIS ROW, AND THE RENAME IS THE WHOLE OF THAT TICKET. It was
# `CHIMNEY_BRICK` from T-0008, when a stack was the only thing in the town made of
# brick. T-0267 brought the fort's wall onto it and T-0092's tavern stack was already
# on it, so one row named for one surface was being read by three, two of them
# attested brick WALLS and neither of them a chimney. The name is now the FABRIC —
# which is what a material sheet row is — and the surfaces ask for it through the two
# selectors below rather than naming it, so nothing has to be renamed again the next
# time a third kind of brick surface arrives. materials.md §9.5 filed it; §10 closes
# it. No alias is kept: three call sites is not a compatibility surface, and a sheet
# carrying two names for one row is the drift this rename exists to end.
#
# The VALUE is untouched, to the last decimal, and that is the check on the parcel:
# a rename that repaints a building is the wrong change.

    building takes a shingle field.** What follows is why, and which half of it is
    graded and which half is a liberty, because those are not the same and a reader
    should not have to work out which is which.

    **The board half is §2.2's and is not new.** `outbuilding.py` has argued since it
    was written that "a shingle field on an outbuilding would be claiming a finish",
    and `docs/RESEARCH/materials.md` §2.2 grades `roof_board` inferred and well
    argued on exactly that reasoning. A privy, a stable, a wagon shed and a smokehouse
    are built of what is to hand and roofed to keep the rain off a thing, not a
    family. 130 phases.

    **The shingle half is §2.2's for the framed buildings** — the North Side school of
    1833 is the one direct attestation in the repository, and §2.2 grades a shingled
    covering inferred as the ordinary covering of a framed building here. That reaches
    `frame_dwelling` (128), `frame_storefront` (42) and `frame_tavern` (12).

    **And it is L266 for the rest**, which is the part worth being explicit about. The
    rule above also gives a shingle field to the 49 `log_dwelling` cabins and the 14
    `fort_structure` garrison buildings, and §2.2 grades shingle for a FRAMED building
    — not for a log one. The claim being made is that the two coverings this project
    can argue split on what the roof is FOR and not on what the walls are made of: the
    board roof is argued as the shed's, and a log cabin is not a shed, it is a dwelling
    that has to carry a family through a Chicago winter and it meets the same demand
    the framed dwelling's roof meets. That is an argument, not a source, so it takes an
    L-number — L266 — and a reader who asks why a cabin is shingled finds it there.

    that and the two are kept apart. It is not a colour: no substrate owns one (§1.1).

    T-0092, which `frame_tavern` still reads and folds into its confidence). What the
    two rows above argue is a rule about the two kinds of stack this town has, and
    each archetype already knows which kind it builds — `frame_dwelling` says its
    stack rises inside the wall and breaks the roof at the ridge, `log_dwelling` says
    its stack is built against the gable so it can be pulled away when it fires. Those
    two sentences were already committed; this turns them into two materials.

    Anything else takes brick: an interior stack is the town's majority and the
    better-evidenced of the two. `docs/RESEARCH/chimneys.md` is the whole argument.
