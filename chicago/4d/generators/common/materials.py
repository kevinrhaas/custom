"""The material sheet, as code — `docs/RESEARCH/materials.md` wired into the town.

R-W2a measured 1,353 material slots out of the shipped GLBs and wrote them up as a
document. The document reached nothing: every colour and every roughness in this
project was still a literal sitting in whichever module happened to paint that
surface, and two generators — the nine Blender archetypes and the pure-Python
`inferred_placeholder` — carried two palettes that shared not one value. T-0007 is
the parcel that makes the sheet the source. This module IS the sheet: every row
below is a row of materials.md §1.1 or §2, and every archetype and the placeholder
generator now read their colours and their roughness from here rather than from a
constant of their own.

## What a row is

A surface is TWO things, and keeping them apart is what lets the sheet describe a
whitewashed clapboard wall without a combinatorial table:

* a **substrate** — what the wall is made OF. It owns the roughness, the tiling rate
  and the dimensional module that rate is a whole multiple of (materials.md §3.2:
  every tile is 32 clapboard courses, or 12 log courses, or 20 sheathing boards, so
  the seam lands on the surface's own rhythm rather than on a number chosen to look
  right). No substrate owns a colour.
* a **finish** — what it WEARS. It owns the colour, and the three coating finishes
  own a roughness too, because materials.md §2.1 argues them explicitly: a limewashed
  wall is the flattest surface in the town, and lead paint the only smooth one. §2.1
  calls those three "overlay, not a tile" for exactly this reason — they modify the
  substrate's value and gloss and leave its rhythm showing through.

So `resolve(substrate, finish)` gives the pair the exporter needs, and the tile rate
sits beside it for the bake half to draw its atlas against the same numbers.

## COLOUR SPACE — materials.md §3.4's one process rule

**Every value here is LINEAR**, which is what glTF `baseColorFactor` means and what a
Blender node colour is. The six wall finishes and the four roof conditions are
written as hex because that is the form `inferred_placeholder.py` committed them in,
and materials.md §3.4 proved from the whitewash pair that they were authored as
linear values rather than sRGB ones — read as sRGB the two generators' whitewash
would sit 40 % apart in blue instead of 12.6 %. `hex_rgba` therefore divides by 255
and does nothing else, and this paragraph is the "state the space in the file that
holds it" §3.4 asks for. A PNG atlas is sRGB by convention; the bake half has to
convert, and this is the sentence that tells it so.

## WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED HERE — R-W2a finding 2, and it stands

**No source in this repository states what any Chicago roof of 1835 was covered
with.** 315 records state a roof type and a pitch; zero state a covering. So there is
no `shingle` row in this file and no `roof_board` row, and the roof rows below are
graded by **condition** — fresh, weathered, darkened, patched — which is a statement
about weathering that 218 records actually carry, and not a statement about material.
A future parcel that finds a source for the covering adds the rows then; inventing
one here to make the sheet look finished is the exact move `docs/LIBERTIES.md`
exists to catch. materials.md §2.2 and §5 own the open question.

Likewise absent: the shingle exposure, and a brick or stone course dimension. §3.2
says plainly that no source this project holds gives one, so `brick` and `stone`
carry `tile_m = None` rather than a modern brick quietly chosen to make the
arithmetic land.

## The blast radius, stated

`generators/mesh_inputs.py` hashes every byte of `generators/common/` into every
archetype's mesh inputs, so an edit here stales the whole town. `frame_tavern.py`
keeps its own two colours for precisely that reason and is right to: a value only one
archetype reads does not belong in a shared file. What is here is the opposite case —
the wall finishes, the roof conditions and the log fabric are read by every building
generator in the project and by the placeholder path as well, and holding one copy of
them is the whole point of a sheet.

# ------------------------------------------------------------- the chimney stack
#
# R-W2a finding 1, discharged by T-0008: `frame_dwelling`, `frame_storefront` and
# `log_dwelling` built their stacks with the ROOF material, so every stack in the town
# was painted the colour of the roof it passes through — wrong in a way a visitor sees
# from the street. Measured off the resolved parameters of the committed masters, that
# is **157 stacks on 143 buildings** counting `frame_tavern`, which took the same fix;
# R-W2a's own "219 on 199" does not reproduce on this tree and is left as it was
# written rather than quietly restated. The fabric question the finding left open is
# answered in `docs/RESEARCH/chimneys.md`, and its answer is TWO materials rather than
# one, because the two stacks are two different objects:
#
# * A FRAMED house's stack rises inside the building and breaks the roof at the ridge.
#   It has to be masonry to do that, and the masonry Chicago had is brick: Blodgett's
#   brick-yard opened on the North Side in the spring of 1833 (`brickyard_north_side`,
#   Andreas), the Lake House went up in brick in 1835, and the one coloured witness to
#   any Chicago stack — the Petford watercolour of the Sauganash, image 8 of the
#   owner's 2026-08-18 brief — paints **brick chimneys** on a framed clapboard block.
#   INFERRED, and the colour is not a new one: it is `frame_tavern`'s committed
#   `BRICK_RGBA`, wired to the Sauganash by T-0092, which now lives here so the town
#   has ONE brick instead of an archetype-local copy per archetype (§2.3's complaint).
# * A LOG cabin's stack stands OUTSIDE the gable, and `log_dwelling._stack` has always
#   said why in as many words: a stick-and-clay or fieldstone stack built against the
#   wall can be pulled away from the building when it catches fire. Nothing in this
#   repository attests any log house's stack, so this is RECONSTRUCTED — the daub the
#   sticks are laid up in, BOUNDED between the chinking it is made of and the palest
#   roof it stands beside, and sitting at the midpoint because nothing says where else
#   it sits. `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L26 owns every stack's POSITION; L168 owns its fabric.
#
# Neither row claims a stack for a building whose record does not count one, and
# neither is a covering claim about the roof it passes through.
