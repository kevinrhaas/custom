"""Build honest, pure-Python placeholder GLBs for all inferred anonymous infill.

These are review massings, not substitutes for the repository's Blender archetype
bakes.  The glTF asset declares ``asset.extras.placeholder = true`` so the loader and
provenance card flag that fact from the file itself.  Geometry is still generated
entirely from the committed structure record and follows the normal axis/origin,

# four roof conditions below were written here and read nowhere else, which is
# docs/RESEARCH/materials.md finding 5: 27 % of the town was painted by a generator
# sharing not one colour and not one roughness with the other 73 %. They have moved
# to `common/materials.py` — the sheet — where the nine Blender archetypes now read
# them too, and these names stay as the local view of it. The VALUES are unchanged to
# the last bit, deliberately: 94 committed GLBs are gated on their exact bytes, and
# this parcel converges the two palettes by moving the archetypes onto the records'
# vocabulary rather than by moving the vocabulary.

# and the only one of the four that was GREEN — #2D3D33, a colour nothing in this
# repository argues for and nothing in a Chicago building is. It is pointed at the
# sheet's `DARK` row with the rest of them. NOTE WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT CHANGE:
# `--check` reports "0 flagged placeholder GLBs; 226 superseded by a canonical bake",
# so this generator paints nothing that ships and the edit repaints no building. It
# is here so the divergence cannot walk back in the day a placeholder is emitted
# again, and §2.3's count of four is corrected to the three that were real.
