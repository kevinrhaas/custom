"""What determines a mesh — the hash the staleness gate compares against.

NO bpy import, deliberately. `tools/validate.py` has to recompute this on every
commit in a bare Python 3.11, because a staleness check that only runs where
Blender runs is a check that runs nightly at best, and the commit that breaks
the correspondence is not the commit that discovers it.

## What is hashed, and why it is not "the files that were involved"

The first version of this hash (in `build.py`, replaced by this module) hashed
the phase record, *every* `.py` under `generators/`, and `blender.pin`. It was
never actually compared against anything, and when it finally was, all six
committed buildings came out stale — none of them for a reason that could move a
vertex. Two whole classes of false positive:

- **Record prose.** The phase JSON went in whole, so a `note` rewrite, a new
  source id, or the `geometry:` declarations added on 2026-08-10 all read as
  "the mesh changed". None of them are read by any generator.
- **Unrelated code.** One hash over every generator meant an edit to
  `terrain_gen.py` invalidated the taverns, and a comment added to one
  archetype's parameter module invalidated the other archetypes' buildings.

A hash that cries stale for reasons that cannot change the geometry gets
disbelieved, and a disbelieved gate is worse than no gate: it teaches the reader
that "stale" means nothing. So this one hashes **what the builder can actually
see**:

1. the *resolved* archetype parameters — `from_phase(phase)`, not the phase — so
   only a value the generator reads counts, and it counts after defaulting;
2. every `@property` the parameter class derives from those fields, because
   `addition_height_m`'s 2.55/4.7 constants are as load-bearing as any field;
3. the confidence *floats*, not the labels, so a change to `CONFIDENCE_VALUE`
   registers even though it never appears in a field;
4. the bytes of the code that turns parameters into vertices — this archetype's
   builder, `generators/common/`, `build.py`, and the pinned Blender.

`<arch>_params.py` bytes are deliberately NOT hashed. That module's entire effect
on the mesh is the object it returns, and that object is hashed above in more
detail than its source would give: two params modules that resolve a record
identically produce the same building, and the hash should say so.

The residual is stated rather than papered over: this compares inputs, not
output. Cycles AO is not bit-reproducible across hardware, which is why the
project defines freshness on inputs in the first place; a hand-edited GLB with an
untouched record still passes, and nothing here can catch that.
