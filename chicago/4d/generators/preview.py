"""Render a reference image of an archetype. Run inside Blender:

    blender -b -noaudio --factory-startup --python generators/preview.py -- [args]

    --archetype <name>   log_dwelling | bridge_timber | frame_tavern |
                         frame_dwelling | frame_storefront | outbuilding | all
    --out <dir>          output directory (default docs/RESEARCH)
    --samples <n>        Cycles samples (default 96)
    --width <px>         image width (default 1400)

Why this exists rather than a throwaway script: the committed reference images under
`docs/RESEARCH/archetype-*.png` are the only record of what the generators actually
produce, and an image nobody can regenerate is an image nobody can trust once the code
moves under it. Each archetype's GOLDEN cases below are also the closest thing the
generators have to a fixture — they are the documented buildings, spelled out as
parameters, and running this is the fastest way to find out that a change broke one.

**Cycles on the CPU, always.** EEVEE needs a GL context and dies with a libEGL error in
every headless sandbox this project runs in. Cycles is slower and correct, and a
reference render is not on anyone's inner loop.

The ground is a 1 m checker so heights can be read off the image. There are no figures
in it, per AGENTS.md — the checker is the scale reference instead.
