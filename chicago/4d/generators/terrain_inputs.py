"""What determines the ground — the staleness hash for a terrain epoch.

The building half of this rule lives in `generators/mesh_inputs.py`, and its
docstring explains at length why a hash over "the files that were involved" is
the wrong hash. The ground was left on exactly that hash: whole file bytes of
`terrain_spec.json`, `river.geojson`, `hydrology.geojson`, `datum.json` and
`terrain_gen.py`, concatenated.

So the false positive `mesh_inputs` was written to end was still standing here,
and it was not hypothetical — it was blocking a repair. `terrain_spec.json` is
the only place a terrain claim's reasoning can be written, three `inferred`
claims carried none, and the validator had to warn rather than fail because
adding a sentence of prose to that file reported the ground as stale and could
not land without a Blender bake. A gate that makes writing a note cost a bake is
a gate that stops notes being written.

## What is hashed

1. **The spec, the traced vectors and the datum with their prose removed** — the
   graded numbers, ids, confidences and coordinates, and nothing that only a
   reader consumes. `note`, `*_note`, `_doc`, `label`, `scope`,
   `critical_caveat`, `why` and `sources` are stripped wherever they appear.
   That set is a DENYLIST on purpose: strip prose and everything else counts, so
   a zone, a reach or a watercourse added to the spec tomorrow is a mesh input
   the day it appears. An allowlist of keys the generator reads today would
   silently stop asking about the newest one, which is the failure this family
   of checks exists to prevent.

   `mesh` joins them (scheme `resolved-spec-v2`), and it is the one member of the
   set that is not prose. A `mesh:` declaration states what the ground does with a
   figure the generator does NOT read — `absent`, `simplified`, `record_only`,
   `restated_in_code` — so by its own definition it cannot move a vertex, and
   hashing it would make writing an admission cost a bake for exactly the reason
   writing a note used to. `tools/validate.py` checks it against this generator's
   `CONSUMED` sets.

   **It is called `mesh` and not `geometry`, which is what the structure records
   call it, because `geometry` is already taken and the test caught it on the
   first run.** In a GeoJSON, `geometry` is the feature's coordinates: stripping
   that key would have taken every traced bank line, river ring and slough
   centreline out of the ground's hash — a bank could have been redrawn and the
   committed mesh would still have read fresh. That is the precise opposite of
   what this file is for, and it is the same trap `name` is kept for (a CRS is
   named too). `test_terrain_prose_is_not_read_by_the_generator` is what refused
   it, by scanning the generator for reads of every stripped key.
2. **The bytes of the code that turns the spec into vertices** —
   `terrain_gen.py`, `generators/common/`, and the pinned Blender.

`sources` is stripped for the same reason a `note` is: a citation is an
obligation the record answers to (`check_terrain_claims` enforces it) and it
cannot move a vertex. `name` is deliberately NOT stripped — in a GeoJSON it also
names the CRS, and dropping `crs.properties.name` would take the coordinate
reference system out of the hash to save a feature title.

This file's own bytes are not hashed. It computes the hash and makes no
geometry — the same rule `mesh_inputs` applies to itself.

## The residual, stated rather than papered over

`terrain_gen.py` goes in whole, so a docstring edit in the generator still
re-stales the ground. That is the identical residual the building hash carries on
`build.py`, it is one file rather than a data file every claim has to be written
in, and no repair is queued behind it. It is written down here so the next person
to meet it knows it is known.

And, as on the building side: this compares inputs, not output. A hand-edited GLB
behind an untouched spec passes, and nothing here can see it.

# Per graded block of `terrain_spec.json`, the field keys whose VALUE reaches a
# vertex in `terrain_gen.build_field`. The structure side of this rule is each
# archetype's `CONSUMED` (generators/archetypes/*_params.py) and the argument is
# identical: the confidence model grades how sure we are of a value and says
# nothing about whether the thing was built, so a claim a visitor reads with a
# chip over it may be a claim the mesh does not contain. `tools/validate.py`
# holds every stated figure outside these sets to a `mesh:` declaration on its
# block.
#
# WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT BESIDE THE CODE THAT DOES THE READING, which is where an
# archetype keeps its own: `terrain_gen.py` goes into the ground's hash whole, so
# writing this map into it would have re-staled the terrain and demanded a
# Blender bake for a constant that cannot move a vertex — the exact fault this
# module was written to end, arriving one more time from one more direction. The
# building side does not have the problem because a params module's bytes are
# already out of the hash. This file's bytes are out for the same reason (it
# computes the hash), and "what determines the ground" is its subject.
#
# What co-location bought is bought instead by a check:
# `test_declared_terrain_reads_are_real_reads` scans `terrain_gen.py` for a
# subscript or `.get()` of every key named here, so a declaration that stops
# being true fails rather than quietly excusing an omission.
#
# Keys that are the claim's machinery rather than a figure — `id`, `zone`,
# `label`, `confidence`, `sources`, notes — never reach the gate: they are
# stripped by `compile_scene.ground_fields`, the same enumeration the Evidence
# panel renders from. The gate therefore asks about exactly what a visitor is
# shown, and nothing else.
