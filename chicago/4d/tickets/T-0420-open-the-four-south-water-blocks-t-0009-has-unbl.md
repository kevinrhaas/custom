Open the four South Water blocks T-0009 has unblocked: 20 roofs of headroom on franklin, lasalle, clark and dearborn.

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — the definition of done, never weakened to pass)

**T-0365's option 1, now that T-0009 has answered it.** T-0365 measured that the anonymous-block
programme had no unblocked ground left: every platted block still carrying headroom was gated on
T-0009 or on T-0183. T-0009 closed on 2026-08-29 under the owner's ruling, and the load-bearing
half of that ruling for this ticket is one sentence — **the drawn South Water line does not move.**

T-0143 and T-0188 each refused to tighten a party-line row *against a line that may move*, and
T-0317 inherited the refusal. It is discharged: the corridor was re-derived from the control and
`data/streets/1835.json` was not touched.

| block | headroom | free lots |
|---|---|---|
| `blk_south_water_lasalle` | 8 | 3 |
| `blk_south_water_franklin` | 4 | 2 |
| `blk_south_water_clark` | 4 | 2 |
| `blk_south_water_dearborn` | 4 | 2 |

**20 roofs between them**, and it is the largest visible win the programme has. `blk_south_water_market`
is NOT in this ticket: it stays gated on T-0183, which is a control point the node rule cannot make.

**Take ONE block per run** — T-0028's programme rule is one run, one demonstration, one successor,
and four blocks is four runs. **Needs the bake** for the roofs it deals.

**Acceptance:** one block opened per run against its committed lots; the row stands on the block
face rather than on a re-derived line; the census in `tools/reconcile_665.py` reconciles; a
screenshot from the same spot shows roofs that were not there.
