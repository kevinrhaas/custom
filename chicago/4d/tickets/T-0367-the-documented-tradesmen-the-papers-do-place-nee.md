blocked_on: The ask is built and merged: tools/fronting_street.py derives which committed street a roof fronts from its facade bearing and footprint, and the deal now offers a placed man only the roofs of his trade on the street his own printings name, refusing him with which street was wanted and what stands there instead. Put to the 26 placed candidates it seats NONE: 8 are printed at a place that is not a street, 3 were being refused for a non-placement reason the old refusal hid, and the remaining 15 are on South Water, Dearborn or Lake, where this reconstruction stood no invented roof of their trades at all (the invented bakery, bootmaker, tailor and butcher are all on Lake). YOUR CALL: may a roof of an advertised trade be MOVED or ADDED onto South Water or Dearborn so these men can be seated, or does the seating simply wait until T-0263/T-0306 stand the documented storefronts there? See tools/replace_invented_residents.py --report and docs/LIBERTIES.md L205.

Piece 2 of 3 of **T-0264 — Documented people replace the invented**, split because the
parent needed more than one run's demonstration to be done.

**T-0366 refused 26 documented tradesmen for one reason: the papers say where they
were.** J. K. Botsford advertised at the corner of Dearborn and Lake; D. Graves baked
on South Water Street; L. W. Montgomery made boots on South Water; John T. Temple is on
Lake Street and South Water both. Every one of them practises a trade this town invented
a household for, and every one of them was refused, because the reconstructed roof the
deal would have reached for stands wherever the occupation census put it — which is
almost never the street the man advertised from. Moving him there would contradict the
advertisement that names him.

`tools/replace_invented_residents.py --report` prints the 26 with their places. What it
cannot do is ASK where a reconstructed roof stands: a household's dwelling is a
structure id, and its street lives in a placement note in prose, not in a field.

**Acceptance:** (one demonstration, never weakened to pass)

- A reconstructed dwelling can be asked which street it fronts, derived from the
  committed geometry rather than read out of a note.
- A placed documented tradesman takes a reconstructed roof ONLY on the street his own
  record names; where no roof of his trade stands on that street he stays refused, and
  the refusal says which street was wanted and what stood there instead.
- Before → after on the invented-person count, and every new card carries its citation.
- The refusals T-0366 printed shrink by exactly the number this ticket seats, and the
  report says so.

Related: **T-0263** and **T-0306** place the BUSINESSES on those same streets; a man
whose shop those tickets stand somewhere must not be given a dwelling that fights it.
