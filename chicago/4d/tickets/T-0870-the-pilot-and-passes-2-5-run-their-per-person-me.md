The pilot and passes 2-5 run their per-person membership assertions on the `--gate` path,
so a member whose `letter_list_only` flag moves in the tree kills the build instead of
being reported.

**Verified on `dev` at be0ee9d30, not inherited as a claim.**
`select_resident_research_pilot.main()` calls `derive()` before it looks at `--gate`, and
`derive()` raises `SystemExit` on each frozen member:

    for hid in LETTER_IDS:
        ...
        if not person.get("letter_list_only"):
            raise SystemExit(f"{hid}: no longer marked letter_list_only")

`select_resident_research_pass_2.py` has the same shape at its `member()` call
(`"{person_id}: no longer marked letter_list_only"` and the `established_profile`
counterpart), and passes 3-5 share that module's structure.

**Why this is the wrong direction of failure.** T-0764 has just settled that a snapshot
cell moving is *the research landing* and not staleness — `resident_cohort_freeze.gate`
now counts moved cells and reports them without failing. But a member's
`letter_list_only` flag moving is the same kind of event, arriving through a different
door, and it still stops the build. A cohort is a **frozen reservation of people**; what
the tree later says about those people is the finding the cohort exists to produce. The
gate should report it.

**Cohorts 13-15 already do the right thing, and theirs is the implementation to copy.**
`select_resident_research_pass_13.derive(pass_no, minting=False)` takes the flag precisely
so the assertions run when a cohort is being MINTED and not when it is being read
(T-0492, whose own comment records that running it on every call including `--gate` is
what broke the three cohorts before).

**Acceptance:**

1. The pilot and passes 2-5 scope their per-person membership assertions to the minting
   path, matching pass 13's `minting` parameter — the assertions are **moved, not
   deleted**, and a mint still refuses a member the stratum no longer describes.
2. On the `--gate` path a member whose flag has moved is **counted and named in the
   output**, in the same voice as `resident_cohort_freeze`'s moved-cell line, and the gate
   stays green.
3. A self-test case per selector proves both directions: minting refuses, gating reports.
4. `tools/check.sh` stays green with no manifest regenerated — this changes no cohort data.

**Found by:** PR #951, an independent implementation of T-0764 that #952 beat to the
merge. It named this residual and deliberately did not fold it in, because it meant
touching five selectors' selection logic in a PR about the snapshot. That reasoning holds;
the finding is kept here rather than lost with the branch. That PR filed it against
T-0854, which is a different ticket on `dev` — this is the re-filing at a free number.

## As built

The scope line drawn, because acceptance 1 says "per-person membership assertions" and
two of the five selectors ask that question as a TOTAL instead:

* **Hard on every path** — the member is still in the resident layer; is not
  `reconstructed`; is not an `inf_*` hypothesis or an unnamed placeholder (pass 5); and
  the frozen id lists are 75 unique, non-overlapping, and the size their collision lock
  declares. None of these can move under the tree without a person leaving it or the
  selector's own literals being edited. This is the staleness the freeze contract's
  assertion 2 describes, and T-0492's comment says pass 13 keeps it on the gate too.
* **Refused while minting, reported on the gate** — whether a member still matches the
  stratum it was DRAWN from: the `letter_list_only` flag, the established/richer-unplaced
  shape, and the `present_on_scene_date` value a letter-list stratum is named for.
  Passes 4 and 5 assert that per person; the pilot and passes 2 and 3 assert it as a
  stratum COUNT read off today's presence values, which is the same event asked as a
  total — so those counts are scoped with it. Passes 4 and 5 count their FROZEN stratum
  labels instead, so their totals cannot move and stay hard; a comment says so at each.

`resident_cohort_freeze.Membership` carries the scope and the report, and
`freeze.stratum_self_test()` runs a selector's probes through all four corners —
minting/frozen against moved/unmoved — which is acceptance 3.

Demonstrated end to end against the tree rather than only in the self-tests: with
`hh_force_john`'s `letter_list_only` flag flipped in `data/residents/households/`, dev's
pilot selector exits 1 on `--gate` with `hh_force_john: no longer marked
letter_list_only`; this branch's reports the same sentence under a "moved out of the
stratum they were drawn from since the freeze" line and exits 0. With the pilot manifest
moved aside so the run is a MINT, this branch's selector exits 1 on the same tree.

`tools/check.sh`: 381 steps, none red, no manifest regenerated (acceptance 4).
