title: Seat every attested and inferred household and business on the ground its evidence allows: a structure where one is named, a lot on the right face where an address, corner or later directory narrows it, a division band where only that is known — plural, dated, no fabricated coordinates

1,243 of 1,263 households have no `lives_at`; 1,213 no `works_at`; 1,191 are `unplaced`. T-1147
spends every LOCATION FACT the research holds and preserves the 123 business location limits;
this ticket takes the households and firms T-1147 leaves placed-to-a-street or unplaced and seats
them AS FAR AS THE EVIDENCE GOES plus one honest reconstructed step, through the placement policy
— never past it. It writes the **address book**: `data/reconstruction/1835_address_book.json`,
one row per household and per business, built by `tools/seat_known_1835.py --build|--check`.

**The seating ladder** (the first rung that fires; the row names it):

1. `structure` — a named roof (the 20 + the T-1147 spend): unchanged, tier as spent.
2. `lot` — an address, a corner ordinal, a lot-and-block line, a back-projected face (L218/L223)
   that narrows to a lot or two: the lot id(s) on the extended lot grid (T-1194),
   tier `inferred`, the policy from `docs/LOT-ADDRESS.md`/`CORNER-ORDINAL.md`/`ADDRESS-BACK-PROJECTION.md`.
3. `face` — a street only (the 61 street-only firms; a directory street): the block face(s)
   the policy prefers for that trade/household on that street, tier `inferred` for the street,
   `reconstructed` for the face choice, seeded.
4. `division_band` — a division from the evidence (a north-side baptism, a Wolf Point tavern
   keeper's household): the policy's band for that household class in that division, tier
   `reconstructed`.
5. `policy_only` — nothing in the evidence: the policy's band by trade/wealth class alone,
   tier `reconstructed`, and the row says so in words ("no source places this household; seated
   by the policy's rule <id>").
6. `unplaceable` — the evidence CONTRADICTS every band (T-0305's four American addresses, T-0251,
   T-0386 until ruled): stays unplaced with the ticket that owns it.

A household follows its head's workplace where the policy says trades lived at their shop
(store-residences, shop-houses, the keeper of an inn), and the row records which.

**Acceptance:**

- Every attested/inferred household and business has an address-book row at some rung; counts
  per rung printed; rungs 1–2 never move on a rung 3–5 rule; the 62 unplaceable firms remain
  unplaceable unless a rung ≤ 3 fact is cited.
- `division` on every household re-derived from the row (no household reads `unplaced` that
  has a rung ≤ 5 seat); the People view's division filter fills.
- `--check` in `check.sh`; the row's `replaceable_by` = a stronger rung.
- **Visible:** the household card's "Lived at / Worked at" show the seat and its rung in words;
  "Go to" takes the visitor to the face or lot; nothing is drawn — the roofs come in the build
  tickets.

**Stop condition:** every known person has a place on the map at the honest rung, and the build
tickets know which lot to raise a roof on for whom.

**THE FORT'S OFFICERS ARE ALREADY RULED ON (T-1348, 2026-09-19).** This sweep does not have
to re-adjudicate them. `docs/RESEARCH/fort_dearborn_garrison_1835.md` tests every card in the
layer that carries a rank or a military role against three clauses and returns one seat and
eleven refusals: **`allen_lieut_james` seats at `fort_dearborn_officers_quarters`, division
`fort`, `inferred`**, on the same argument `hh_maxwell_philip` already carries — a commissioned
officer of the United States Army, printed at Chicago on both sides of the scene date, lodged
in the building this dataset holds for the post's subordinate officers. The other eleven
(`baxley_j_m`, `jamison_l_t`, `green_j`, `smith_e_kirby`, `thompson_lieut_j_l`, `wilcox_d`,
`carpenter_nathaniel`, `morin_william_w`, `kirne_e`, `beaubien_jean_baptiste`,
`jackson_samuel`) do **not** go to the fort, each for a clause the memo states. T-1348 could
not write the seat itself: `hh_allen_lieut_james` is mint output and the mints derive
`division` and `lives_at`, so the seat is this sweep's to deal — which is what
`mint_civic_residents.py` says in its own refusal, *"the placement sweep does that, once the
resident list is complete"*.
