genealogytrails.com Cook County: inventory every section of the site, grade what it holds for 1835 Chicago, and split the extraction of residents, households, businesses, structures and occupations into tickets.

**The owner's ask, verbatim (2026-09-03):** "And this entire site has useful information so include a ticket to
assess and add information from here too https://genealogytrails.com/ill/cook/index.htm".

**What the site is.** Genealogy Trails' Cook County, Illinois pages: volunteer transcriptions of county records
and printed histories, section by section — the kind of site that holds early settlers' lists, biographies,
marriages from 1831, births and deaths, cemetery readings, census indexes, church records, Black Hawk War rolls,
newspaper extracts, tax and land lists, wills. Which of those it actually holds for Cook County, and how much of
each is 1830s, is exactly what this ticket finds out: the session that filed it could not fetch the site (its
proxy answers an empty page), so the inventory is yours to make from the index page down.

**Phase 1 — ASSESS (this ticket).** Walk the index and every section it links. For each section write one row
in `data/research/genealogytrails/inventory.json`: URL, what it transcribes, the ORIGINAL it derives from (the
site usually names it — a county history, a newspaper, a record book), the era it covers, a count of 1830s
items, and a grade for 1835 Chicago (a transcription is a pointer to its original: cite the original where it is
named, the page where it is not). A README says what the site is good for and what it is not. Cache every page
you read under `text/`.

**Phase 2 — EXTRACT, as split tickets.** Every section worth reading becomes a piece via
`node tools/ticket.mjs split T-0556 "…" "…"` so the pieces keep this place in the queue — residents and
households from the settlers' lists and biographies, businesses and occupations from the same, structures and
streets from the histories, marriages and deaths as dating evidence for people already attested. Each piece
carries the T-0492 shape, source records for the originals, `describes_date` on everything, and the ladder for
any grade.

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — one demonstration, never weakened to pass)
- `inventory.json` covers every section the index links, none skipped silently; the README states the grades.
- The split filed with one piece per section worth reading, each with a stated acceptance; the pieces hold this
  ticket's place in the queue.
- Anything read in passing that is a town finding is in `claims.json` with quote and locator, now, not later.

**Links:** T-0492 (shape) · T-0513 (consolidation — waits on this and its pieces) · the repo's existing
Genealogy Trails-genre sources in `data/sources/` (Kane, Racine and Will county old-settler pieces) for the
citation shape.

**This is overall expansion, not a residents-only pass.** The owner's words, 2026-09-03: "this is overall
expansion because while you are parsing for residents and household people you might as well improve the
business and structure and occupation and other surrounding data and attributes that will help us render the
most complete reconstruction possible of chicago 1835." So every person this source yields is read WITH the
trade, the business, the street or lot, the building and the year it carries — and each of those goes to the
layer it belongs to (residents, households, `businesses`, structures, `claims.json` town findings with
`town_finding: true`, verbatim quote and locator), under the research-domain shape T-0492 fixed. Later
evidence stays date-flagged (`describes_date`), and under the ratified ladder (quoted in T-0513) a later
source alone never makes an 1835 resident — it corroborates, enriches and dates. No IPUMS serial is minted
here; nothing here regrades a person without the ladder's test being stated on the record.
