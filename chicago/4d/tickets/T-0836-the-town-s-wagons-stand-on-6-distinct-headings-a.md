The town's wagons stand on 6 distinct headings and the smoke asks for 8, so dev is red at both viewports on a layer no branch has touched.

Found by T-0431, which ran the smoke over its own diff and got the same single red at both
viewports.

**The reading.** `smoke_renderer.mjs` part 4, *"the town's wagons vary in type and in the way
they stand"*, requires `bearings.size >= 8` — distinct headings bucketed to the nearest 5°.
The town has **6**: buckets `[0, 18, 35, 36, 54, 72]`, i.e. 0°, ~90°, ~175°, ~180°, ~270°,
~360°. Kinds and share pass (23 farm_box, 23 covered, 18 cart of 64 town wagons); it is the
headings alone that fail.

**It is not any branch's doing.** `data/yard/town_trade_goods.json` is byte-identical between
`origin/dev` and T-0431's branch, and `townWagons` is `wagons.filter(w => w.stands_on ||
w.in_enclosure)` — so the assertion is a pure function of a file no recent branch has
touched. Reproduced from the committed data directly, without a browser:

    town wagons 64; farm_box 23, covered 23, cart 18; bearing buckets 6

**Why six.** `generate_yard_goods.py` stands a wagon square to the frontage it serves, and
the town's streets run on two bearings — so every wagon lands on one of four cardinal
headings plus the two the off-grid frontages give. The assertion asks for eight, which the
rule as written cannot produce however many wagons are dealt.

So one of the two is wrong: either the rule should draw wagons up at angles to the kerb (they
were not all squared in 1835 — a wagon backed to a door stands askew), or the assertion's
eight is a number nobody can meet and should be restated against what the rule can produce.
Not this ticket's call to make quietly: it is a claim about how the town looked.

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — the definition of done, never weakened to pass)

- Either the wagon rule produces headings the assertion can pass and the reason is a claim
  about 1835 (with its LIBERTIES entry), or the assertion is restated against the rule with
  the measured ceiling written into it. Never both, and never the assertion weakened alone to
  make the red go away.
- Both viewports go green on part 4 and the reading is filed in `tools/dev-smoke-state.json`.
