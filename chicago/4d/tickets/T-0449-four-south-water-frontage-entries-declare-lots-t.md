Four South Water frontage entries declare lots their runs never reach, and each hides its block's headroom.

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — the definition of done, never weakened to pass)

Measured on 2026-08-30 by T-0429, which hit this on `blk_south_water_lasalle` and had to correct
that block's own entry before it could be dealt. The same defect stands on four more entries, and
all four are the blocks T-0430, T-0431 and T-0432 are queued to open.

A `frontage` entry in `data/reconstruction/1835_platted_block_parcels.json` names the LOTS its
party-line run stands across. Two files then read that list for two different purposes and they
disagree:

* `tools/plat_occupancy.py` derives occupancy from FOOTPRINTS, so the 665-roof schedule scores a
  lot free when nothing physically stands on it. That is why `blk_south_water_lasalle` has been
  reading three free lots and eight roofs of headroom.
* `check_block` in `tools/generate_block_infill.py` reads the RECIPE, so a lot named on any deal's
  frontage falls in the class `built on by another deal on this block` and its four lot classes
  must be disjoint. A second deal that tries to build on such a lot is refused.

So an over-declared lot is headroom the schedule offers and the generator will not let anybody
spend. Measured, declared against reached:

| entry | declared | actually reached |
|---|---|---|
| `phase3_platted_block_south_water_franklin` | 2, 4, 6 | **6** |
| `phase3_platted_block_south_water_wells` | 0, 2, 4 | **2, 4** |
| `phase3_platted_block_south_water_clark` | 2, 4 | **4** |
| `phase3_platted_block_south_water_dearborn` | 0, 2, 4 | **4** |

Every one of them is a run anchored `corner: east` whose units ran out before they crossed back
into the lots the entry had listed — the same shape T-0429 corrected on `lasalle` (declared 0, 2,
4; stands on 4 alone).

**The correction is free, and T-0429 demonstrated that it is.** The strip's `along_max` is the east
line of the eastmost declared lot, and on an east-anchored run that lot is the one the run actually
occupies, so dropping the unreached lots does not move the anchor. `frontage.lots` is not part of
the record payload either — only `frontage.why` is — so no structure file changes, no mesh stales
and no bake is needed. What has to be checked per entry is the run's own ceiling: `check_block`
allows `ROW_UNITS_PER_LOT` (3) units per declared lot, so an entry that drops to one lot must be
carrying no more than three units. `lasalle` carried exactly three.

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — one demonstration, never weakened to pass)

- The four entries above declare only the lots their runs measurably stand across, re-measured by
  the same reading T-0429 used (project each unit's footprint onto the block face, project each
  declared lot onto it, and keep a lot the run's span overlaps).
- `tools/generate_block_infill.py --check` re-derives every committed record byte for byte, so the
  correction is provably one to what the recipe DECLARED and not to anything it built.
- `tools/reconcile_665.py --check` still re-derives, and the PR states, per block, the headroom the
  correction hands back.
- Each entry's `arrangement_note` and `frontage.runs` record the correction with its measurement,
  as `lasalle`'s do. Nothing else in the entry moves — not `drawn_from_schedule`, not `families`,
  not a slot.
- Sized S: it is four one-line edits and their prose, no bake, and the gate is `check.sh`.

**Note it does NOT itself build anything** — it is the invisible half that unblocks T-0430, T-0431
and T-0432, and it should be named as such under the visible-progress rule's third exemption. If a
run opening one of those blocks finds its own entry over-declared, correcting that ONE entry in
passing is that ticket's business and this one shrinks accordingly.
