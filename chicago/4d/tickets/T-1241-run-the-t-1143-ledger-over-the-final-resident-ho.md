Run the T-1143 ledger over the final resident, household, business and structure layers and publish the closing research audit at zero unclassified units.

Piece 5 of 5 of **T-1147 — Spend every defensible home, workplace and business-location finding, preserve the 123 location limits, and close research with zero unclassified attested or inferred fact**, split because the parent needed more than one run's demonstration to be done. The parent keeps the full ask and its links; this ticket owns one slice of it.

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — one demonstration, never weakened to pass)


## IT WAS FOLDED INTO T-1157 AND THE GATE REFUSED IT (2026-09-17)

The owner asked for the research spend to be tightened, and three tickets standing at the
end of the band — T-1144, T-1241 and T-1157 — looked like one act. T-1144 folded cleanly.
**This one did not, and the reason is worth keeping.**

`research_spend_ledger.py` holds a strict invariant: *a unit may only defer to work that is
still going to happen.* **748 unresolved units** across the book, directory and letter-list
claims defer to T-1147, and a `split` parent only counts as live while at least one of its
children is open. T-1237, T-1238 and T-1239 are done; folding away T-1240 and this ticket
left none open, T-1147 stopped reading `split_live`, and all 748 units were suddenly
deferred to finished work. `measure_research_spend.py --check` failed on every one.

So this stays open, and consolidating it is not a matter of a tidier queue — it would need
those 748 units repointed at whatever absorbs it, which is a bigger and riskier change than
the saving.

**What DOES carry over is the tightening.** Run this in the SAME PASS as T-1157: the ledger
over the final layers is that report's evidence section, not a separate expedition. One run
produces both, and the closing figures are published with the sign-off rather than ahead of
it. T-1240 stays folded into T-1255 — one open child is all the invariant needs, and this is
it.
