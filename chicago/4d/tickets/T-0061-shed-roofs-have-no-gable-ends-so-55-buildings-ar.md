**The owner's report, 2026-08-18, with a screenshot** (standing on Lake Street, SE 126°,
inspecting *Reconstructed D2 rough plank dwelling or shanty #04*): "there are some buildings
with partial roofs like it is supposed to be a slanted roof but it is not rendered correctly."
The frame shows a pale triangular gap where the side wall should close under the slope — you
see through the building to the sky.

**DIAGNOSED, not guessed.** `generators/inferred_placeholder.py` → `record_geometry()`:

```python
if roof_type == "shed":
    rise = min(wall_h * .72, math.tan(pitch) * d)
    quad(groups["roof"], ...)          # the single slope — and that is ALL
else:                                   # gable
    quad(groups["roof"], ...)          # two slopes
    quad(groups["roof"], ...)
    tri(groups["wall"], (0,wall_h,0), (0,ridge,-d/2), (0,wall_h,-d))   # end fill
    tri(groups["wall"], (w,wall_h,-d), (w,ridge,-d/2), (w,wall_h,0))   # end fill
```

**The gable branch fills its end walls with two `tri()` calls; the shed branch has none.**
A shed roof rises from the front wall to the back, which leaves a RIGHT TRIANGLE open on
each side wall, and `box()` only draws walls to `wall_h`. Nothing closes the gap, so the
interior and the sky show through.

**Scale: 55 records carry `roof_type: shed`** (against 254 gable, 5 other), so this is every
shed-roofed placeholder in the town, not a stray.

**The repair** is two `tri()` calls in the shed branch, mirroring the gable ones but sloping
front-to-back instead of to a centre ridge: for each side wall x ∈ {0, w}, the triangle
(x, wall_h, 0) · (x, wall_h+rise, −d) · (x, wall_h, −d). Watch the winding order — the gable
pair is wound opposite on the two ends so both faces point outward; get it wrong and the fill
is invisible from outside, which looks identical to the bug.

**No Blender needed** — this generator writes glTF directly (0 references to `bpy`), so the
improve runner can close it. `tools/check.sh` already asserts "inferred placeholder GLBs match
their records", so regenerate in the same commit or that gate will catch the drift.

**Acceptance:** no shed-roofed placeholder shows a gap from any angle — demonstrated with a
before/after pair from the owner's pose (Lake Street, SE 126°, the D2 shanty) — and a gate
that would have caught it: for every placeholder, the wall+roof surface encloses its volume,
or more simply, the shed branch emits the same face count per side as the gable branch. The
55 regenerated GLBs pass check.sh's existing placeholder assertion.
