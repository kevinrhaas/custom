`tools/smoke_renderer.mjs` § `the panel states that once too — and counts nothing by
hand` guards against a hand-typed count of the open questions creeping back into the
Evidence panel. It does that with `!/Three of these/i.test(open.heading)`, and
`open.heading` is the textContent of the WHOLE panel — which includes every rendered
liberty. K53 (#221) shipped a liberty whose reasoning opens *"Why invent it rather than
leave the wand. Three of these records describe multi-stemmed plants in their own
committed text"*, so the guard now fires on a sentence about shrubs.

**Measured 2026-08-17**, `origin/dev` at `3114e061`, mobile 390×780 on the published
mirror: the assertion FAILS, `occurrences: 1` (the half it actually checks is correct)
and `hasHandCount: true` (the liberty). The desktop half has never fitted this runner's
per-command ceiling, which is why a gate red since #221 was only seen today.

The guard is not wrong to exist — it is aimed at the wrong element. The paraphrase it
bans lived in the open-questions heading, and `#uncertain-note` / the heading node is
what it should scan; the same fault is one line up in the `the panel states it once —
the hand-written paraphrase is gone` sibling, which divides over the whole panel too and
survives only because nothing has yet written its recorded note twice.

**Acceptance:** the assertion scans the element that carries the claim rather than the
whole panel; a liberty may contain any phrase without failing a gate about the open
questions; and the guard still fires when a hand-typed count IS put back in the heading
(prove it, the way this suite proves its other assertions fire when broken).

Found by T-0001's run (PR #231), which measured the same failure on `origin/dev` before merging.
