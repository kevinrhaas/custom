title: Export the borderline roster: every name the research read and withheld from 1835 — single-source, refused, surname-only, uncertain presence, letter-list-only — with its source, reason and re-admission class, so reconstruction can name real people before it invents any

The owner, 2026-09-17: *"You may use research that was borderline in naming and give them a real
human name … like there was research that you had that may have only been one source not a few
so you marked them out, but now is the time to dip back into that and fill out the population."*

The research spend was, correctly, conservative: the T-1143 ledger holds 7,329 `refused`,
11,880 `later_only`, 63 `outside_chicago` and 32 `aggregate_only` units, and the resident layer
carries 893 households `uncertain` on 1 July 1835 and 736 `letter_list_only`. Those refusals are
NOT overturned here — a refusal was a ruling about EVIDENCE, and it stands. What changes is that
a name the corpus printed is a better reconstructed resident than a name drawn from a pool, so
the reconstruction band must be offered the corpus's own names first, with each one's evidence
limit stated. This ticket builds that offer as a generated roster; it mints nobody.

**The roster** — `data/reconstruction/1835_borderline_roster.json`, built by
`tools/export_borderline_roster.py --build|--check`, one row per candidate, fields: `name_as_read`,
`normalised`, `source_id`, `claim_or_record_id`, `describes_date`, `domain`, `ledger_disposition`,
`ledger_reason`, `existing_household_id` (if a card exists), `presence_today`, and the
**re-admission class**:

| class | who | what reconstruction may do |
|---|---|---|
| `R1_in_window_uncertain` | a card exists, in-window source, presence `uncertain` (the 893) | fix presence `present` at tier `reconstructed`, basis = the dated appearance + the model's persistence rate |
| `R2_in_window_single_source` | one 1833–35 appearance, no card, ledger `refused: single source` / `insufficient_identity` | mint a reconstructed resident under the read name |
| `R3_1834_return_or_muster` | the 1 April 1834 return (T-1153) / 1832 muster names with no 1835 corroboration | mint reconstructed, presence bounded by the persistence rate |
| `R4_surname_only_census` | 1830 census surname-only refusals (25) and 1840 heads whose surname matches an 1835 household | may supply a FAMILY (spouse/child bands) to an existing head at `reconstructed`, never a new head |
| `R5_later_only_backprojectable` | 1839 directory / 1840 census / Fergus 1843 names whose own biography or a second source puts arrival before 1835-07-01 | mint reconstructed with arrival at the biography's date; else NOT eligible |
| `R6_native_metis_black` | a Native, Métis or free Black person any source names in or near the town in window (the treaty schedules, the registers, the traders' lists, the 1833 freedom certificates) — whatever its ledger disposition | mint at the ladder's grade where the evidence allows, else `reconstructed`; always `review_required` for Native/Métis; `community` set; owned by T-1177 |
| `R0_ineligible` | outside Chicago, Bear Creek couples (T-1129), explicit `researched_not_resident`, post-scene arrivals | never |

Every row states which rule put it in its class and the ledger row it came from. The roster is
sized against the ledger: every `refused`/`unresolved`/`later_only` unit that names a person is
either in a class or listed under `not_a_person_unit` with the reason — no unit is silently
dropped.

**Acceptance:**

- The roster builds, re-derives byte-for-byte under `--check` in `check.sh`, and prints counts
  per class per domain; a `docs/RESEARCH/borderline-roster-2026-09.md` review page shows the
  counts and twenty worked examples (five per class R1–R4, with the reason each was withheld).
- No card, grade, presence or ledger row changes in this ticket.
- The 10 `researched_not_resident` names are R0 and the tool proves it with a self-test; every
  `review_required` / `touches_removal` household's named-but-uncarded kin are R6.
- The 1840 IPUMS household extract is used for R4 only as a SHAPE (age bands) attached to a
  head that 1835 evidence already carries — the T-0507 line stands: *1840 household members
  are never minted into 1835 solely from census counts.*

**Stop condition:** reconstruction can read one file to learn every real name the sources offer
below the inferred bar, and what each name licenses.

**Links:** T-1143 · T-1146 · T-1153 · T-1129 · T-0507 · T-1027 (the one-letter pairs stay its own
question — rows it owns are `unresolved:T-1027`, class R0 until it rules) ·
`docs/RESEARCH/resident-grading-policy.md`.
