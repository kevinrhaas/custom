`tools/mint_letter_list_residents.py` dates a minted household's `arrival` from the
issue the CLAIM sits in — "The first return holding a letter for this name is the
Democrat of 4 March 1834" on `hh_ll_thomas_conger`, written this run. T-0331 showed
that 4 March is the NINTH printing of the Chicago post office's **1 January 1834**
return; the same list was printed in every Democrat from Vol. I No. 7 of 1834-01-07.
So the bound is true but weak, and it is weak by an accident of which impression an
extraction pass happened to reach.

The `not_later_than` precision means nothing here is false, which is why this is filed
rather than fixed inside T-0331: the fix is a change to how a household is derived, and
it moves every letter-list household this project holds, not two.

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — one demonstration, never weakened to pass)

- A letter-list household's arrival bound is dated by the RETURN — the date the list
  itself states, `January 1, 1834` — or, where the return date is unreadable, by the
  EARLIEST printing that carries the name, and the note says which of the two it used.
- The nine printings T-0331 counted are the worked case: every household minted off
  `chicago_democrat_1834_03_04` moves to the January bound, and the note names the
  printing run rather than the issue.
- `mint_letter_list_residents.py --check` re-derives green, and its self-tests assert
  that two printings of one return give ONE bound.
