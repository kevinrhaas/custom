Hold the Kinzie-view plate as a source record.

Found by T-0052, which needed it and could not have it. The plate — the Kinzie mansion group,
plate "12", showing the piazza front, the row of Lombardy poplars and the picket-fenced garden
plots — is the ONLY picture this project has of a garden fence in Chicago, and it reaches the
repository as an owner-supplied reference image with a README and nothing else. There is no
`chicagology_*` source record for it, which is why `data/enclosures/town_dooryard_pickets.json`
carries an EMPTY `existence.sources` and cites a committed path instead. The README itself gives
the instruction: *"Anything used in a critique loop should be identified against chicagology's
plate numbering first and cited to the matching `chicagology_*` source record."*

Note it is tier 5 pictorial and retrospective, so it may drive massing, materials and setting as
`inferred` and may never drive a coordinate — the record has to say so, the way its siblings do.
Check `rights_status` before anything derives an asset from it.

**Acceptance:** a source record in `data/sources/` for the plate, resolving from
`data/enclosures/town_dooryard_pickets.json` and from `docs/ROADMAP.md` K5 (a), with its tier, its
rights status, what it attests and what it does not; and the enclosure record's `sources` filled in
where the citation is now a path.
