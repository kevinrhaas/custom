Twelve dooryard gardens went with the retired households: should a garden follow the house or the household?.

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — the definition of done, never weakened to pass)

**Filed by T-0516, which caused it and refused to decide it.**

`tools/generate_dooryard_pickets.py` admits a lot to the garden layer on four clauses, and
clause 4 is *"a household recorded as living in it"* — read off the structure record's
`occupants` prose naming an `hh_` id. T-0516 withdrew that prose from the 104 anonymous
roofs the retired inferred-household layer had adopted, because the households it named
were removed on 2026-09-02 under the owner's ruling. The rule then did exactly what it
says: **thirteen dooryard gardens became one.** The survivor is Elijah Harmon's, the only
lot this record reaches where the committed household index carries a real `lives_at`.

The generator's own comment anticipated this and named the ticket: *"the stale-prose
problem is T-0516's"*. So the collapse is the rule working, not the rule breaking — twelve
gardens were resting on the prose of households that no longer exist, and a garden behind a
house nobody lives in claims a gardener who does not exist.

**But the question underneath it is the owner's, not the loop's.** A dooryard garden could
just as defensibly follow the HOUSE — one dwelling alone on a platted lot, by archetype and
by function — as follow a recorded household. That reading would keep all thirteen and
would say something weaker but still true: houses of this kind had kitchen gardens behind
them. It is a claim about what the town looked like, and the owner has ruled on exactly
this kind of trade before ("lots of nothing happened in the city which is bad").

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — the definition of done, never weakened to pass)

- The owner is asked, in these terms, which rule the garden layer runs on: the household
  (today, thirteen → one) or the house (thirteen or more, on a weaker claim). Use
  `ticket.mjs block --owner --on "..."` rather than choosing for him.
- Whichever he rules, clause 4 is rewritten to say it, `docs/LIBERTIES.md` L129's entry is
  brought into line with the rule actually in force, and the count before and after is
  stated.
- If the house rule wins, the same question is asked of the lot-line fences, which run off
  the same occupancy test.
