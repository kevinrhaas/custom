Replace the one-occupation resident field with dated plural roles and migrate every matched trade, profession and civic office without back-projecting later evidence.

**Measured by the owner-requested audit, 2026-09-15.** The newspaper gazetteer already stores
`persons[].occupations[]`, directory crosswalks carry later occupations, and the 1839 register
carries civic offices, but a resident exposes one `occupation` block and the people index reads
only that value. The audit found 1,126 structured role-evidence rows tied to current residents and
176 people with more than one distinct raw/later role string. Synonyms may describe one trade;
dates and source claim ids, not string count, decide the assertions.

Daniel Elston is the acceptance fixture. Research calls him candle manufacturer, soap
manufacturer, chandler, pork curer, provision dealer and soap boiler in 1833-34; brickmaker in
1839; school inspector in the 1839 civic register; and press-brick maker in 1843-44. The model
shows only `soap_and_candle_maker`, incorrectly graded as an attested 1835 occupation.

**Acceptance:**

1. Add a plural, dated resident role schema. Each assertion carries a controlled role, the source's
   wording, role kind (`trade`, `profession`, `office`, `employment` or `business_interest`),
   `from`/`to` or point date with precision, confidence, source id and claim/entry id. Unknown
   dates stay unknown; they are never widened to the scene date.
2. Make `roles[]` canonical. Keep a singular scene occupation only as a generated compatibility
   view of roles that actually cover 1 July 1835; two simultaneous roles remain two roles.
3. Migrate every matched role from the newspaper gazetteer, resident later-occupation blocks,
   1839 directory and civic-register crosswalks, and the 1843/1844 identity-master appearances.
   Produce a reconciliation table: offered, asserted, synonym-folded, refused and unresolved.
4. Resolve T-0991 by retaining its six 1833 trades as dated pre-scene roles and removing their
   claim to be attested 1835 occupations unless an in-window source is found. Jones and Kimball's
   later, different trades remain separate assertions rather than overwriting the earlier ones.
5. The people view shows all roles as a dated timeline, clearly marks which (if any) reach the scene
   date, and searches both controlled and printed wording. Daniel Elston visibly shows his
   manufacturing, provisions/packing, brickmaking and school-inspector evidence with dates.
6. Extend the schema, validators, compiler, resident audit and layer-read census. Gates fail when a
   role loses its source/claim id, an undated/later role enters the 1835 compatibility field, or a
   structured role is retained in research but absent from the migration disposition table.

**Stop condition:** every matched trade/profession/office row has a dated role, a documented fold,
or a refusal; the singular field is no longer capable of erasing a second role.
