# QUEUE — top is next. The parser reads only T-NNNN lines; ticket files hold evidence and acceptance.
# The owner sets the order. Work top-down, skipping a blocked or already-claimed ticket.
# Add findings to an existing ticket first. Put new one-run work beside its dependency;
# add new research readings to RESEARCH COMPLETION so the spend band can drain.
# Split multi-run epics into bounded tickets when reached; do not create a refill at the top.
# Research spend: fix identity/date/mint gates before deriving cards. THE LETTER-LIST
# RULING IS MADE (owner, 2026-09-18: option (c) on T-0660) — refusals 7 and 8 are
# mint-time rules and do not un-mint a standing record; nothing is retired, rank() is
# unchanged, and the pass SAYS a collision instead of acting on it. T-1144 is no longer
# waiting on anything and is the queue's second row; the line that told runs to skip it
# is gone with this. T-0691 shrinks to wiring its --check into check.sh.
# South Through Time: 1812 depiction follows AGENTS.md Indigenous-history review;
# ship no human figures. T-0469/T-0470/T-0471 depend on T-0468; T-0472 on T-0470.
# Prairie Avenue: T-0474 follows T-0473; T-0475/T-0477 follow T-0474;
# T-0476 follows T-0475. Respect needs_bake and other ticket-level blockers.
# Completion: preserve explicit refusals and later/out-of-town evidence; zero
# unclassified research does not mean forcing uncertain people or locations into 1835.
# T-1027 is the one-letter identity epic; Newberry and 1840 deposit work follow
# their lower resident yield. Read each ticket before splitting or claiming.
# Reconstruction (owner, 2026-09-17): BAND 2 IS OPEN NOW — it reads the layer and writes
# reports, models and an order book, and it needs no sign-off to do that. Bands 3-5 WRITE
# reconstructed people, businesses and roofs, and those wait for T-1157 to say GO.
#   The first cut gated 2-5 together, and it starved the top: band 1's rows were all in
#   flight or self-blocked, so runs fell past 59 gated tickets into SOUTH THROUGH TIME and
#   LOOP IMPROVEMENTS (T-0467, T-1154, 2026-09-17). A gate that empties the top of the
#   queue sends the loop to the bottom of it.
# Every reconstructed value carries tier, basis, seed and replaceable_by (T-1158); the order
# book (T-1166) is the quota; docs/RESEARCH/1835_reconstruction_plan.md is the map.
# Sub-bands (3A/3B/3C, 5A-5E) may be taken by different agents; within a sub-band, top first.
# Build tickets in 5C are needs_bake and hand on a successor. Native, Métis and Black residents,
# families and businesses ARE reconstructed (owner, 2026-09-17; T-1177), review_required, no figures.
# Owner, 2026-09-17: THE CITY COMES FIRST. Bands 6 (arrival and jaunts) and 7 (south
# through time) are PARKED BEHIND IT — jaunts first, then south through time. They were
# numbered 5F-5J, which read as part of the 5A-5E structures programme and is why they
# looked like city work; they are band 6 now so the ordering says what it means.
#   AND A RUN MAY NOT FALL INTO THEM. While any row in bands 1-5 is workable, that row is
# the work. If the top is gated or every row is in flight, the run SAYS SO and stops — it
# does not walk down to bands 6–9. That fall-through is how T-0467 and T-1154 were
# picked up out of the bottom of a 148-line queue on 2026-09-17 while the city waited.
# TICKET BUDGET (T-1295, owner 2026-09-17: "I don't want too many tickets and not making
# any progress"). `ticket.mjs new` REFUSES at 140 queue lines, and refuses a branch its
# fourth new ticket. Override is `--anyway --why "<reason>"` and the reason is written into
# the file. Filing is free and working is not — add a finding to the ticket it was found in
# first, which is what the line above already asks for. `split` is exempt: it replaces a
# ticket rather than adding one. An EPIC states its own cap in children (T-1236: three).
# --- 0. BLOCKING THE QUEUE (owner, 2026-09-20). These rows are first because the loop
# --- cannot judge its own work until they are done. THREE assertions have been standing
# --- red on dev for days, and because they are red, smoke_budget reports every leg that
# --- covers them as 'already red on dev' and runs skip it — so a real regression in those
# --- parts would look exactly like the reds already there. The gate is not measuring.
# --- Below them: the deadlock that needed hands on four PRs in one evening, and the two
# --- derivation faults that cost cycles on every branch that re-derives.
# --- The old note here described the terrain fossil on #1521/#1518, cleared 2026-09-19.
# --- FOUR was the count until 2026-09-21, and it is THREE because T-1369 closed, not
# --- because its leg went green: the fix landed on #1605 and is proved on dev by the
# --- stage's own 25 rules and by the layer on disk, but desktop part 3 can no longer be
# --- RUN inside the foreground ceiling — it is killed in the block before the assertion,
# --- which has therefore been unevaluated since 2026-09-18. That is T-1501, at the bottom.


# --- 1. RESEARCH SPEND — truth, safe derivation, roles, profiles, and locations
# --- 2. 1835 TOWN ANALYSIS — the known population profiled, the town modelled, the order book (OPEN NOW)
# --- 3A. RECONSTRUCT RESIDENTS — programme, then complete the known people (attributes, arrival, families, re-admissions)
T-1448 — Mint the staffing shortfall to the model's typical band: the 105 reconstructed hands 96 houses are still short, written as a stage of the resident reconstruction programme into cards of their own, each carrying its house, its role and where it slept, and nothing already committed written to
T-1299 — Admit the ten scene-reaching press roles into the 1835 occupation field by making the four generators that own it agree
# --- 3B. RECONSTRUCT RESIDENTS — fill the model: trades, women and children, lodgers, garrison, cohorts, transients
# --- 3C. RECONSTRUCT RESIDENTS — converge
# --- 4. BUSINESSES — the authored layer and view, the audit, staffing model, five reconstruction groups, staff, converge

# --- 5A. STRUCTURES — ground: north and west streets and alleys, terrain extent, the lot grid beyond the river

# --- 5B. STRUCTURES — seating: placement policy, roof programme re-derived, anonymous roofs redealt, everyone seated


T-1444 — Release generate_west_infill's 35 held slots onto the extended ground: the terrain gate retired, the placements instantiated and baked
T-1497 — The D5 deep-plan cottage has no archetype that can build its front gable: dwelling_frame / deep_plan_gable_front, and the 58 roofs standing on an eaves-front placeholder until it exists
T-1513 — Seat the policy-only rung: the 1,186 households no source places anywhere, banded by the policy's class rule and dealt a division from the town model — seeded, order-book-counted, and every card's division re-derived so the People view's division filter fills
T-1199 — Seat every reconstructed household, business, lodging house and camp by the placement policy into the extended lot grid: multiple buildings per main-street lot, single roofs on the back streets, labourers on the small lots and fringes, the noxious trades on the branches — deterministic, order-book-counted
# --- 5C. STRUCTURES — build, one district per run, baked, successor handed on (frame budget measured before every push)
T-1200 — Build the South Water Street river front to its seats: the forwarding houses, warehouses, stores and store-residences on the party lines from Market to State, the freight sheds and landings behind, every roof with its firm and its keeper
T-1201 — Build the Lake Street and Dearborn–Clark–LaSalle core to its seats: the store fronts and store-residences, the hotels' neighbours, the professional offices over shops, the mechanics' shops on State and Dearborn, the cottages behind them
T-1202 — Build the Randolph–Washington tier and the public square's neighbours to their seats: the professional and merchant houses (H1/H2), the churches and schools the civic band established, the log jail and the estray pen as they stand, the dwellings falling southward
T-1203 — Build the South Division's outer ground to its seats: the Fort Dearborn Addition and Michigan Street tract dwellings, the Clark–State cottages south of Washington where the ground allows, the packing and slaughter yards on the South Branch, the country places outside the plat
T-1204 — Build the fort reach and the lakefront to their seats: the sutler's, the garrison's outbuildings and the Agency establishment as the dossiers allow, the lighthouse keeper's, the pier-works yard at the river mouth, the Lake House's neighbours on the north bank east end
T-1205 — Build the North Division's Kinzie band to its seats: the Kinzie properties' neighbours, the North Water bank's forwarding and heavy trades, the Wolcott–Kinzie core's stores and taverns, the brickyard and the school, the dwellings between Kinzie and Michigan
T-1206 — Build Kinzie's Addition and the north tier to their seats: the labourers' and mechanics' cabins, shanties and small cottages on the addition's small lots, the scattered better houses on the Rush–Pine fringe, the open ground left honestly open
T-1207 — Build the West Division's Wolf Point and Canal Street approach to their seats: the taverns' yards and stables, the grocery and blacksmith on the approach, the ferry and the bridge heads, the cabins and boarding houses of the forks
T-1208 — Build the West Division's outer clusters and Wabansia to their seats: the three looser clusters toward the Des Plaines edge, the Wabansia cabins on the North Branch, the farms and barns on the prairie edge, the held 35 slots released on the extended ground
T-1209 — Build the boarding houses to their beds: the H1–H3 houses the lodging model sized, each with the window rhythm, service wing and stovepipes its capacity implies, its stable and privies, on the seats near the landings and approaches — and re-size the named hotels' outbuildings to their guests
# --- 5D. STRUCTURES — finish: fabric by household, plank walks, yards, signs, camps
T-1210 — Deal building fabric, finish and weathering by who lived and worked there: a physician's or forwarder's house painted and glazed, a tradesman's cottage weathered clapboard, a labourer's cabin unpainted and patched — the rule set on the material sheet, applied to every dwelling and business, no attested finish moved
T-1211 — Plank sidewalks, stoops, hitching posts and street crossings for every business face, varied by the business — a forwarding house's wide decked walk, a store's board walk and stoop, a smithy's bare ground and rail, a tavern's posts and mounting block — extended to the new fronts town-wide
T-1212 — Yards for every household: lot-line and dooryard fences, gardens, woodpiles, wells, privies and stables assigned by household type, wagons and barrels and trade goods at the shops by trade — the enclosure, yard and outbuilding layers extended to the reconstructed town
T-1213 — Signboards for every business that would have hung one: the reconstructed firms' names and trades in period lettering and forms, the attested signs untouched, the signless trades left signless by rule
T-1214 — Build the camps of the summer of 1835: a tent and wagon-camp archetype, the encampments on the grounds the transient ticket evidenced — the land-sale crowd south of the fort, the immigrants' wagons at the west approach, the pier gang at the river mouth — bounded, labelled, and empty of figures
# --- 5E. STRUCTURES — converge: every person housed, every business roofed, the town complete
T-1215 — Converge the reconstructed town: every person housed, every business roofed, every roof occupied or its use stated, the census's dwellings ratio met, the programme reconciled, the budgets re-measured and set — the completion report a visitor can open
# Arrival/jaunts: read docs/ARRIVAL-JAUNTS-EXECUTION.md; honor ticket dependencies.

T-1286 — Cross-check the derived 1812 pre-cut shore against the Harrison 1830 trace, and record what the two readings disagree about
T-1243 — Author the e1830_natural terrain spec and generate the 1812 heightfield and the ground and water meshes across the Fort-to-Eighteenth-Street corridor

# --- 8. UNREAL DELIVERY — repeatable native builds, web parity, then streaming
# Programme: T-1356; docs/unreal/README.md. Owner-ranked here on 2026-09-18.
# Remote-workable preparation (still subject to the city-first ordering above):
T-1357 — Publish a versioned Chicago scene bundle from every successful scheduled asset bake
T-0252 — Decide once whether a baked town carries the nine renderer-drawn layers, or none of them
# LOCAL / QUALIFIED UNREAL ONLY — NOT WORKABLE BY THE REMOTE WEB WORKER.
# HOLD references below are comments, not claimable queue entries. Tickets are blocked-tech.
# HOLD T-1472 — on-demand latest-validated Mac build/release; qualified Mac + release access.
# HOLD T-1473 — sinking buildings/terrain contact; qualified Unreal + matched web/source views.
# HOLD T-1358 — after T-1357 and current Unreal/GPU capability receipt.
# HOLD T-1360 — after T-0252, T-1357, T-1358; Unreal visual/collision receipt required.
# HOLD T-1474 — flora corridor; after shared exports/import and placement, Unreal visual/performance proof.
# HOLD T-1475 — map/search/place inspection; runtime provenance and Unreal input/route validation.
# HOLD T-1359 — streaming corruption; affected Mac/Unreal/browser access, after native priorities.
# HOLD T-1361 — after T-1358/T-1359, approved licensed build runner, GPU host, budget and credentials.
# Coordinator: unblock only when all dependencies AND current executor capability are proven;
# immediately assign/claim on that eligible executor; otherwise retain blocked-tech.
# Return unblocked work to this band in the displayed order; do not leave local work open
# for the general loop. The held epic is a tracker, never a claimable task.
# --- 9. LOOP IMPROVEMENTS — scene budgets, gates, build cost, and rendering
T-1222 — Read the letter-list mint's 798-file drift and give the pass a check the gate can run at its own place in the pipeline
T-1341 — ticket.mjs --check REPAIRS the mirror it is checking, so on any branch that adds a ticket the gate's queue step mutates tickets.json while the pool reads it — the T-0856 check-that-repairs fault, one tool over
T-1344 — Splitting a ticket that has a live branch puts two runs on one acceptance: the in-flight run retargets onto a child while the child also enters the queue for a fresh claim, and neither claim contends with the other
T-1345 — step_isolation exempts gitignored build products by a hand-kept path list, when git check-ignore can classify them: a write to an ignored path is a build product and a write to a tracked one is a tree mutation, and the gate should ask rather than be told
T-1355 — The four derived research reports conflict on every merge: decide whether they come off the PR surface the way T-0937 and T-0938 took the board and the mirror, with the reading written down
T-1362 — The lap re-derives only when it merges, so a branch already current with dev stays stale against a gate dev just added: #1487 sat red on four manifest-owned files while the lap said 'already current — nothing to lap'
T-1380 — A squash merge dropped a shipped release note and re-used its version: v971 named 'Six dates that would not stick' on dev at 06:06 and names 'How many people each tavern and boarding house could sleep' at 06:31, and the first entry is gone from the file the launcher and Manager parse
T-1282 — The lap cannot re-derive a resident household card, so any PR that conflicts on hh_*.json is refused whole
T-1118 — A bake whose ref merged mid-run still spends the whole bake before the PR is withheld
T-0231 — T-0229's expiry was blocked on a flora ticket, so the raised ceilings would never have come down
T-0673 — The triangle-budget fork was never filed as a ticket, so the owner's answer had nothing to land against: record the ruling and spend it only where a breach is measured
T-0672 — The three ceilings were raised for one parcel on 2026-09-03 and light's floor was spent: re-measure once #432 lands and take every tier back down
T-0237 — The full ceiling has 1,145 triangles clear on the published mirror, twelve hours after T-0229 raised it
T-0438 — The letter-list cohort is 2.54 MiB of the published tree, and it is now the largest single item in it
T-0777 — assets/manifest.web.json's $note is rewritten with escaped em-dashes, so its own generator does not reproduce what dev committed
T-0776 — A full tools/web_derivatives.sh rewrites 348 derivatives with identical byte counts: the derivative step is not reproducible
T-0829 — A repeated string in a provenance or coverage list is the same merge artefact as a repeated id, and nothing asserts it
T-0239 — Nothing tests the party-line note's prose against the placement it describes
T-0253 — May an invented building stand on the river margin of a platted street corridor
T-0190 — A second street tier for the street edge, and the ceiling that refuses it
T-0285 — An asset carrying its own AO map cannot batch with the town: +2 draw calls for one building
T-0286 — The AO unwrap leaves 68.9 per cent of every atlas empty, and the map is priced as if it were full
T-0364 — Two byte-identical copies of changelog.js are 7.2 per cent of the published payload, and they grow on every release
T-0053 — A patched lit material silently inherits another layer's shader program
T-0371 — The lattice path's block rotation is dead code that measure_rank_bias.mjs's drift guard pins in place
T-0433 — T-0346's measured costs for the new desktop parts 4, 5 and 6 were never filed, and the two places they are written down disagree
T-0030 — A queue card in Manager reading tickets.json
# --- 10. RESEARCH COMPLETION — remaining readings, identity epics, and deposit closeout
T-1219 — The three re-spelled cards still say in prose that the papers print the reading T-1139 overturned: hh_fraser_wm_h reads 'Wm. H. Frazer' and its own note says the papers print 'Wm. H. Fraser'
T-1281 — Is the Democrat's 'A. Sweet' of 4 June 1834 Alanson Sweet or the Alon[s]on Sweet of the same column
T-1315 — Spend the three dated birth and age enrichments T-1301 routed to T-1168: robinson_alexander, kimberly_edmund_s and maxwell_philip each carry a sourced birth date or age no field held when the reading was made, and both fields exist now
T-1335 — Spend the kin the church registers, the papers' family columns and the completed resident enrichments state — the 166 units T-1320's book pass was never scoped for, plus the two book relatives it left unruled: ties written onto held cards, nobody minted
T-1273 — Write every committed home and workplace reconciliation row as an associated_with row on the record it belongs to, changing no value, confidence or source
T-1274 — Move the renderers and tools off the singular lives_at/works_at once the plural rows carry every claim, and retire the pair

# --- MERGED IN, NOT YET PLACED. These arrived on the branch being merged and were
# --- appended here rather than guessed into a band. Rank them or leave them.
T-1460 — The two conjectural west-prairie swales now start in open ground at E -320 and swale_a's corridor covers eight West Division roofs: review the invented alignments the terrain extension stranded
T-1490 — Trace Jefferson Street north to Ohio so the corporate boundary's west leg stops being a 1,188 m extrapolation, and seat the five West Division roofs held on it
T-1500 — The 278 persons the order book's bed buckets still order have no live owner: T-1175 split, and every piece of its tree that fills a bed has closed
T-1501 — The desktop smoke's part 3 no longer finishes inside the 600 s foreground ceiling: it stalls in the reconstruction-contract block and reports the body-completion sentinel, so no steward run can measure it
T-1502 — The register deal reads the raw text of every household card as a name pool, so any pass writing a proper name onto one can silently retire a documented man from it

# --- MERGED IN, NOT YET PLACED. These arrived on the branch being merged and were
# --- appended here rather than guessed into a band. Rank them or leave them.
T-1504 — A stage that reads the St Mary's baptismal register: the four R6 rows whose Indigenous identity the source states in its own hand are refused only because underdocumented reads the 1832 muster roll and nothing reads the register
T-1505 — The borderline roster refuses 254 rows as 'a surname and no person' and three of them are forenames: Matanacqua, Lieu and Miranda are each named as the parent of a named child, so the refusal is right and its sentence is false
T-1506 — Retire the surplus reconstructed lawyer: businesses/lawyer is held at 2 drawn against an order of 1, because T-1299 admitted a documented attorney the town can name

# --- MERGED IN, NOT YET PLACED. These arrived on the branch being merged and were
# --- appended here rather than guessed into a band. Rank them or leave them.
T-1507 — Hiram Pearsons is a house painter a reminiscence names and a speculator this project inferred, and the card carries the inference at attested: re-adjudicate the 1835 trade field through the role readings
T-1510 — The stuck reporter cannot see a red gate: a PR whose gate failed and whose owning run has finished is the one state no automation in this repo owns
T-1511 — The trade share counts buildings that front no street: nineteen Fort Dearborn reservation roofs 270-420 m from Lake Street vote in the principal class, because nearest_frontage has no distance bound
T-1515 — Read Fergus 1839 as a dated directory role like its 1843 and 1844 siblings, so a printing is carried as evidence whether or not the 1835 field is empty

# --- MERGED IN, NOT YET PLACED. These arrived on the branch being merged and were
# --- appended here rather than guessed into a band. Rank them or leave them.
T-1514 — Tier the anonymous compiled business records in compile_businesses.py: 37 records whose only link to the advertisement that compiled them is an untiered claim_ids at the record root, so the 49 readings that built them can never be asserted
