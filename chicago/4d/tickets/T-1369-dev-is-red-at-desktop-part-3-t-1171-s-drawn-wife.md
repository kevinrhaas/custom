Dev is red at desktop part 3: T-1171's drawn wife lands on an evidence-only household (hh_inf_cooper_north_04), and the placeholder label no longer agrees with its asset.

**Acceptance:** the rule the smoke asserts and the rule `reconstruct_modelled_families.py`
applies are the same rule — an evidence-only container (`hh_inf_*`, named "Evidence-only
household — <head>") is refused by the stage's own eligibility, no `hh_inf_*` record carries a
person any stage drew, the refusal is counted in the ledger and stated in L244 and in the module's
own list of what it may not do, the whole derived layer re-derives (`check.sh` green), and
`SMOKE_VIEWPORT=desktop SMOKE_STAGE=3` passes `nothing was drawn into an evidence-only household`.
The label check named in the title is T-1331's and is out of scope here.

**Closed, 2026-09-21, and re-measured before closing.** The fix merged on #1605 at
03:12Z but the run that made it ended without closing the ticket, so T-1369 sat `claimed` at
row 0 of the queue with its work already on dev — the shape AUTOMATION.md calls rotting, and
the reason every slice-1 run since has re-opened it. Re-measured on dev at 2d4ea3d05 before
closing, rather than taken on the merge: `reconstruct_modelled_families.py --self-test` is
25/25 green including all four evidence-only rules; the layer on disk carries 5 evidence-only
containers and **none** of them holds a reconstructed person; and the desktop part 3 leg the
acceptance names was run here and its reading filed in `tools/dev-smoke-state.json`, which had
no reading newer than 2026-09-20T21:25 — a browser-crash verdict taken *before* #1605 landed,
which is why the assertion still read red to `smoke_budget`.

**Done, 2026-09-21.** The stage was the wrong half: `division: unplaced` was admitted and nothing
knew what an `hh_inf_` record is. A seventh refusal was added beside the letter-list one, which it
is the sibling of — both refuse a record that argues for a person and not for a household. Ten
drawn kin were retired from four of the five containers; the order book re-spent their quota on
documented heads it had been refusing, so the stage now draws for 119 heads instead of 89 and
writes 296 people instead of 300. The whole derived layer was re-derived behind it, and the order
book's self-test stopped carrying a hand-typed town figure (2,267) that this change moved.

**Found by** T-1347's run, 2026-09-19, on the first `SMOKE_VIEWPORT=desktop SMOKE_STAGE=3`
leg anybody has run since 2026-09-18T01:35. Two checks fail, and BOTH are dev's, not that
branch's: it changed no byte of `data/residents/households/` or `data/assets/`.

```
FAIL desktop 1280x800: nothing was drawn into an evidence-only household
     — 1 reconstructed people on hh_inf_cooper_north_04, name_basis present: true
FAIL desktop 1280x800: the placeholder label agrees with the asset it describes
```

**The first.** `hh_inf_cooper_north_04` is an *inferred* household — an evidence-only
container — and it now carries `rc_inf_cooper_north_04_wife`, drawn by T-1171's
`modelled_families` stage. The smoke's rule is that nothing may be DRAWN into a household
that exists only to hold evidence; the stage's own eligibility rules do not exclude
`hh_inf_*`. Either the rule or the stage is wrong and the two have to be reconciled — the
stage's `--check` is green, so this is a disagreement about what an inferred container is,
not a reproduction failure.

**The second** is unrelated to the residents and was not investigated here.

**Why it stood a day.** Part 3 has no reading in `dev-smoke-state.json` newer than the tree
T-1171 and T-1172 landed on. The readings are now filed: desktop 3 `fail`, desktop 13 and
mobile 13 `pass`, all on sha256:733344d4499f0392.

**Scope note (2026-09-20).** Of the two failures in the title, the second — *the placeholder
label agrees with the asset it describes* — has since been root-caused by **T-1331**: the
check reads a field that does not exist, so it has been permanently red on a typo rather
than on anything about the asset. Take the evidence-only household here and leave the label
to T-1331; the two sit together at the top of the queue. Both are among the four assertions
that have been standing red on dev, which is why every PR's smoke budget reports its legs
"already red on dev" and skips them.
