The owner, 2026-09-17: *"make sure all of the businesses are complete that we have audited against
the attested and inferred businesses data."* After T-1180 the 179 present-at-scene-date firms
are records; this ticket makes them COMPLETE and finds the businesses the research implies but the
register never printed.

**Denominators the audit is held against** (both already committed, both dated OUT of the scene
and used as brackets, never as instructions to invent):

- The State census of Sept–Dec 1835 (`data/research/books/claims/moses_kirkland_history_of_chicago_v1.json`
  claim `bk_mose1_006`; crosswalk `trade_census_1835_crosswalk.json`, T-1006/T-1007): 44 stores,
  2 book stores, 4 druggists, 2 silversmiths, 2 tin-and-copper shops, 2 printing offices, 2
  breweries, 1 steam saw-mill, 1 iron foundry, 4 forwarding houses, 8 taverns, 1 lottery office,
  1 bank, 5 churches, 7 schools, 22 lawyers, 14 physicians, 1 lyceum. The town today: 59 stores,
  2 druggists (−2), 1 silversmith (−1), 1 brewery (−1), 18 lawyers (−4), 3 physicians (−11), and
  three DOCUMENTED ZEROS (bank, lottery office, lyceum — "not an invitation to invent").
- The *Chicago American* of 15 August 1835 (via Andreas; quoted in `tremont_house_1.json`):
  upward of fifty business houses, four forwarding houses, eight taverns, two printing offices,
  two book-stores, one steam saw-mill, one brewery, one furnace, twenty-five mechanics' shops.

**Acceptance:**

1. For every present business record: proprietors and partners adjudicated against
   `identity.json` (47 firm merges, 12 proprietor merges), dates from first/last printing with
   `opening_announced`/`dissolved` honoured, `type` = its census class, `goods`, and every
   location the research names — the premises AND the secondary places (a warehouse on the
   river, a yard, an office at a hotel, an auction stand) — as `locations[]` with the limit class.
   A reconciliation table: field × (filled attested / filled inferred / empty with reason).
2. **Persons' other significant locations** (the owner's "any other locations they were
   significantly involved in"): for every person, the civic offices held and where they sat
   (the council house, post office, land office, court — `civic_public_buildings_1835.md`), church
   membership/office, agency holdings (`1835_agencies.json`), land purchased
   (`1835_land_sales_by_tract.json`), schools taught — written as `associated_with[]` on the
   person with kind, place/structure id, dates, tier and source. Counts before/after printed.
3. **A business for every in-window trade.** Every person whose `roles[]` reaches 1835-07-01
   with a trade that implies premises (the `works_trades` + `public_trades` of the signage rule,
   plus lawyer/physician offices) and who holds no business role gets one: `inferred` where a
   source says they practised in Chicago (the shop is the person's own — "J. Mason, blacksmith" →
   `biz_mason_blacksmith`, location street-only or unplaceable per the evidence), never
   `attested`. Trades that carry no premises (labourer, teamster, clerk, boatman) get
   `no_fixed_premises` on the role instead. `scene_window_trade_audit.json` (T-0872) must read
   zero.
4. The physicians' gap (3 vs 14) and lawyers' gap (18 vs 22) are worked FROM THE RESEARCH first:
   every physician/attorney the layer names in window gets an office record here; what remains
   short is written to the order book for T-1186, not invented here.
5. **Black-owned and Native/Métis-run businesses identified.** Every business whose proprietor
   the sources place in either community (the Indian traders' houses, the interpreters, the
   barber, any firm a register or biography so describes) carries `proprietor_community` at the
   tier the evidence supports, so the Businesses view can list them on one filter; the attested
   set is the floor T-1177 reconstructs above.
6. The Sept–Dec 1835 crosswalk is re-run and its deltas re-printed; documented zeros stay zero.
7. Report `docs/RESEARCH/business-audit-2026-09.md`; `--check` re-derives; gates in `check.sh`.

**Stop condition:** no attested or inferred business fact in the research is absent from a
business record, and no in-window tradesman is without a workplace or a stated reason.
