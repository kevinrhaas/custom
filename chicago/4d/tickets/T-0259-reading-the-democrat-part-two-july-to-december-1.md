An extraction pass over the Chicago Democrat July through December 1834 — Vol I No 31 (1834-07-02) through Vol II No 4 (1834-12-24), ~26 issues. T-0257's schema and compiler exist; this ticket
READS, extracting every claim of these kinds into per-issue extraction files:

- **persons** — every named individual: advertisers, officials, jurors, meeting
  attendees, marriage/death notices, arrivals, AND THE POST-OFFICE LETTER LISTS
  IN FULL (ruling 1: a listed name mints a resident candidate; mark
  `letter_list_only`). Tedious is not optional — the lists are the census proxy.
- **businesses** — proprietor(s), trade, goods, the address text VERBATIM plus
  the placement class and anchor, the ad's own copy date, and any dissolution/
  removal/succession notice (ruling 3's veto lives here).
- **buildings** — to-let notices, new-building notices, raisings, fires,
  materials, storeys, "the building lately occupied by…" chains.
- **street & infrastructure details** — bridges, the pier, ferries, wharfing,
  street work, ordinances, the estray pen, pumps, wells, crossings.
- **events / shipping / prices** where they carry town texture worth a card.

All have committed `.txt` transcriptions and the 1834 manifest + validation
notes cover them.

## OCR judgment, bounded

The transcriptions interleave column fragments in places (two ads shuffled
line-by-line). Unshuffle by sense; record the result in `normalized` and keep
`quote` verbatim with its brackets. Correct only recognition-class errors the
context supports (the workflow's own rule: never fill a gap because a phrase
sounds likely). A reading you are not sure of stays inside `[uncertain: …]` in
normalized too — the marker is the honesty, do not launder it out.

This is the year the town incorporates growth the papers narrate weekly —
watch for businesses MOVING (a second address for a known name is a move or a
branch, never a silent overwrite; both mentions stand with their dates).

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — the definition of done, never weakened to pass)

- Every issue in the range has an extraction file, and `corpus.json` coverage
  for the range is asserted in the gate, not eyeballed.
- Letter lists are extracted IN FULL: for one sampled issue, the extracted count
  is checked against a hand count of the printed list and stated in the PR.
- Every claim passes the T-0257 gate (quote + locator + reading present,
  locators resolve).
- The gazetteer recompiles green; new merges all carry `merge_rule`.
- The PR states counts: claims, persons (letter-list vs corroborated),
  businesses, placements by class.
