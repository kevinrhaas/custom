`tools/measure_frontage_entitlement.py` asks the one question the recipes cannot
answer by being read: **does a party-line frontage run stand on the lots it was
dealt?**

It does not, and not by a little.

    8 runs · 23 units · 8 dealt lot(s) carry none of their run's own roofs

**17 lots dealt, 9 stood on, 8 carrying nothing of the run they belong to.**
Nearly half the frontage this layer is entitled to has never had a roof put on
it, and the schedule counts every one of those lots as spent.

**The gate passes.** Every run is inside its own ceiling — worst is
`blk_south_water_wells` at 5 of 9. This is a measurement with no red attached to
it, which is exactly why it needs writing down: nothing fails, so nothing was
ever going to surface it.

## Why the gap exists, and why it is not a defect in the recipes

It is what T-0079 built. Before the core density standard a run carried exactly
one roof per lot it was dealt, so *dealt* and *stood on* were the same list and
nothing distinguished them. T-0079 retired that — a row is a claim about the
FACE, bounded by the metres of frontage it stands on rather than by the
conjectural side lines it crosses — and the two lists came apart the moment it
landed. A run PACKS from one end of its own strip and `ROW_UNITS_PER_LOT` = 3 of
its units fit inside one lot of this grid, so three lots get entitled and one or
two get occupied.

Nothing measured them apart until a documented building wanted the difference.

## What this is NOT, so it is not worked twice

The five South Water stores are **already standing** — T-0199, closed by #371 —
and they appear in the table above as the roofs on lots 0 and 2 that their runs
were dealt. The owner's 2026-08-27 business-front clause (`exclusive_lots` in
`tools/plat_occupancy.py`) settled that a documented building at the street does
not exhaust a lot of a declared business front, and `generate_block_infill.py`
stopped refusing them.

**That clause answered the collision. It did not touch the bookkeeping.** The
schedule still deals 17 lots to put 9 lots' worth of roofs on them, and
`schedulable_on_committed_ground` is charged for all 17. The eight idle lots are
not a symptom of the refusal that #371 fixed; they were there before it and they
are there after it.

## Provenance: this instrument is a salvage, and one thing did not carry over

The module was written on `steward/t-0199-south-water-five` (#395) alongside the
five stores. That PR is closed on the owner's instruction: T-0199 landed by
another route, its own T-0222 is superseded by T-0223, and the ceiling readings
that held it are three weeks of content out of date. **The instrument was the
only part of it dev did not already have**, and this is it.

It came with a `plat_occupancy.seated_lots` of its own. That never reached dev —
and in the meantime #371 gave `plat_occupancy.lot_holders` the identical shape,
`{block: {lot: [ids]}}`, for the clause. So the salvage imports dev's function
rather than landing a second copy of the same map.

**The one behaviour that did not carry over is a dedupe, and it is not
cosmetic.** `footprints()` yields every committed phase, so a structure rebuilt
on a footprint seating on the same lot twice appears in that lot's list twice.
Every caller on dev reads that list for a NAME — `occupied_lots` takes `ids[0]`,
the clause asks what is standing there — and a name is unharmed by a repeat.
This module is the first caller that reads it as a COUNT, and a count is not: a
two-phase rebuild would spend a lot's frontage twice and report a run over a
ceiling it is inside. Measured on the committed dataset today: **no lot lists any
id twice**, so it changes no number here. It is guarded anyway, in this module
rather than pushed down into `lot_holders`, because narrowing a function eight
callers share to suit one new reader is how a fix becomes a regression.

**The 2026-08-24 figure is not carried across.** #395 reported *20 dealt, 12
stood on*; today's tree reads *17 and 9*. The eight idle lots survive both
readings, and the totals do not — dev has moved ~25 commits. Anyone citing this
finding cites the run, not the memory.

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — the definition of done, never weakened to pass)

The question this ticket does NOT settle, and the next run must answer before it
changes anything: **is a dealt-but-unbuilt lot a defect or a reservation?**
Both readings are defensible and they lead opposite ways.

- If it is a **defect**, the schedule is hoarding: it should deal a run the lots
  it will actually stand on, `schedulable_on_committed_ground` recovers up to
  eight lots of headroom, and documented buildings stop competing with ground
  nothing is using.
- If it is a **reservation** — the run's strip is *entitled* to that frontage
  and will fill it as the town densifies — then the count is correct and what is
  wrong is only that nobody could see it.

Whichever it is, it is argued in writing from the table, not assumed. Then:

- `--gate` is either wired into `tools/check.sh` or explicitly left out with a
  reason. It passes today, so wiring it in is cheap and it would catch the
  regression this module exists to make visible.
- The gate is demonstrated to FAIL on a fixture, not only to pass on a clean
  tree. A check nobody has seen fail has not been tested — `blk_lake_clark` and
  both `blk_randolph_dearborn` deals sit at exactly 3 of 3, so a synthetic roof
  on one of their lots is the fixture.
- If the answer is "defect", the eight lots are recovered and
  `schedulable_on_committed_ground` is re-measured — **not asserted from the
  count of 8**, since the schedule may not be able to use all of them.
