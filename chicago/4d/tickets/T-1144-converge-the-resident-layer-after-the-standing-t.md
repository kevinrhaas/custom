Converge the resident layer after the standing truth tickets: zero synthesis and mint drift, no false Chicago resident, and no 1835 claim above its dated evidence.

**Measured on `dev`, 2026-09-15.** A fresh resident synthesis would change 150 files although
`synthesis_drift_baseline.json` is empty. The documented and letter-list mint checks would change
41 and 798 files respectively, but `check.sh` invokes `synthesize_resident_research.py --check`
under both labels instead of the passes whose output the labels promise. A green generic synthesis
therefore does not mean either cohort agrees with its derivation.

This is the convergence pass, not a second ticket for each source-reading question. It consumes
the standing truth tickets after they land: T-1129 (four Bear Creek people are not Chicago
residents), T-1115 (uncertainty brackets), T-1121 (Leonard C. Hugunin), T-1136 (presence brackets),
T-1137 (one writer deleting another's findings), T-0662/T-0691 (the two mint drifts), and T-1145
(dated roles, which supplies T-0991's honest home for pre-scene occupations). If one is still open,
do not re-decide it here: state the dependency and leave this ticket open.

**Acceptance:**

1. Run all three writers against throwaway copies, review their exact diffs, and make the
   committed resident layer a fixed point: synthesis drift 0, documented-mint drift 0 and
   letter-list-mint drift 0. Do not bless drift with a nonzero baseline.
2. Correct `check.sh` so each label invokes its own writer's `--check`/drift contract. A self-test
   changes one output of each writer and proves the matching gate fires.
3. Rebuild away Mary Durbin, John Simmons, John Vincent and Cery Logdson unless a new independent
   Chicago source is committed; no resident may rest solely on church readings whose
   `at_chicago` values are all false.
4. Apply the bracket, name and writer-ownership repairs from T-1115, T-1121, T-1136 and T-1137
   through the generators, never as hand edits. Re-run every affected presence and identity rule.
5. `audit_scene_window_trades.py --check` reaches zero after T-1145: a pre-scene or later role may
   remain dated on the person, but it cannot call itself an attested 1 July 1835 occupation.
6. Rebuild `index.json`, sidecars, town census, published residents and the final resident audit;
   the closing report gives the exact household/person/grade deltas and names every retired id's
   redirect. Relevant resident and ticket gates pass.

**Owner review, 2026-09-17 — added acceptance** (the owner asked that the research-spend tickets
be reviewed and enhanced before the reconstruction bands below them run):

7. The convergence report names, per person, which of the plural `roles[]` (T-1145) and which
   home/work/other locations (T-1147) reach 1 July 1835, so the sign-off ticket T-1157 can read
   coverage per axis off one table rather than re-deriving it.
8. The `reconstructed` grade stays at zero in this ticket and the three writers refuse to emit it:
   reconstruction begins only at T-1167 under its own programme file, never inside a mint.
9. Every household `present_on_scene_date: uncertain` keeps the dated evidence leg that made it
   uncertain (the last appearance and its date) as a structured field, because T-1159 classifies
   the 893 uncertain presences by that date.

**Stop condition:** the three resident derivations agree byte-for-byte with the tree and every
standing confirmed false/overstated resident assertion has either moved or gained new evidence.

**Links:** T-0660 · T-0662 · T-0691 · T-0838 · T-0991 · T-1115 · T-1121 · T-1129 · T-1136 · T-1137 · T-1145.


## IT WAS FOLDED INTO T-1157 AND THE GATE REFUSED IT (2026-09-17)

Same refusal as T-1241, and the same invariant. `research_spend_ledger.py` holds that *a
unit may only defer to work that is still going to happen*, and unresolved research units
name THIS TICKET BY ID as the work they wait on. Closing it as folded made those units defer
to finished work, and `measure_research_spend.py --check` failed on every one.

**A ticket that research units defer to by id cannot be consolidated away** — not without
repointing every unit that names it, which is a bigger and riskier change than a shorter
queue is worth. That is the real constraint on tightening this band, and it is worth knowing
before anyone tries again.

**The tightening that DOES apply:** run this in the SAME PASS as T-1157 and T-1241. The drift
checks here are the sign-off report's evidence section, not a separate expedition, and one run
produces all three.
