Finish the heightfield SOUTH to Madison Street, the plat's last tier. The mirror of
T-0010 / ROADMAP T-E3's eastern extension, and **the only route to any of the South's
120 remaining roofs.**

**Why, measured (T-0026, `tools/measure_southern_ground.py`).** The modelled box ends at
local **N -400 m**, and that line falls *inside* Washington Street's own 80 ft platted
corridor — 0.33 ha of that street's south half, over 899 m of its length, is already off
the field. South of the corridor the field holds **0.0819 ha** of land above the water
surface and **0.0000 ha** of it is in the South Division: every cell is west of local
E -10, the West Division bank across the South Branch. Madison Street — the 1830 plat's
south boundary, resolved from the PLSS section corner at State & Madison — is **125.2 m**
further south again, so the plat's last tier of blocks (**6 blocks, 48 lots, 6.28 ha**,
Market to State) has **0 of 24** block-boundary points on modelled ground.

**What it needs from the traces, and it is narrow.** The box's `n_min` is capped by
evidence rather than by cost, and the evidence is about ONE river: the spec says a box
reaching further south *"would show open prairie where the river actually continues"*, and
that river is the South Branch, whose traced water ends at **N -405.2** (west bank) /
**-404.3** (east bank). Everything else already reaches past Madison — the harbour-reach
shoreline to **N -589.2**, the sand bar to **N -436**. So the work is the South Branch's
two banks carried from N -405 to about **N -531 (126 m per bank)** off a sheet this project
already holds, then `n_min` moved in `terrain_spec.json`, then a bake. The tier itself is
dry ground: at N -400 the branch occupies local E -8 to +35 and the tier runs E +88
(Market) to +826 (State).

**Street control is NOT the blocker and must not be carried first.** Every north-south
column of the south plat has its committed centreline cut at exactly N -400, the field's
own south edge; the modern control that would carry them further is already committed
(`G1` is an OpenStreetMap node with an id and a 13.9 m residual). Carry the lines without
the ground and `tools/generate_plat_lots.py` emits six blocks whose every placement
`tools/generate_block_infill.py` refuses for standing outside the modelled terrain —
`tools/measure_southern_ground.py --gate` now fails at the commit if that happens.

Ground **east of State** is not part of this and is not coming at any date: it is the
United States Reservation (T-E2, `data/reconstruction/1835_no_build_ground.json`).

**Acceptance:** the committed heightfield covers the plat's Washington–Madison tier;
`tools/measure_southern_ground.py` reports the tier's block-boundary points on modelled
ground and the figure is no longer zero; `tools/reconcile_665.py` re-derives and the South
balance's `waiting_on` moves off terrain of its own accord; `tools/check.sh` green. The
South Branch's extended banks are traced and sourced like every other trace — **or** the
reason they cannot be is recorded and this ticket closes with it, in which case the South's
120 roofs are gated permanently and the programme should say so.

**Prior attempt: PR [#432](https://github.com/kevinrhaas/custom/pull/432), closed unmerged 2026-09-05 under T-0803.**
Opened 2026-08-28; by the time it was read it stood **672 commits behind `dev`** with 54
changed files, re-tracing the river and rebuilding the heightfield and the terrain/water
GLBs on top of a `dev` that has since moved the South Branch's east bank (T-0686, #882)
and re-derived north_water twice (T-0780, #889). **Read its PR body before starting** — it
is the reasoning archive for this ticket and it is not thrown away. In particular it
records four faults the extension exposed and fixed, each of which will recur: the raster
cache ignored `REGION`; `upsample` measured the block grid against the image rather than
the block size; a sheet stain read as riverbank and fused a 190 m false lobe across four
platted blocks; and `open_lake` would have built 465 m of invented coastline where no
traced water reaches the guard. It also filed **T-0253** for a 5.1 m regression on
`blk_south_water_franklin`'s north face.

Its branch could NOT be deleted from the session that closed it — this environment's proxy refuses a ref delete over both git and the REST API (HTTP 403) — so `ticket.mjs claim` **will see it as a rival branch and refuse**. That refusal is a false stop: the PR is closed and the branch is abandoned. `claim T-0219 --force` is correct here. `ticket.mjs inflight` reads it as COLD, which is the honest signal.
