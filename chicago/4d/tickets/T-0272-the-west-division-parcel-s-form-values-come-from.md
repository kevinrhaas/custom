The West Division parcel's form values come from the archetype and cite the family band: 8 families, 11 claims outside it.

The values are authored in `tools/generate_west_infill.py`, `_form_body`.

**Found by T-0172 (2026-08-28)**, which generalised `tools/measure_family_deal.py` from the
platted-block generator to all four anonymous parcels. The sweep's first assertion is green
everywhere — **0 refusals**: every archetype builds every size any of the four parcels may
deal it, at 400 synthetic deals per family. What it found instead is the second assertion,
K25's: 11 values whose note cites the family band and which sit outside it. Each is a
per-family CONSTANT, so it is made on 100 per cent of that family's deals, not on a tail.

The repair is one shape, and it is the one T-0144 and T-0145 already applied to the block
parcel: replace the literal with `family_bands.pitch_deg` / `wall_height_m`, sampled inside
the family's own band and bounded at both ends by `family_bands.eave_limits` so the
archetype's floor and ceiling hold. Ask the archetype for the limits; never retype them.

**This moves geometry**, so it re-derives the parcel's records and re-bakes what moved in
the same commit — `tools/validate.py --stale` hard-fails otherwise, and `check.sh` runs it.
Then `tools/publish.sh`, then `tools/measure_family_deal.py --write-baseline` to shrink
`tools/family_deal_baseline.json` by exactly the rows repaired. The baseline is a ratchet:
it may shrink and may not grow.

**Acceptance:** `tools/measure_family_deal.py --parcel west` reports 0 refusals and 0
off-band claims, its rows are gone from `tools/family_deal_baseline.json`, the moved records
are re-derived and re-baked in the same commit, and `tools/measure_band_claims.py --gate`
has not grown.

**The claims, each with the literal behind it:**

| family | claim | the literal |
|---|---|---|
| A2 | pitch 32.0 outside 33.69-45 deg | `18.0 if roof == "shed" else 32.0`, outbuilding tail |
| A5 | eave 2.05 m outside 2.134-2.743 | `wall = ... else 2.05`, man door |
| C2 | eave 3.25 m outside 3.353-3.962 | `inferred(3.25)`, C branch |
| C2 | pitch 33.0 outside 33.69-42.51 deg | `inferred(33.0)`, C branch |
| D2 | eave 2.05 m outside 2.134-2.438 | D2 falls past the D branch to the outbuilding tail |
| D2 | pitch 18.0 outside 18.435-33.69 deg | the same fall-through: `roof_kind("D2")` is a shed |
| D3 | eave 2.78 m outside 2.438-2.743 | `stories, wall, pitch = 1, 2.78, 38.0` |
| D7 | eave 5.05 m outside 5.182-5.791 | `stories, wall, pitch = 2, 5.05, 38.0` |
| H2 | eave 5.2 m outside 5.486-6.401 | **LATENT** — `if family in ("H2",)`; no H2 stands here |
| H2 | pitch 38.0 outside 26.565-36.87 deg | **LATENT**, same branch |
| W4 | eave 2.05 m outside 2.743-5.486 | man door again; the widest miss, a third of the band's floor |

The two H2 rows are the point of the sweep: **no H2 stands in this parcel**, so nothing in
the repo said the card was bad. That is the same shape T-0142 caught on the platted blocks,
found here before the recipe deals one. West resolves H2 through `frame_tavern` rather than
`frame_dwelling`, so the archetype builds it — only the note is wrong.
