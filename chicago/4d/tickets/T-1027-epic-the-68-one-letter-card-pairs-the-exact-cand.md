EPIC: the 68 one-letter card pairs the exact candidate test cannot see, ruled on pages one
cluster at a time.

**THE LOOP DOES NOT WORK THIS UNTIL THE OWNER PROMOTES IT.** It is filed under EPICS on the
queue's own filing rule — finishing it takes far more than five tickets — and it is ONE ticket
carrying the list rather than 68 lines the owner would have to rank.

**WHERE IT COMES FROM.** T-1002 folded three duplicate pairs the candidate test in
`tools/consolidate_town_cards.py` could not see, because that test buckets the cards by the
surname as a STRING and then weighs the forenames with `compatible()`, which admits a full
word against the same word, an initial the word begins with, or a card printing a title and no
forename. Nothing in it admits a LETTER. The ticket's third acceptance clause asked how large
that blind spot is rather than assuming three was all of it, and the answer is
`tools/measure_card_fuzzy_candidates.py`: run the same test with one letter of slack — on the
surname, and on the forename where the surname is exact — and over 1,373 cards it proposes 68
pairs the exact test does not, 62 folding the surname and 6 the forename, 12 of them already
carrying a written ruling.

**THE LIST IS NOT A WORKLIST OF 68 MERGES, AND THAT IS THE POINT.** It mixes at least four
kinds, which is why a run takes ONE cluster and rules it on a page:

  * **A spelling the sources really do set two ways** — Foot/Foote, Forsyth/Forsythe,
    Lloyd/Loyd, Pearson/Pearsons, Pruyne/Pryne, Eldredge/Eldridge, Wesencraft/Wessencraft,
    Kingston/Kingstone, Salisbury/Salsbury, Scarrett/Scarritt, Vanderbogart/Vanderbogert.
    These are the C7/C9/C10 shape and each wants the page that demonstrates the variation.
  * **A card minted off a garble** — `chark_john_a` for Clark, `tmple_john_t` for Temple,
    `smow_george_w` for Snow, `canp_george_s` for Camp, `mgregor_a` for McGregor,
    `blanshard_f_g` for Blanchard, `stoel_c_ii`, `trall_e_l`, `gabbs_james_i1`. Rule R5
    refuses these by rule and T-0695 is the ticket that reads them; a fold here would repair a
    wreck by guessing at it.
  * **An initial gathered across a folded surname** — J. Green against Major John Greene,
    J. B. Falker against two Walkers, J Ambrose Wight against three Wrights. The slack is on
    the surname and the forename inference is `compatible()`'s own, so the test cannot decline
    it; R2's two-rivals refusal does most of the work.
  * **Two people one letter apart** — J. H. Collins against John Rollins, John Hale against
    John Vale, Mark Noble against Mary Noble, James Sheldon against James Wheldon, Byram King
    against Hyram King. A distance cannot tell these from the first kind. It is the same answer
    T-1001 reached over the land register's 427 purchaser spellings, reached again over the
    cards, and it is the standing argument against ever widening `clusters()`.

**HOW A RUN WORKS IT, once promoted.** Take the topmost pair in the table below that carries no
ruling; find the page; rule it in `data/residents/card_merge_rulings.json` under an existing
rule or a new one drawn as narrowly as C6 through C11 are; land it with
`tools/consolidate_town_cards.py --apply`; rebuild the derived crosswalks that gather by name
(`tools/read_land_sales.py --build`, and check what else drifts); strike the row here. A run
that rules one pair and writes out what would have said two men is a whole unit of work. A run
that folds several on the resemblance has done the thing this epic exists to prevent.

**THE 68, as measured on the tree T-1002 shipped.** `ruled` names the cluster in
`card_merge_rulings.json` that already covers one or both cards — it does not mean the PAIR is
ruled, and several of those are refusals under R5 or R2 that a page could reopen. Regenerate
with `tools/measure_card_fuzzy_candidates.py --detail`.

**WHAT MUST NOT HAPPEN.** A fold is a card DELETION and the town's resident count moves by it.
Nothing in this list may be folded to tidy a duplicate away, nothing may be folded because its
neighbour in the table was, and `clusters()` may not be widened to close the epic in one pass —
the measurement that prices that widening is gated in `check.sh` precisely so the argument
stays available to whoever next wants to.
