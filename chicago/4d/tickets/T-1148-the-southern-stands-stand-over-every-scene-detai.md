The southern stands stand over every scene-detail ceiling, and no ground tiling moves it.

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — the definition of done, never weakened to pass)

Measured while T-0466 was choosing the ground's culling grid, at four poses down the new
southern field — 700 m, 1,800 m and 3,200 m south of the datum, and one aerial over it —
with `tools/measure_ground_tiling.mjs`. The readings are committed in
`data/render/ground_tiling_budget.json`.

**At the `light` tier — the FLOOR, ceiling 825,000 triangles — the worst southern stand
reads 1,387,934.** At `full`, ceiling 1,460,000, it reads 2,147,081. The stand that does
it is `mid_field_looking_north`: 1.8 km south of the town, on open ground, looking back
at it. From there the WHOLE town is in one frustum at once, and no stand this project
owns has ever been outside it looking in — `tools/smoke_renderer.mjs` STANDS are all
inside the town or above it.

**This is not the ground and it is not the tiling.** T-0466 tiled the ground better and
took triangles OFF every one of these readings; the remainder is the buildings, the
flora and the shadow pass, seen whole. Nor is it a number that any tiling can move: a
tile is culled when it is out of frustum, and from out there nothing is.

**What this ticket is not, either:** a re-budget. The instrument that took these figures
is not calibrated against the gate — its four DOWNTOWN readings also sit above what
`tools/measure_detail_ceilings.mjs` reports for the same stands, which is stated in the
reading's own `what_this_is_not`. So the first piece of work is to read the southern
stands on the GATE's instrument and find out what the real figure is. Only then is there
a question about ceilings, distance culling or a southern LOD, and it should be asked
with T-0467 (which puts real anchors down there) rather than before it.

**Acceptance:** the southern field has stand readings taken on the same instrument the
ceilings are held with; whatever they say is written down beside the downtown ones; and
if they are over, the answer is argued — a trim, a distance rule, or an argued
re-budget — rather than the ceiling being moved to fit.

**WHAT THE READING FOUND (2026-09-15).** Taken on `tools/measure_detail_ceilings.mjs`
with the new `--south` flag, at the same four poses, all three tiers, both gate
viewports; committed in `data/render/southern_stand_ceilings.json`.

The southern four ARE over -- worst 2,161,179 against 1,460,000 at `full` desktop, and
1,379,963 against 825,000 at `light`. The ground-tiling instrument was not reading high:
the two tools agree to within 0.7 per cent on every stand they share.

But the downtown five are over too, at every tier and both viewports -- 1,883,619 at
Lake Street at Canal against the same 1,460,000. So the excess is NOT southern, and
none of the three answers this ticket offered for it (a trim down there, a distance
rule, a southern re-budget) would touch the larger breach it sits on top of. That is
filed as **T-1154**, with the bisection and the trim as its acceptance. The southern
stands' own question -- whether poses with no anchors under them should be held to the
town's ceilings at all -- stays where this ticket put it, with T-0467.

No ceiling was moved.
