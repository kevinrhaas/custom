Open `blk_south_water_lasalle` — 8 roof(s) of headroom, 3 free lot(s) — under the anonymous-block
programme (T-0028). Piece 1 of 4 of **T-0420**, which held all four South Water blocks in one
ticket: four blocks is four demonstrations, and T-0028's programme rule is one run, one
demonstration, one successor. This ticket owns ONE block, which is one run.

**Why this ground is workable now, and it is the whole reason the parent exists.** T-0143 and
T-0188 each refused to tighten a party-line row against a street line that might move, and T-0317
inherited the refusal. T-0009 closed it on 2026-08-29 under the owner's ruling: the drawn South
Water line does NOT move — the corridor was re-derived from committed control (`recentred`, +8.58 m)
and `data/streets/1835.json` was not touched. The refusal is discharged for the four blocks that
front this reach. `blk_south_water_market` is NOT one of them and is not in this family of
tickets: T-0183 measured it out as a wedge the South Branch pinches to 2.8 m of depth at Market,
and what to do with that wedge is with the owner.

**The block, re-derived on 2026-08-30 by `tools/reconcile_665.py`** (not typed — every figure here
is read back out of `data/reconstruction/1835_665_roof_programme.json`, and a run that finds them
changed should trust the tool and correct this table):

| field | value |
|---|---|
| bounded by | south_water (N), lake (S), lasalle (W), clark (E) |
| lots | 8 |
| standing roofs | 9 |
| free lots | 3 |
| headroom | **8** — 6 principal, 2 ancillary |
| families dealt | A1, A2, C3, D1, D2, D3, D6, D7 — one roof each |
| frontage weight | 0.6023 |
| trade roofs in the deal (T-0213) | 1 |

**Acceptance:** (state it before working — one demonstration, never weakened to pass)

- The 8 roof(s) stand on `blk_south_water_lasalle`'s own committed lots, and the row stands ON THE BLOCK FACE
  rather than on a re-derived line — that is the distinction T-0143 and T-0188 were protecting and
  it survives the ruling unchanged.
- `tools/reconcile_665.py` re-derives and the census reconciles: this block moves to
  `at_capacity`, or its remaining headroom is stated and why.
- The roofs are BAKED in the same commit (`./tools/bake.sh --only <structure-id>` per structure —
  `validate.py --stale` hard-fails a record that no longer matches its committed mesh), and
  `tools/publish.sh` mirrors the result.
- A screenshot from the same spot shows roofs that were not there. This is a VISIBLE ticket and it
  is the payoff the whole programme was for; it does not need the invisible-run exemption.
- One successor is handed on, per T-0028: the next block in this family, or — for whichever of the
  four runs last — the statement of where the programme's committed ground runs out.
