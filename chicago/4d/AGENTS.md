# AGENTS.md — the contract for anyone working on 4D Chicago

Read this every session. It is one page on purpose.

## What this project is

A year-parameterized, walkable reconstruction of downtown Chicago. **It is a research
dataset with renderers attached** — not a game. The durable artifact is the georeferenced
land + structure data with per-attribute source provenance. Renderers are plural and
disposable. The first rendered scene is `1835` (target date 1835-07-01).

## Hard rules

1. **Never invent a source.** Every `source_id` must resolve in `data/sources/`. If evidence
   does not exist, mark the attribute `conjectural`. Fabricating a citation to make the
   validator pass is the worst thing you can do here.
2. **Never silently fill a gap.** Missing evidence is recorded as missing. `inferred` requires
   a `note` stating the reasoning. That is what the confidence model is for.
3. **Never drift past the scene date.** Most vivid published description of early Chicago is
   1837–1845 and describes a bigger town. `data/exclusions.json` records researched-and-excluded
   structures with citations — read it before adding anything, and add to it rather than
   deleting a finding.
4. **Every mesh is generated from `data/` by a command.** The one exception is
   `assets/authored/`, which is tagged `authored`, exempt from regeneration, and carries the
   same provenance requirements as generated geometry.
5. **Renderers consume glTF + JSON sidecars.** They never reach into `generators/` or
   reimplement the data model. Archetype parameters stay engine-neutral — the contract is
   glTF, not Blender.
6. **No asset without license provenance.** Every file under `assets/` has an entry in
   `assets/LICENSES.md`. A source whose `rights_status` is `check_required` may be cited in
   text but must not have assets derived from it.
7. **`tools/check.sh` passes before every commit.** It takes seconds and needs no Blender.

## Standing constraint — 1835 and Indigenous history

The final removal of the Potawatomi from Chicago occurred in **August 1835** — inside the
project's first target year. It is the most historically significant event of that year.

- **Do not improvise Native presence, representation, dialogue, or depiction.** This is not a
  research gap to be filled by inference; it is a subject requiring consultation.
- The Newberry's Indigenous Chicago curriculum is the starting point, and the project should
  seek review from Native scholars or community organizations before shipping any depiction.
- **Until then, v1 ships no human figures at all** — uniformly, not selectively. Build the
  built environment accurately and leave human depiction out of scope. An empty, accurate town
  is honest. A populated, invented one is not.
- `review_required: true` on any record blocks a scene from being marked `released`.

Note also that the great Potawatomi gathering and the last war dance are **August 1835**,
weeks after the 1835 scene date. Staging them in the 1835 scene would be wrong twice over.

## The work-parcel contract

Work is parceled so parallel agents never collide. If you are a subagent:

- **One file per source, one file per structure, one file per zone.** Your parcel's outputs are
  disjoint from every other parcel's by construction. Do not restructure shared files.
- **Writing agents get their own git worktree.** A shared checkout across parallel agents has
  produced false alarms and lost work in this fleet before.
- Your parcel is done when `tools/check.sh` passes and your outputs carry their provenance.
- Do not run Blender unless your parcel changes geometry-affecting data. Bakes are batched.

## The two-speed build

| | `tools/check.sh` | `tools/bake.sh` |
|---|---|---|
| when | every commit, every sandbox | on demand + nightly |
| needs Blender | **no** | yes, pinned (`generators/blender.pin`) |
| runtime | seconds | minutes |
| does | schema, provenance, date gates, referential integrity, licenses, archetype params, staleness, JS parse, publish sync | generate → UV → bake AO/normals → GLB → web derivatives → sidecars → publish |

Agents consume committed GLBs. A stale committed GLB is a check failure, not a warning.

## Honesty rules

- `docs/LIBERTIES.md` is append-only. Every compression and invention gets recorded. The
  standard: *a visitor should be able to tell you which parts we made up.*
- `docs/STATUS.md` states what is unverified. Do not describe a gate as passed if it was skipped.
- Where sources disagree, record the disagreement in `docs/RESEARCH/<id>.md` and pick the
  best-attested reading **with reasoning** — never silently choose.
- No model identifiers in repo artifacts.

## Orientation

`docs/PLAN.md` is the full development plan. `docs/research/` holds the source dossiers
(committed verbatim, tagged, with their own gaps stated). `docs/PROVENANCE.md` expands the
confidence model. `docs/EPOCHS.md` explains the temporal architecture.
