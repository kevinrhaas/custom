# Liberties taken

**Append-only.** Every compression, simplification, and invention gets a row. Nothing is ever
removed from this file; if a liberty is later resolved by evidence, add a line saying so.

The standard, borrowed from the Joliet project in this repo:

> A visitor should be able to tell you which parts we made up.

The per-attribute confidence model in the data covers *attributes*. This file covers the
decisions that do not live in any single attribute — scope, scale, omission, and the choices a
reader would otherwise have to reverse-engineer.

## The `Covers:` field — what an entry claims to discharge

An entry that admits to an invention says so in machine-readable form:

```
**Covers:** `sauganash_hotel.log_1829.footprint`, `sauganash_hotel.log_1829.form.roof_type`, ```

Each token is `structure_id[.phase_id].aspect`. The aspect is either one of the record's fixed
blocks — `footprint`, `position`, `documented_range`, or the structure-level `function` and
`occupants` — or any attribute of the building's form, written with its prefix:
`form.roof_type`, `form.gallery`, `form.wall_height_m`. Naming the phase covers that phase;
leaving it out covers whichever of the structure's phases stated that aspect without evidence.

The commit gate reads these claims in both directions: every `conjectural` value in
`data/structures/` must be claimed by some entry, and every claim must land on a value that is
actually invented. The prose stays the explanation and the field is the assertion — the gate
used to infer coverage from an entry's *wording*, which a liberty could satisfy by mentioning a
footprint while discussing something else.

The requirement reaches past the drawn geometry on purpose. A conjectural `roof_type` is not a
gap in the model: a gable gets built and a visitor sees a gable. A conjectural `gallery: false`
is the same claim in the negative — the front of the building is rendered plain because nobody
found evidence either way. The confidence chip says *we do not know*; only the liberty says what
we did about not knowing.

The rule runs in the other direction too, and this is the half that took longest to find a
mechanism for. An invention is a value with no evidence behind it. An **omission** is the
opposite — evidence with no geometry in front of it — and it leaves no trace in a record that
looks any different from a well-attested one. So the claim comes from the generator rather than
from a reader's attention: each archetype declares the attributes it actually reads, and any
attribute outside that set must say on the record what the mesh does instead —

```
"stables": { "value": true, "confidence": "documented", "geometry": "absent", … }
```

`absent` means nothing of it is built; `simplified` means something stands in its place that
this value does not drive; `record_only` means it was never a build instruction — a rejected
reading or a negative finding, which owes nothing. The first two are admissions, and the gate
holds each of them to a `Covers:` token exactly as it holds an invention. That is what closes
the gap this document had against a `documented` chip sitting over something a visitor cannot
see.

An entry with no `Covers:` field claims nothing and is still a liberty: navigation rules and
scope decisions have nothing in the data to point at. When evidence settles a claimed invention,
or the model catches up with an omission, move the entry to **Resolved** — the gate exempts that
section, which is what lets an append-only document survive its data being corrected.

## The `Scope:` field — a liberty owed by a population rather than a record

A few liberties are not about a building at all. The newspaper register mints one of them:
every business the papers document before 1835 is taken to be still standing on the scene
date unless something contradicts it. There is no `Covers:` token to write, because not one
of those businesses has been raised as a structure yet — and writing one near-identical
entry per business the day they are would bury this register under its own bookkeeping,
which is the fault the `recon_*` class wildcard was added to avoid.

Such an entry names its POPULATION instead, in the second field read as data:

```
**Scope:** `register_1835.businesses[survival_liberty_required]` — 111 businesses
```

The token is `<derived file>.<collection>[<predicate>]`, and it may only name an
enumeration `tools/compile_liberties.py` knows how to count — `SCOPE_SOURCES` there is the
list, and it is a closed one on purpose. An entry free to spell its own predicate would be
marking its own homework: whatever the prose selected is exactly what the prose counted,
for ever.

The count after the dash is the load-bearing half, and it is written by hand deliberately.
The compiler re-derives it on every run and a disagreement is a gate failure, so the number
a reader trusts and the data it describes are two statements that have to agree — the same
discipline the `Resolved:` line runs on. A count read silently out of the data would agree
with itself for ever and tell a reader nothing; a hand-typed one with nothing behind it
reads as a measurement and is not one. Only both together say anything.

A scope does not replace a `Covers:` token, and the two coexist. The day one of these
businesses is raised as a building, whatever that record invents is claimed the ordinary
way; the scope stays the admission about the population, and it shrinks on its own as the
corpus grows — which is the moment the count has to be restated, and the moment the gate
asks for it.

## Where a new entry goes, and why Resolved is not the last section

**A new liberty is appended at the END OF THIS FILE**, which is the end of the per-subject
register, and that is the whole rule. It was not always safe: **Resolved** used to be the last
section, so an entry appended at the end of the file landed inside the one section the gate
exempts, and **23 of the 71 entries numbered L111 and above compiled as already settled** —
including L127, written for a fence that stands in the town today (T-0054). Nothing said so on
screen except a chip on the card reading *resolved*, and nothing could: the markdown and the
compiled JSON agreed exactly, because both read the fault the same way.

So **Resolved sits above the per-subject register** rather than below it. Appending, which is the
operation this document mandates, now lands where a new liberty belongs. An entry becomes
resolved by BOTH gaining a `**Resolved:**` line that says what settled it AND being moved into
that section, and `tools/compile_liberties.py` refuses either half on its own: the exemption is
granted only where the entry and its position agree, and an entry sitting under **Resolved**
saying nothing about what settled it compiles as a standing liberty and names itself at the gate.

## Standing liberties

### L1 — No people, anywhere
**Decision:** version 1 ships with no human figures of any kind.
**Why:** the final removal of the Potawatomi from Chicago occurred in August 1835, inside the
target year. Depicting Native presence is not a research gap to be filled by inference; it
requires consultation (see `AGENTS.md`). Rather than depict some people and not others — which
would itself make a claim — the scene is uniformly unpopulated. An empty, accurate town is
honest; a populated, invented one is not.
**Consequence:** the town reads quieter than it was. Chicago in July 1835 held roughly 3,265
people and was booming. The absence is a deliberate statement of scope, not an estimate of
population.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09.

### L2 — Fauna presented at low density, and often as sound only
**Decision:** ambient wildlife is rendered sparsely, with many species present as audio, as traces,
or as nothing at all rather than as animated animals.
**Why:** two reasons, both evidential. July is the quietest wildlife date in the Chicago year — no
migration, silent leks, moulting waterfowl — and a summer scene populated with the spectacle of
*other* seasons would be wrong. And a boomtown of 3,265 people is not a wilderness; wild animal
density inside the platted grid was low.
**What the dataset now says (2026-08-11):** `data/fauna/` holds **139 species records across 10
habitat zones**. **Forty of them are present and would not be seen** — 25 audible only, 9 present
and imperceptible on this date, 6 as trace alone — and 15 more are recorded as absent or
deliberately withheld. Only **10 of 61 bird records are in full song** on 1 July, and each of those
carries a written argument for why that species is an exception; 42 are call-only or silent. Every
duck is flightless in wing moult. The prairie-chicken's lek is silent, the spring frog chorus is
over, and the passenger pigeon crosses in tens.
**Consequence:** the town reads quieter and emptier of animals than an eye would have found it, in
one direction only — sound carries where sight does not, and the loudest things in the July scene
are insects, frogs and livestock rather than birds. The validator enforces each of these as schema
(`tools/validate.py`, `check_fauna_species`), so this liberty is a description of the data and not
a hope about it.
**What the renderer actually does (2026-08-17, ROADMAP K51):** *nothing*, and the word "rendered"
in the decision above has been an overstatement for the life of this entry. No animal is drawn,
heard or traced in the walkthrough; there is no fauna geometry and no audio. K42 measured the
reason — no renderer source opened `data/fauna/` and `tools/publish.sh` did not copy it, so the
layer never left the repository. As of today it reaches a visitor as **text**: the Evidence
panel's *What was living here* section publishes all 139 records with their July status, presence
mode, abundance, behaviour, voice and sources. That is a card and not a population, and the
decision above stays the standing intent for whenever animals are drawn.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09. **Revised:** 2026-08-17.

### L3 — Vertical exaggeration available but off by default
**Decision:** the renderer may offer a vertical-exaggeration toggle; it defaults to off.
**Why:** total natural relief across the entire modeled area is under fifteen feet. Flatness is
the single most important fact about this landscape and the reason the city later had to raise
itself out of the mud. Exaggeration aids legibility and falsifies the experience, so it is opt-in
and clearly labeled.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09.

### L218 — Fifteen businesses stand on a street a directory printed after 1835
**Scope:** `address_back_projection.positions[placed]` — 15 businesses
**Decision:** where the 1835 record attests a trade and no source of the scene year says
where it stood, a **street** printed against that person in Fergus's Chicago directory of
1839 or 1843, or Norris's of 1844, may be read backwards and carried as the business's
street **face**. The placement is graded `reconstructed`, the note says how many years it
was carried, and the policy is `docs/ADDRESS-BACK-PROJECTION.md`.
**Why:** the town prints trades far more often than it prints doors. Twenty of 825
households carry a real `lives_at` and fifty a real `works_at`, while T-0632 left 87
later addresses sitting on the record with nothing reading them. The volumes that print
doors are all later than the scene, so the choice was a stated back-projection or no
position at all — the same choice L60 records for the estray pen, decided the same way:
an absent placement is invisible while a graded one is legible and correctable.
**Consequence:** Chicago roughly quadrupled between 1835 and 1844, re-platted its river
frontage and numbered its streets for the first time. Fifteen businesses therefore stand
on a face on the authority of a volume printed four to nine years after the scene, and
nine of those years are the widest gap in the set. Two are anchored on a crossing the
directory names and the rest have no point at all. A reader who thinks that is too far to
carry a shop is reading the `reconstructed` chip exactly as intended.
**What is NOT claimed, and this is the load-bearing half:** no lot, no roof, no door
count, and **no `lives_at` or `works_at`**. `docs/STREET-FACE-ADOPTION.md` limit 3 says
dealing a business to one roof on a face is an allocation and not a reading; stacking
that allocation on an address already read back would be two inventions under one chip.
The refusals and stand-offs are on the record beside the fifteen, so the arithmetic
is visible and not just the successes.
**Where it reaches a reader:** the Evidence panel's household card, as text. Nothing is
drawn — the same admission **L2** makes for the fauna layer, and made in the same words
rather than overstating "rendered".
**How to resolve:** a source inside the scene year that prints a door. The 1835 poll and
tax lists, T-0609's land-sales tracts and T-0611's Fort Dearborn Addition lot sales are
all closer to 1835 than a directory is, and any one of them that places one of these
businesses supersedes this entry under the policy's clause 2 without an argument.
**Recorded:** 2026-09-04 (T-0633).
**Restated:** 2026-09-04 (T-0514), from fifteen to fourteen, and the reason is a loss rather
than a repair. T-0514 seated 531 new people, and the directory crosswalk that feeds this pass
binds a later entry to a resident only where the surname reaches one person. A bigger town made
`Fullerton` reach two, so Alexander N. Fullerton's 1839 entry went ambiguous, his card no longer
carries the later address this pass reads, and his North Water Street face is withdrawn — the
one street in the town no other rule can seat a shop on, which is what makes the withdrawal
worth naming rather than absorbing. The pass now adjudicates 141 addresses against 87, because
the same larger town let the directory spend reach more people; 105 of the new refusals are
clause 1, a person the 1835 papers give no trade for. Nothing was regraded and no placement was
invented to hold the count at fifteen. **T-0670** carries the surname-uniqueness weakness that
caused it.
**Restated:** 2026-09-05 (T-0839), from fourteen back to fifteen, and this time the reason is
the repair. The 2026-09-04 withdrawal above is the clearest single measurement of what
duplicate cards cost this town: `Fullerton` reached two people, so Alexander N. Fullerton's
1839 entry went ambiguous and his North Water Street face — the one street in the town no
other rule can seat a shop on — was withdrawn. The two were never two men. T-0839 folded
`A. N. Fullerton`, `Alex N Fullerton` and `Alexander M Fullerton` onto him under the owner's
own ruling, the surname reaches one person again, and the face comes back on the same
authority it was withdrawn under. Nothing was regraded and no placement was invented; the
crosswalk's own uniqueness test simply stopped being confused by a man the town held four
times. T-0670's weakness is unchanged and still open — this repaired one instance of it.

## Resolved

Entries here were true when they were written and are kept verbatim, with a **Resolved:**
line saying what settled them. The gate exempts this section from the check that a claimed
value is still an invention, which is what lets an append-only document survive its own data
being corrected.

**This section sits ABOVE the per-subject register on purpose**, and the reason is the exemption
in the sentence before this one. While it was the last section in the file, every liberty
appended at the end of the file — the operation this document tells you to perform — landed in
it and was exempted from a check it should have been subject to (T-0054). The `**Resolved:**`
line is now load-bearing rather than a courtesy: an entry here without one is a standing liberty
that has been misfiled, and `tools/compile_liberties.py` says so and compiles it as standing.


### L46 — The fort stands on a bank the model has no cut or fill for
**Decision:** the **stockade** and the **commandant's quarters** stand clear of the terrain on
their north sides — 1.40 m and 0.46 m at the worst point — and are declared
`approach_not_modelled`. No cut, fill, revetment, platform or foundation is modelled anywhere in
the complex.
**Why:** the fort sits on a plateau at about 3.33 m that falls away to the river between local
N +245 and N +270, which is what a fort on a river bank inside a bend should do. The north wall
of the stockade and the north face of the brick range cross the top of that fall, and the
archetypes build a level base at one elevation. The real work plainly had something under it —
a picket line is set in a trench and a brick range needs footings — and no source reached
describes either.
**Consequence:** walk round to the river side of the fort and the pickets stand up out of the
slope on nothing. It is the honest picture of two things at once: a fort correctly placed on a
bank, and a model with no earthworks in it.
**How to resolve:** a levelled section of the bank, which no source gives; or terrain work that
models the platform the fort stood on, which is a terrain parcel rather than a structure one.
**Covers:** `fort_dearborn_palisade.picket_1816.ground_contact`, `fort_dearborn_commandants_quarters.brick_1816.ground_contact`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.
**Revised:** 2026-08-11, hours after it was written, and the revision is the good kind. This
entry was originally titled *"The fort stands 832 m beyond the modelled ground, and nothing
could see it"* and covered the **ground contact of all fourteen** structures in this complex,
because the `e1834_harbor_cut` heightfield stopped at local E +320 and the fort is at E +1152.
**S2e parcel (b) landed while this parcel was being written** — the field now reaches E +1700 —
so twelve of the fourteen simply land, their declarations are gone from the records, and the two
that remain fail for a completely different and much more interesting reason, which is what the
entry above now describes. Two of the twelve had to move to get there: the **lighthouse** and
the **root house**, whose positions were always `conjectural`, had been put where no ground
existed to contradict them and turned out to be standing in the channel; both moved onto the
bank top and both notes say so.
**The half of the original entry that is NOT superseded, because it is about the machinery and
not about the ground.** `tools/heightfield.py` clamps outside the box, so while the fort was 832
m past the edge it sampled the clamped edge for its base AND for every point of its outline, the
two agreed to the millimetre, and the ground-contact gate — the gate this project wrote
specifically to catch a building standing on nothing — reported a **perfect landing**. Every
structure L40 covers was caught only because the clamped edge varies along a wall and produced a
gap; the fort was far enough out and square enough on to produce none. The gate could see
buildings that were nearly right and was blind to the one that was completely wrong.
`Heightfield.covers()`, the `outside_modelled_ground` state and the two-way check that a
declaration matches the measurement were written for that and stay whether or not any structure
currently needs them — and turning them on immediately flagged two structures in other parcels
that nothing had caught. See `docs/STATUS.md` § "Known weaknesses" 0a.
**Resolved:** 2026-08-21, by exactly the terrain work this entry asked for. T-0125 narrowed the bank face across the fort's river frontage from 20 m to 8 m (L155), on the owner's ruling that the ground should give rather than the bake or the placement; the ground under the stockade's north wall rose from 1.26 m to 2.57 m and both structures now LAND on the terrain, within the gate's 0.35 m. The `approach_not_modelled` declarations are dropped from both records in the same commit. Note what did and did not happen: the fall to the river is still there and is still uncut — no revetment, platform or footing is modelled anywhere in the complex, and a picket line is still set in no trench. What changed is that the fort's own ground now reaches its walls, so the pickets no longer stand up out of the slope on nothing.

### L30 — The bridge lands on nothing, and no approach is modelled
**Decision:** the North Branch bridge's deck stops at the traced 1834 waterline at both ends,
2.42 m above the ground beneath it, and **no approach of any kind is built** — no embankment, no
ramp, no sloping run of deck. The crossing stands in the river and touches neither bank.
**Why:** the deck sits 2.22 m above the water (Cleaver's inferred six-foot clearance plus the
stringer and plank depth under it), and the modelled ground at both landings is Z = 0 by
construction, because the terrain surface crosses the datum exactly along the drawn waterline.
The highest land anywhere in the 640 m box is 1.31 m. So there is nothing for the deck to arrive
at, and nothing anybody wrote says what did. Andreas gives the stringers; Cleaver gives the
width and log abutments "in the shallow water near the banks"; no source reached describes how a
person or a team got from the bank up onto the deck. Building one would stack a second invention
on top of the clearance figure — which is itself only `inferred`, and unsourced in the dossier
that supplied it — and unlike the fifteen cribs of L29, it is the invention a visitor would walk
over rather than look at.
**Consequence:** the crossing reads as a bridge to nowhere. From the bank you cannot step onto
it, and the walkthrough cannot pretend otherwise: the walker follows the terrain, so the deck is
scenery you pass under. That is honest about the evidence and wrong about the town — a bridge
that carried a procession of hundreds in August 1835 plainly met its banks. Every part of that
gap is unrecorded, so it is stated rather than drawn.
**How to resolve:** a period depiction of the crossing or a levelled section. The 1834/1835
Wabansia and Kinzie's Addition plat, contemporaneous to within two weeks of the scene date, is
the best candidate; a sourced clearance figure would also narrow it, since a lower deck needs
less approach and the six feet is the weakest number in the record.
**Covers:** `north_branch_bridge.log_1832.ground_contact`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.
**Evidence since:** both candidates named above were pulled on 2026-08-10 and **the gap is
unchanged, but two of the escape routes out of it are closed.** The Wabansia and Kinzie's
Addition plat is the sheet this project already holds as `hathaway_1834`; inspected at the
crossing's own georeferenced pixel it draws no bridge, and neither does Wright 1834 — both stop
their street lines at the waterline, because a platted street is a dedication and not a
structure. And the six feet is no longer "the weakest number in the record": Caton, Bates,
Cleaver and Noble state it in 1883, and state why — the bridges "were about six feet above the
water, so that teams passed under them on the ice freely" — so a lower deck is not available as
the cheap way to shorten an approach nobody described. The same sentence calls these **wagon**
bridges, which means a wagon reached the deck somehow. The approach is therefore better attested
as a fact and no better described than it was. See `docs/RESEARCH/north_branch_bridge.md` §6.
**Revised:** 2026-08-10.
**Resolved:** 2026-08-19. T-0046 built the approaches. Terrain earthworks (`approaches` in
`terrain_spec.json`, every entry graded `reconstructed`) now raise Kinzie Street to the deck at
1 in 12 at both ends; the ground-contact gate measures both end edges within its 0.35 m
tolerance of the deck, and the declaration is off the record. The invention this entry refused
to make is made and declared instead — L147 is its record. What changed the reasoning is the
owner's standing instruction (AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER): the 1883 statement this
entry already quotes makes these WAGON bridges, so an approach is a necessity of the evidence,
and a declared reconstruction is honest where a bridge to nowhere is wrong about the town.


### L38 — The South Branch bridge lands on ground that is not there
**Decision:** `south_branch_raft_bridge` does not reach the terrain at either end.
**Why:** the same admission L30 already makes for the North Branch bridge, for the same reason
and with the same cause. The bridge is placed and dimensioned from the traced 1834 waterlines,
which is real evidence about where the water was; the ground it should land on is the terrain
heightfield, which is modelled from a zone table and does not carry a graded approach. Neither
is wrong on its own, and the model still shows a bridge arriving nowhere.
**Consequence:** a visitor who walks to either end steps off the deck. Because both branch
bridges now do this, it reads as a characteristic of the model rather than a defect in one
record, which is if anything worse — it makes the crossing look deliberate.
**How to resolve:** approach embankments, which are terrain work rather than structure work,
and which nothing in the sources describes for either bridge.
**Covers:** `south_branch_raft_bridge.log_1833.ground_contact`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.
**Resolved:** 2026-08-19. The same resolution as L30, in the same pass: T-0046's approach
earthworks (L147) raise the ground to this deck at both ends and the declaration is off the
record.


### L69 — Two structures stand at their documented sites beyond the modelled ground
**Decision:** `brickyard_north_side` and `slough_log_bridge` are placed at the sites their sources
give — the north bank between Clark and Dearborn, and the Water Street crossing at the foot of State
Street — which lie 300 m and 490 m east of the modelled terrain box. Both phases declare
`ground_contact: {state: "outside_modelled_ground"}`.
**Why:** the opposite choice was available and was taken for the Clybourne records (L64), which were
pulled to the modelled edge because their sites are kilometres away and only loosely fixed. These two
are different: the brickyard's site is attested to a 120 m span of street frontage (Andreas scan
p. 1161) and the bridge's to the meeting of a named street and a named stream mouth, so displacing
them would throw away the best evidence either record holds. What is missing here is terrain, not
evidence.
**Consequence:** neither structure meets any ground. `tools/heightfield.py` clamps at the box edge, so
without the declaration the gate would have reported both as landing perfectly on terrain that does
not exist. The slough bridge is worse off again: the South Division slough it crosses is not cut into
this terrain epoch at all — the only modelled watercourse besides the river is an unnamed slough on
the north side — so it stands over flat ground with no stream beneath it, and the `bridge_timber`
archetype anchors it to the river's water surface, which the hydrology dossier puts 0.15–0.45 m below
the slough's own.
**How to resolve:** extend the terrain epoch east over the South Division and the north bank as far as
Dearborn, and cut the slough's documented route into it. Then both declarations come off and this
entry moves to Resolved.
**Covers:** `slough_log_bridge.log_1833.ground_contact`.
**Evidence since, 2026-08-11:** the brickyard's token is withdrawn — S2e extended the
heightfield east and Blodgett's yard now lands on modelled ground. The slough crossing still
stands clear of it, but for the different reason recorded on that record: the South Division
slough it crosses is still not cut into this terrain epoch, so it spans nothing.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.
**Resolved:** 2026-08-19. In two halves, two runs apart. The brickyard's half was already
withdrawn above (S2e, 2026-08-11). The slough crossing's half closed when T-0046 graded its
banks down to the deck at both ends (a cut — L147), so the `outside_modelled_ground` /
`approach_not_modelled` declarations are off the record and the crossing can be walked. What
this entry's last sentence asked for — the South Division slough cut into the terrain epoch, so
the bridge spans water rather than solid ground — is still not done, and is re-filed as ticket
T-0109 rather than left implied here.
**Evidence since, 2026-08-24:** **the last sentence above is answered and this entry is closed
out for good.** T-0005 carved dossier zone 14 — the South Division's drain — into
`e1834_harbor_cut` on 2026-08-20, and T-0118 straightened its last reach to run square beneath
this deck the same day. Neither was aimed at this entry or at T-0109; both are why it can be
retired. Measured on the committed heightfield by `tools/measure_slough_crossing.py`: **3.30 m
of open water in the deck's 8.00 m span** (41 %), **0.53 m deep**, **2.35 m of dry abutment seat
at each end**, and the channel unbroken from the planks to the river. The one clause above that
did NOT come true is the diagnosis about levels — this entry expected the archetype to anchor
the deck to a river surface 0.15–0.45 m below the slough's own, and the drain as built backs up
into the river as one pool at one surface, so the offset never arose. What is still invented is
what it always was: the depth and the width of a watercourse whose route is documented and whose
section nobody recorded. That invention lives in **L149** with the swales, not here.


### L40 — Two thirds of the town stands on ground that has not been built
**Decision:** twenty of the thirty-three structures now in the dataset stand **outside the
modelled heightfield** and do not reach the terrain beneath them. Their records are correct and
their positions are derived through the same fitted transform as everything else; there is
simply no ground there yet.
**Why:** the heightfield covers **E −320 … +320, N −320 … +320** — a 640 m square around the
forks, built when the forks was the whole scene. The town is not that shape. South Water Street
runs from about **E +347** (`h_jones_store`) to **E +745** (`frederick_thomas_shop`); the
Dearborn Street bridge is at **+699**; Cobweb Castle, the north-bank agency house, is at
**+814**; the Beaubien homestead is at **+1090**. The entire business district — the reason the
town existed — sits east of the modelled world, along with the bridge that crossed to it.
This was not discovered by inspection. It surfaced the moment the project stopped building only
the best-evidenced structures and started building the town: the forks quadrant was sufficient
for eight buildings and is nowhere near sufficient for thirty-three.
**Consequence:** those twenty buildings currently float. A visitor who walks east finds the
ground end and the town continue. **This is worse than the buildings being absent**, because an
absent building makes no claim while a floating one makes a false one, and the confidence view
cannot mark it — the tint grades what a building WAS, not whether it stands anywhere. It is
recorded here as a liberty rather than left as a bug because it is a known, measured, deliberate
intermediate state: the records were built first on the argument that evidence is harder to come
by than geometry, and the geometry is now the thing holding.
**How to resolve:** ROADMAP § S2e — extend the heightfield east to about **E +1700**, a
~2.0 km × 0.7 km field, using the shore, the 1834 cut, the sand bar and the old southward
channel already traced in `data/traces/vectors/wright_1834_east.json` and
`shoreline.geojson`. That work is in progress. **When it lands, this entry moves to Resolved**
rather than being edited, and any structure still floating afterwards — the North Branch
industry sits well north of even the extended box — gets an entry of its own naming it.
**Covers:** `bates_auction_room.frame_1834.ground_contact`, `carpenter_south_water_store.frame_1833.ground_contact`, `chicago_american_office.frame_1835.ground_contact`, `chicago_democrat_office.frame_1833.ground_contact`, `dole_warehouse_south.frame_1832.ground_contact`, `frederick_thomas_shop.frame_1835.ground_contact`, `h_jones_store.frame_1833.ground_contact`, `harmon_loomis_store.frame_1833.ground_contact`, `jb_beaubien_homestead.factory_1817.ground_contact`, `madore_beaubien_house.log_1831.ground_contact`, `old_bank_building.frame_1834.ground_contact`, `peck_store.frame_1833.ground_contact`, `pruyne_kimball_drugstore.frame_1830s.ground_contact`, `h_jones_store.frame_1833.footprint`, `h_jones_store.frame_1833.position`, `h_jones_store.frame_1833.form.stories`, `jh_kinzie_forwarding_store.frame_1830s.footprint`, `jh_kinzie_forwarding_store.frame_1830s.position`, `jh_kinzie_forwarding_store.frame_1830s.form.stories`, `north_pier.crib_1835.ground_contact`, `south_pier.crib_1835.ground_contact`, `cobweb_castle.log_1820.ground_contact`, `blacksmith_shop_state_st.log_1823.ground_contact`, `north_side_school_1833.log_1833.ground_contact`, `steamboat_hotel.frame_1835.ground_contact`, `council_house.log_1834.ground_contact`, `first_presbyterian_church.frame_1834.ground_contact`, `st_marys_church.frame_1833.ground_contact`, `log_jail.log_1833.ground_contact`, `estray_pen.pen_1833.ground_contact`, `cook_county_courthouse_1835.wood_1835.ground_contact`, `chappel_infant_school.log_1833.ground_contact`, `watkins_school_house.house_1833.ground_contact`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

**Resolved:** 2026-08-11. The ground was built. ROADMAP § S2e extended the heightfield east from a
640 m square to **E −320 … +1700, N −400 … +400** — 809 × 321 samples at 2.5 m — and twenty-seven of
the structures this entry covers now land on real terrain. The declarations came off those records in
the same pass that moved this entry here.

Three things are worth keeping from it rather than deleting with it. **The finding was only visible
because the town got built**: eight well-evidenced buildings at the forks all sat comfortably inside
the old box, and it took building the business district to discover the business district had no
ground under it. **The gate could not see it either** — `tools/heightfield.py` clamped outside the
box, so a structure 832 m past the edge sampled the clamped edge for its base and for every contact
point, agreed to the millimetre, and was reported as landing perfectly. Fort Dearborn is what exposed
that, and the fix (`Heightfield.covers()`, plus a two-way check that a declaration matches the
measurement) immediately flagged two more structures nothing had caught. And **not everything came
back**: the Clybourne records still stand about three kilometres from their attested ground up the
North Branch, and the stockade's north wall and the commandant's quarters now cross the top of the
river bank because no cut, fill, revetment or foundation is modelled anywhere in this project. Those
are L64 and L46's business, not this entry's.

### L13 — Composite log-and-frame buildings are extruded to a single wall height
**Decision:** `miller_house` and `wolf_point_tavern` are each modelled at one wall height,
although both are attested as composites — Miller's as a two-storey frame range fronting the
river with a one-storey log cabin behind, the Wolf Point Tavern as "partly log and partly frame".
**Why:** the `log_dwelling` archetype does not yet build a mixed-height mass, and averaging the
two heights would produce a building matching neither description. The records carry the taller
element's height and flag the overstatement rather than hiding it.
**Consequence:** a geometry requirement for `log_dwelling`, discovered from the evidence in the
same way the Sauganash's attached log wing was (L4a). Until it lands, the log elements render
taller than they were.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09.
**Revised:** 2026-08-10 — half of this is no longer true. The archetype does build a mixed-height
mass: a frame addition carries its own storey count and its own height, and the Wolf Point Tavern
now stands as a 2.6 m log core with a 2.55 m frame bay rather than one extrusion. Miller's house
is unchanged and still the case this entry describes — its record carries the taller element's
5.2 m and its log cabin is rendered two storeys high — because setting its frame range's height
without also settling how much of the footprint the range takes would swap one overstatement for
a different one. The entry stays here rather than moving to Resolved for exactly that reason.
**Resolved:** 2026-08-10 — the other half landed the same day, in the slice the Revised line
above asks for. Miller's range now carries its own width (9 m), depth (6 m), storey count (2,
`documented`) and height (5.2 m), so the 5.2 m came off `wall_height_m` and the log cabin stands
at the 2.6 m this record has named for it since it was written. Neither building is a single
extrusion any more, and the overstatement this entry existed to flag is gone rather than
described. Worth keeping the sentence "the records carry the taller element's height": for
Miller's house that had a sharper edge than it reads. `stories` was `2, documented`, and the
archetype reads `stories` as the LOG CORE's — so the documented claim was spent on the cabin,
the range fell back to a default height of 4.7 m, and the model stood the taller element behind
the shorter one. The invented dimensions that replaced the defaults are admitted in L27.

### L20 — Wolf Point Tavern: the frame half and the painted wolf sign are recorded and unbuilt
**Decision:** the record states `frame_extension: true` and `signage: painted_wolf_sign`, both
`documented`, and the mesh contains neither. What stands at Wolf Point is a plain hewn-log cabin
with no frame piece and no sign.
**Why:** not a judgement — an accident, and it is recorded as one rather than dressed up. The
`log_dwelling` archetype reads `frame_addition` and `sign`; this record spells the same two
things `frame_extension` and `signage`. Neither spelling is wrong and neither resolver ever
complained, because `from_phase` fills an absent attribute with a default: no frame addition, no
sign. The building was baked from those defaults and nothing anywhere said the two best-attested
features of the house had been dropped.
**Consequence:** this is the worst case the confidence model has, because the model is working
exactly as designed and still misleads. `documented` is the strongest claim the project makes.
A visitor who picks the tavern reads *signage · painted wolf sign · documented* on a building
with no sign on it, and *construction · partly log and partly frame* on a building that is
entirely log — and the one thing every source agrees the Wolf Point tavern was known by is the
painted wolf hung outside it. The chips were true about the evidence and false about the view.
**How to resolve:** rename the two attributes to the parameters the archetype reads and re-bake.
That is a data change plus geometry, and the two have to land in one slice, so it is queued in
`docs/ROADMAP.md` rather than half-done here. Until it lands the record admits the gap.
**Covers:** `wolf_point_tavern.log_frame_1828.form.frame_extension`, `wolf_point_tavern.log_frame_1828.form.signage`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.
**Resolved:** 2026-08-10 — the two attributes are spelled `frame_addition` and `sign`, the
names the archetype reads, and the tavern was re-baked in the same slice: a frame bay stands
at the north end of the log core and a board hangs from a bracket on the river front. The
record now carries the frame part's side, width, depth and storey count explicitly rather
than inheriting the archetype's defaults, and every invented one of those is admitted in
L24; what the board shows is admitted in L25. This entry stays exactly as written, including
the two spellings that no longer resolve, because a silently corrected admission is not one.


### L21 — Chimneys are counted in the records and fixed in the archetypes
**Decision:** every record states a chimney count and no archetype reads it. `frame_tavern`
builds two stacks at 0.22 and 0.78 of the frontage; `log_dwelling` builds one, at the gable end.
The records that say two get two only where the archetype already built two.
**Why:** the counts were written from the depictions ("both depictions show two") and the
archetypes were written from the same depictions, so they have never disagreed — which is
precisely why nothing caught that they were never connected. Samuel Miller's house is the case
that shows it: the record says two chimneys and the `log_dwelling` archetype builds one.
**Consequence:** a record could raise a chimney count on new evidence and the town would not
change. For Miller's house the model already shows one stack fewer than the record claims.
**How to resolve:** make the count a parameter in both archetypes and re-bake — a small change
on the data side, a geometry change on the other, so it lands as one slice.
**Covers:** `green_tree_tavern.form.chimneys`, `miller_house.form.chimneys`, `sauganash_hotel.form.chimneys`, `walker_meeting_house.form.chimneys`, `western_hotel.form.chimneys`, `wolf_point_tavern.form.chimneys`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.
**Resolved:** 2026-08-10 — `chimneys` is a parameter of both archetypes and the number built is
the number recorded. Miller's house has its second stack, on the frame range, which is where the
record's own reasoning for counting two puts it. The `log_dwelling` half was not a missing
feature but a third misspelling of the kind L20 records: the parameter was `chimney`, a boolean,
and no record has ever contained that word — so `from_phase` took its default and built one stack
on every log building whatever the record said. That class of defect is now a test rather than a
discovery (`test_consumed_attributes_actually_reach_the_parameters`): an attribute an archetype
declares it consumes has to change the resolved parameters when its value changes. What this
entry admitted is discharged; what it did not admit — that a stack's position, size and material
are invented on every building — is now stated on its own, in L26.

### L29 — The North Branch bridge stands on fifteen piers nobody recorded
**Decision:** the bridge is built with cribs every 4.5 m, which over its 71.83 m span puts
**fifteen log cribs standing in the river** between the two abutments. The spacing is tagged
`conjectural` on the record.
**Why:** what survives about this bridge is its width, its material and its ends. Cleaver:
"The abutments were built of heavy logs in the shallow water near the banks. These bridges were
ten feet wide." Andreas: "formed of stringers." Nothing anybody wrote describes the middle of it.
Something had to hold up 71.83 m of log stringer, so intermediate supports are not the invention
— their number, their spacing and their form are. 4.5 m is the archetype's own default, kept
deliberately rather than replaced with a fresh guess, because a new number would look like a
finding and would not be one.
**Consequence:** this is the most conspicuous invention in the structure and it is invisible in
the confidence view, because the tint on the piers grades what a crib IS rather than how many of
them there were. A visitor walking the bank sees a regular colonnade marching across the water
and reads it as a fact about the bridge. It is a fact about the archetype. The span it divides is
itself the drawn waterline-to-waterline distance, and Cleaver's abutments stood *inside* that
line by an unrecorded amount, so the true bay count was smaller than fifteen by an unknown
margin.
**How to resolve:** a period depiction or a survey of the crossing. Two are worth trying: the
1834/1835 Wabansia and Kinzie's Addition plat, which is contemporaneous to within two weeks of
the scene date, and Andreas vol. 1 at page-image level, where the bridge prose transcribed here
sits.
**Covers:** `north_branch_bridge.log_1832.form.pier_spacing_m`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.
**Evidence since:** the sentence above — "nothing anybody wrote describes the middle of it" — is
no longer true, and the entry stays here rather than moving to Resolved because the model still
shows fifteen cribs. Somebody did write it down: at the foot of Andreas pp. 631-632 is a
statement signed by J. D. Caton, John Bates, Charles Cleaver and John Noble, agreed at a meeting
of old settlers in the fall of 1883, saying that both branch bridges "were built on abutments and
two 'bents'", each bent "of four heavy logs, resting on the bottom, in deeper water". **Two
intermediate supports, not fifteen**, and bents rather than cribs. It was found by reading the
printed pages either side of the passage this project already quoted, rather than by searching
the index, which does not reach it. Until the record and its re-bake land together the river
still carries a colonnade that the evidence does not, and this admission stands exactly as
written. Source: `old_settlers_bridges_1883`; the finding is
`docs/RESEARCH/north_branch_bridge.md` §6 and the work order is `docs/STATUS.md` §23.
**Revised:** 2026-08-10.
**Resolved:** 2026-08-10 — the mesh shows two bents, so this entry moves here, and not before,
which is what the Revised line above said it was waiting for. `pier_spacing_m` is gone from the
record and from the archetype: `pier_count: 2, documented` replaces it, `pier_kind` is `bent`,
and `bridge_timber` builds four heavy logs under a cap at each of them. The parameter changed
rather than the number, because a spacing is a builder's convenience nobody would remember and a
count is what a user of a bridge does. **What this entry admitted is discharged and what it did
not is now L31**: the letter gives two bents and never says where along the span they stood, so
the positions are still the archetype's, and the tint still cannot say so. The sentence in
**Consequence** about the true bay count being "smaller than fifteen by an unknown margin" turned
out to be true in the wrong direction and by a factor of five.

### L116 — The American sycamore is drawn as an American elm from the bark outwards

**Decision:** the sycamore now planted in the gallery (ROADMAP **K45(b1)**) is drawn with
**`ulmus_americana`'s draw archetype** — its bole fraction, its taper, its trunk diameter band,
its puff count and **its bark colour**. Its height, its crown width, its July foliage colour and
its confidence come from its own record, as they do for every species. It is the only placed
species in the scene without an archetype of its own, and `tools/measure_planting_reach.py` banks
that fact by name, exactly, in both directions.

**What a visitor is therefore not seeing.** The one thing `data/flora/zones/z05_riverbank_timber`
singles the species out for is its bark: *"Rare, at its northern edge; **white mottled bark
flashing on the upper limbs**."* That sentence is the reason a sycamore is identifiable at 200 m
in a floodplain wood, and this scene draws the tree with the elm's dark brown trunk. A visitor
looking for a sycamore cannot find one by looking.

**Why it was not invented instead.** `SPECIES` carries a bark colour as an sRGB constant per
species and **no record in `data/flora/` carries a bark colour at all** — the dossiers behind
these records are a presettlement land survey and a regional vegetation reconstruction, and
neither states a colour. Choosing a hex for "white mottled" is a straightforward invention, and it
is a *conspicuous* one: it would be the palest trunk in the scene and the first thing a visitor
noticed about that stretch of river. Inventing it inside a parcel whose subject is one mix entry
would put a highly visible guess into the frame on the authority of nobody. The substitution is
recorded here instead, where it can be read.

**Consequence, stated so a reader can weigh it.** The tree's *presence* is evidenced — the record
places it on this riverbank at 1–3 per hectare — and its size and foliage are the record's. Only
its trunk is another species'. That is an omission plus a substitution, not an overstatement: no
attribute is graded higher than its evidence and nothing in `data/` moved.

**How to resolve:** a `SPECIES.platanus_occidentalis` archetype, whose bark colour is either
sourced or recorded here as invented in its own right; the mottling itself would need a second
material or a vertex-colour break, which is **R-W2b/R-W2c** territory — the town's chimneys are
in the same queue for the same reason. When it lands, the entry has to leave
`drawn_as_another_species` with `--update` in the same commit.

Related: **L114**, which recorded the omission this half-resolves, and **L115**, the other
drawing convention in the same layer.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-16.
**Resolved:** 2026-08-16 (ROADMAP **K47**) — `SPECIES.platanus_occidentalis` exists, so the
species is drawn with its own bole, taper, diameter band, puff count and bark, and
`drawn_as_another_species` is empty where it held this one substitution. The **How to resolve**
line above offered a choice — sourced, or recorded as invented — and there was never a source to
find: no record in `data/flora/` carries a bark colour, so the colours are invented within stated
bounds and are **L118**. What this entry admitted is discharged, and the half it did not — the
*mottling*, as against the pale-versus-dark break — is carried forward in L118 rather than closed
here.

### L60 — The estray pen is a fence, and the model gives it a roof
**Decision:** Chicago's first public building — the estray pen on the south-west corner of the
public square — is built with the `outbuilding` archetype as a log-walled box 30 × 20 ft and
8 ft high, with a gate and **a shed roof at the shallowest pitch the generator will accept**.
Every one of those values is tagged `conjectural`.
**Why:** what the sources attest is a municipal FUNCTION, a corner and a month. A pound is an
enclosure; there is no reason to think this one was roofed and nothing mentions a roof. This
project has no generator that builds an enclosure — `palisade` is named in the schema and has no
module behind it — and `outbuilding`, the only archetype that will build a low walled rectangle,
cannot build a roofless structure. So the choice was a roofed box or no building at all, and the
working policy for this parcel is that an absent building is invisible while a conjectural one is
legible and correctable.
**Consequence:** the roof is the model's, not the record's, and it is the most conspicuous thing
about the structure. It is set to `shed` at 6 degrees — a 0.64 m rise over the pen's 6 m run, as
close to flat as the generator goes — which is a deliberate attempt to minimise a feature that
probably was not there rather than a finding about a roof that was. The material is invented too,
and the live alternative would look completely different: most frontier pounds were split-rail or
post-and-rail, which is open and horizontal and see-through, where this is a closed notched log
wall. The gate is a doorway in a wall where the real thing was probably a hung rail gate. What
survives of the evidence in the mesh is a rectangle of about the right size in about the right
place.
**How to resolve:** an enclosure archetype — post-and-rail or notched log, ROOFLESS, gated,
taking a perimeter rather than a footprint. It would serve this record, the fenced-or-unfenced
state of the public square itself, the garrison gardens and every yard in the town, and it is
the honest fix. A town or county order establishing the pound would settle the size and the
material at the same time.
**Covers:** `estray_pen.pen_1833.footprint`, `estray_pen.pen_1833.form.construction`, `estray_pen.pen_1833.form.roof_type`, `estray_pen.pen_1833.form.roof_pitch_deg`, `estray_pen.pen_1833.form.wall_height_m`, `estray_pen.pen_1833.form.door`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

**Resolved:** 2026-08-18 (T-0051). The enclosure layer arrived and the pen was the second record on it.
`data/enclosures/estray_pen.json` walks the same 30 × 20 ft rectangle, on the same corner, as a **roofless
post-and-rail perimeter with a gateway**, drawn by `renderers/web/js/enclosures.js` at load and needing no
bake. The five invented values this entry claimed — `construction`, `roof_type`, `roof_pitch_deg`,
`wall_height_m` and `door` — are **retired from the record rather than re-graded**, the GLB and its manifest
entry are deleted, and the phase carries a `drawn_by` block that `tools/validate.py` holds to all of that.
Andreas is now quoted for the thing he actually says: *"the 'pen' was a small wooden enclosure and quite
roofless"*. What this entry still covers, and what keeps it worth reading, is the **footprint** — the
rectangle, its size and its corner-of-a-block placement are as invented as they ever were, and the fence
that now stands on them is invented in its own right and claimed at **L128**. The generator half of the fix
this entry asked for is still open: `palisade` still has no enclosure form behind it, so a future scene that
wants the pen baked with the rest of the town still needs one.


### L94 — Two of ten roofs given an occupant, and the rule that left the other eight anonymous

**Decision:** of the ten anonymous roofs `blk_randolph_wells` put on the plat, **two are adopted
by the inferred-household layer** — the D1 log cabin becomes the dwelling of a thirteenth
labouring household and the D3 one-room frame cottage the dwelling of an eleventh carpenter's —
and **eight stay anonymous count-units**. Nothing is built, moved or regraded by the adoption. The
roofs' presence, position and footprint were invented before it and are invented after it; what
the two gain is an argued occupant instead of a blank, and what the town gains is two households
it did not have.

**The rule is the point of this entry, because the temptation it refuses is structural.** A block
parcel can put ten dwellings on the plat in the time it takes to append a recipe entry, and the
occupation census cannot move at that speed without becoming a function of what has been drawn.
The town's trade mix is a claim about the town — 3,265 people in 398 dwellings, calibrated against
Andreas's 1833 roster — and a census that grows every time somebody draws a cottage is fitting the
evidence to the model. So a block roof may be adopted only where **both** of two independent tests
pass, and the rule is now written into the programme's `method` list where the next parcel will
read it:

1. the trade's own committed argument states, in its own text, that its count is a **floor rather
   than a bound**; and
2. the roof's family is one this layer **already houses that trade in**.

Exactly two of the twenty-nine trades in the census pass the first test: the carpenter (*"the shop
count is a floor under the trade, not a measure of it"*) and the labourer (*"still a small fraction
of what 3,265 people implies"*). Every other entry either states a ceiling — the plasterer's and
the drover's say *"and no more"* outright — or is bounded by a workshop or store family's roof
target under the programme's own method rule 2. And the two trades that pass the first test are
housed by this layer in exactly the two families this block deals them: **all eight** of the
layer's adopted labouring households live in a D1, and **nine of ten** carpenters in a D3. The
tests were derived independently and agreed on the first block they were applied to, which is the
only reason to trust either of them.

**What that leaves unoccupied, and why each refusal is a different kind.** The three yard
buildings — a stable, a privy, a woodshed — have no occupant to argue about: a yard building
serves the lot it stands behind, and a household living in a privy is not a modest claim but a
nonsensical one. The generator now refuses an ancillary adoption by name. The D2 plank shanty, the
D4 two-room and the D5 deep-plan cottages are refused by the rule above: this layer houses
laundresses, boatmen, masons, clerks and shoemakers in those families, and every one of those
trades is bounded by a count somebody argued to a number. **The H1 and H2 houses are refused for
the strongest reason of the three.** They are the town's larger house and its merchant or
professional house, of which the schedule allows 18 and 14 in the whole town; the people who lived
in the best fourteen houses in Chicago are the most likely of anyone here to be nameable, and
inventing an anonymous merchant into one of them would break the programme's own rule never to
infer a person where a documented one is available. Those two want the treatment the civic roofs
are getting under T-I3 — a reading of the record, not a household drawn from a census.

**Consequence:** 85 anonymous roofs now carry an argued occupant rather than 83, and the town
holds 154 households and 190 persons — 94 of them reconstructed, none of them a figure anybody
will see, because no human is drawn (L1). Standing roofs are unchanged at 251: this parcel added
no building. A visitor clicking either of the two adopted roofs is told who the layer supposes
lived there, that the supposition is a hypothesis and not a person, and that the roof itself is
still an invention.

**How to resolve:** the same evidence the block itself wants — parcel-level tax, deed or
assessment records naming who held and occupied these lots in July 1835. A named occupant replaces
an inferred one; it never adds a household to the census.

**Covers:** `recon_1835_blk_randolph_wells_d1_06.occupants`,
`recon_1835_blk_randolph_wells_d3_05.occupants`
**Recorded:** 2026-08-14.
**Resolved:** 2026-09-02, by the owner's ruling that retired the reconstructed resident population — "remove any pre-existing reconstructed people from the resident list and household" — and, asked whether the roofs they occupied should be abandoned or kept, "Keep as anonymous stock." The adoption this entry records was WITHDRAWN rather than corrected: the households that made it no longer exist, so the two roofs went back to being the anonymous count-units the other eight always were, and the `occupants` block this entry covers is gone from both records. Nothing was built, moved or regraded on the way out either — the roofs stand exactly where this entry put them, unassigned until the placement sweep the same ruling asks for. T-0516 carried the withdrawal to the records (2026-09-05); the argument that raised the households is kept as history in `data/reconstruction/1835_inferred_household_programme.json`.


### L109 — Two more roofs given an occupant, and the discovery that the roofs refused beside them were never candidates in the first place

**Decision:** two of the nine anonymous roofs `blk_randolph_dearborn` put on the plat are **adopted
by the inferred-household layer** — the D3 one-room frame cottage on lot 0 becomes the dwelling of a
twentieth carpenter's household and the D1 log cabin on lot 3 the dwelling of a twenty-third
labouring one — and the other seven stay anonymous count-units. **Nothing is built, moved or
regraded.** The roofs' presence, position and footprint were invented before the adoption and are
invented after it; what each gains is an argued occupant instead of a blank. This is the backfill
the block never had: it landed on 2026-08-14, one day before rule 6 took its third test, and is the
last block of this parcel shape to be asked the question.

**The block was measured rather than remembered, which is the only reason the next paragraph
exists.** `tools/measure_adoption_tests.py <family> south`, run on all five of its dwellings, prints
one claimant for the D3 (the carpenters), one for the D1 (the labourers), none at all for the D5,
and — as at eight blocks before this one — a "second roof" for each of the two trades: the D4 on lot
6 for the carpenters and the D2 on lot 5 for the labourers.

**WHAT THE SECOND ROOFS PASS ON IS NOT WHAT SIXTEEN REFUSALS HAVE ASSUMED, AND THIS IS THE ENTRY'S
REAL ADMISSION.** Rule 6's second test asks whether the roof's family is one this layer already
houses the trade in, and its third whether the roof's division is. The layer houses trades in
(family, division) PAIRS, and the rule states in its own text that *the three tests are
independent* — so the two tests read the two projections of that table, and a roof can pass on a
family taken out of one division and a division taken out of another family. Both second roofs are
exactly that:

- one carpenter household lives in a D4, and it stands in the **North** Division; all thirteen
  carpenters this layer houses in the **South** Division live in a D3;
- four labouring households live in a D2, and all four stand in the **North** or the **West**; all
  eleven labourers this layer houses in the **South** Division live in a D1.

`tools/measure_adoption_tests.py --pairs`, added here, prints the whole table: **20 (family,
division) pairs across 8 trades are admitted by the projections and housed by nothing**, and test 1
narrows the ones that could actually be adopted to **two** — the carpenters' D4/south and the
labourers' D2/south. Those two pairs are the entire content of the second-roof question ROADMAP K28
has been collecting evidence on since T-A9.

**The liberty admitted here is that this project has been refusing something it never measured.**
Nine blocks recorded a refusal of a candidacy each of them described as a trade's second roof; not
one of them checked that the layer had ever housed that trade in that family in that division, and
none of them had. The refusals are unchanged and the adoptions they protected are unchanged — the
conservative reading gave the same answer either way, which is luck rather than method.

**AND THE STRICTER READING IS NOT ADOPTED, BECAUSE IT WOULD REFUSE A HOUSEHOLD THIS LAYER ALREADY
STANDS ON.** Requiring the pair would refuse the fourteenth labouring household — T-A4's D1 adopted
in the WEST Division, when this layer housed labourers west of the river only in D2 shanties, argued
in exactly the projected form. Rule 6 names that adoption as one of the four decisions its third
test *recovers*, so a pair reading breaks the calibration the rule rests on. The new column reports
and gates nothing; K28 decides, with both facts committed.

**Consequence:** 104 anonymous roofs now carry an argued occupant rather than 102, and the town
holds 101 inferred households and 113 inferred persons — none of them named, none of them drawn
(L1). **Standing roofs are unchanged at 322 and the 665-roof remainder at 343**: this parcel added no
building and touched no lot. The block's three open lots stay open, with the reasons T-A3 committed
for each — one refused civic slot, two on the alternating-vacancy assumption — because housing a
household by filling one would be the fitting-the-model-to-the-drawing rule 6 exists to stop. A
visitor clicking either adopted roof is told who the layer supposes lived there, that the supposition
is a hypothesis and not a person, and that the roof itself is still an invention.

**The eleventh K20 measurement is 67 of 111** carried-over invented persons renamed, against 12-of-110
at T-A15, 61-of-108 at T-A14 and 7-of-102 at T-A11. Two insertions landed in the middle of this
layer's two largest buckets, which is the case K20 predicts is worst. No grade moved, every
`name_basis` kept its pool citation, and `check.sh` re-derives all 113.

**How to resolve:** the same evidence the block itself wants — parcel-level tax, deed or assessment
records naming who held and occupied these lots on Randolph or Washington between Dearborn and State
in July 1835. A named occupant replaces an inferred one; it never adds a household to the census.

**Covers:** `recon_1835_blk_randolph_dearborn_d1_04.occupants`,
`recon_1835_blk_randolph_dearborn_d3_01.occupants`
**Recorded:** 2026-08-15.
**Resolved:** 2026-09-02, by the owner's ruling that retired the reconstructed resident population — "remove any pre-existing reconstructed people from the resident list and household" — and, asked whether the roofs they occupied should be abandoned or kept, "Keep as anonymous stock." The adoption this entry records was WITHDRAWN rather than corrected: the households that made it no longer exist, so the two roofs went back to being the anonymous count-units the other eight always were, and the `occupants` block this entry covers is gone from both records. Nothing was built, moved or regraded on the way out either — the roofs stand exactly where this entry put them, unassigned until the placement sweep the same ruling asks for. T-0516 carried the withdrawal to the records (2026-09-05); the argument that raised the households is kept as history in `data/reconstruction/1835_inferred_household_programme.json`.

## Per-subject liberties

### L4 — Sauganash Hotel: the gallery question, and how it was decided
**Decision (revised same day):** **no** gallery, tagged `inferred`.
**Why:** no period source attests one either way. The first reading followed the secondary
literature, which describes the surviving retrospective images as disagreeing, and modelled a
gallery as `conjectural`. Examining the two images the project actually holds — the Braunhold
engraving in Andreas (1884) and Kurz & Allison panel 14 (1893) — showed both depicting the
building with **no** veranda. Since the Kurz & Allison composition is probably copied from
Andreas, that is one witness and a copy rather than two, so the finding is `inferred`, not
`documented`.
**Worth noting as a process point:** the correction came from looking at the pictures instead of
reading about the pictures. Both are in the repo and both were a minute's work to open.
**How to resolve further:** any pre-1860 depiction or a written description.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09. **Revised:** 2026-08-09.

### L4a — Sauganash Hotel: the log wing is inferred from two derivative images
**Decision:** the 1829 log cabin is modelled as an attached single-story wing on the 1831
building, tagged `inferred`.
**Why:** both retrospective depictions draw it plainly, with log courses and corner notching,
and it matches the documentary account that the frame block was "built onto" the cabin. But the
two images are not independent, and neither is a period record.
**Consequence:** the `frame_tavern` archetype has to support an attached log wing — a Milestone 0
geometry requirement that came out of the evidence rather than the plan.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09.

### L5 — Sauganash Hotel: the frame block's DEPTH is invented, and now it is the only half that is
**Decision:** the frame block's footprint is 9.92 × 8 m and the 8 m is a placeholder. The
frontage is measured (see below); the depth is a plausible figure for the type carrying no
evidence at all, and the two are graded together at the weaker.
**Why:** no source reached states a dimension of this building, and one drawn view cannot give a
depth — `docs/RESEARCH/sauganash_image_accuracy.md` row 11 — so a sheet that fixes the frontage
leaves the depth exactly where it was. It is held at the old placeholder's own number rather
than re-guessed, because the placement derivation offsets this origin by the footprint's depth
to stand the north face on Lake Street, and moving a number with nothing behind it would move
the building.
**Resolved in part, 2026-09-04 (T-0626):** two of the three rectangles this entry used to
admit are no longer inventions. The 12 m frontage was retired for a measured 9.92 m — five bays
that rectify to equal against the plate's own vanishing point, at a scale datum whose bias the
same pass bounded at 2.7 %, which refutes 12 m rather than merely failing to support it. And
the `log_1829` cabin's 7 × 6 m placeholder was retired for Andreas' attested 16 × 20 ft, once
`drloih_beaubien` identified that cabin with the log building Andreas measures; that value is
`inferred` on the identification and is out of this entry's Covers.
**How to resolve:** Andreas vol. 1 p. 106 at page-image level; then the Hathaway 1834 building
rectangle once the datum is verified. A second view of this building from a DIFFERENT station
would give the depth directly — every view held is the same composition.
**Covers:** `sauganash_hotel.frame_1831.footprint`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09.

### L6 — Sauganash Hotel: the pre-1830 position is not represented
**Decision:** the `log_1829` phase is placed at the post-move Lake & Market site for its whole
span, although the cabin stood somewhere else until about 1830.
**Why:** the original site is described only as "near the forks, on the south side" and as
having fallen inside a platted street — not precisely enough to place. Splitting the phase would
require inventing the first position.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09.

### L7 — Wolf Point: three buildings placed from bank geometry, not from a corner
**Decision:** `wolf_point_tavern`, `miller_house` and `walker_meeting_house` are positioned by
deriving a coordinate from the datum origin at the forks and from **modern** riverbank geometry
(OpenStreetMap water polygons), because **no surviving intersection locates any of them**. The
Sauganash method — half an 80 ft platted street off a documented corner — does not apply.
**Why:** the streets that once ran past them either never existed (the north-bank point was
platted in Kinzie's Addition in 1833–35 and largely unbuilt) or have been rebuilt out of
recognition. The relative positions *are* attested — the west-bank row runs James Kinzie's house,
the tavern, the meeting house from south to north; Miller's house is on the point between the
North Branch and the main stem — so the coordinates are constrained, not free.
**Consequence:** these three carry a larger and *differently shaped* uncertainty than the corner
buildings: roughly 40 m along the bank and 20 m across it, plus an unquantified allowance for the
modern bank not being the 1835 bank. Each record states its own figure in its position note. The
sidecar's flat `uncertainty_m: 20` understates them.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09.

### L8 — Three footprints at Wolf Point are invented outright
**Decision:** the footprints of `wolf_point_tavern` (12 × 7 m), `miller_house` (a 9 × 11 m L) and
`walker_meeting_house` (7 × 7 m) are placeholders tagged `conjectural`, citing no sources.
**Why:** no period map shows building footprints (verified for both 1834 sheets), and no text
reached measures any of these three. What *is* attested in two cases is a **shape** rather than a
size — Miller's house as a two-storey range fronting the river with a log cabin behind, Walker's
as "a small square log building" — so the polygons carry an attested proportion at an invented
scale. That distinction is stated in each footprint note.
**How to resolve:** Andreas vol. 1, "Wharfs, Piers and Early Hotels", pp. 626–631, at page-image
level.
**Covers:** `wolf_point_tavern.footprint`, `miller_house.footprint`, `walker_meeting_house.footprint`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09.

### L9 — Green Tree Tavern: the footprint is derived from a room, and the side additions are left off
**Decision:** the footprint (12.19 × 7.62 m ≈ 40 × 25 ft) is **derived** from the attested 12 ft
room module, the ~8 ft central hall and the two-rank depth, tagged `inferred`; the low one-storey
additions at each end are recorded on the record but **excluded from the geometry**.
**Why:** it is the only footprint in the parcel with a textual basis, but what is attested is the
module, not the count — a three-room side gives ~52 ft, so the length is good to about ±20%. The
side additions are attested by John Gray, landlord 1838–41, which is *after* the scene date, and
nothing dates them; modelling them would assert they existed in July 1835.
**How to resolve:** the c. 1859 photograph (CHM ICHi-040230), which shows the building at its
original corner and would settle dimensions, exterior finish and the gallery at once.
**Covers:** `green_tree_tavern.frame_1833.form.side_additions`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09.
**Revised:** 2026-08-10 — the omission is now claimed rather than described. The record carries
`side_additions: true` and the `frame_tavern` archetype has no parameter for it, so the attribute
reaches the mesh nowhere; the record says so with `geometry: "absent"` and this entry is what the
gate matches that declaration against.

### L10 — Western Hotel: the stable and wagon yard are attested and not modelled
**Decision:** only the hotel block is built. The "large stable and the yard into which the trains
were driven", with entrances from both streets, are recorded as `stables: true` and left out of
the geometry. The L's **arm widths** (7.0 m) are invented; only its 40 × 60 ft envelope is
attested.
**Why:** neither the stable nor the yard is dimensioned or located, and the `frame_tavern`
archetype builds a building, not a parcel.
**Consequence:** this understates the site more than any confidence tag can express — the yard
*is* the west-side teamsters' house as a visitor experienced it, and the model shows a hotel
standing in nothing. A parcel-level or yard archetype would fix it.
**Covers:** `western_hotel.frame_1834.form.stables`, `western_hotel_stable.stable_1834.form.wagon_yard`.
**Revised:** 2026-08-11 — **narrowed, not resolved: the stable is now built and the yard still is
not.** `data/structures/western_hotel_stable.json` stands the large stable behind the hotel on the
attested relation — "In the rear was the large stable and the yard into which the trains were
driven" — so the half of this entry that said a hotel stands in nothing is no longer true of the
stable. THE YARD REMAINS OUT OF THE MODEL AND CANNOT BE PUT IN IT BY THIS ARCHETYPE. A yard is an
enclosure — a fence line, two gateways and the ground between them — and `outbuilding` builds a
building; using it here would mean calling a fence a building, which is a worse claim than the
omission. The two gateways, on Randolph and on Canal, are unbuilt for the same reason. The
admission has therefore MOVED AS WELL AS SHRUNK: it now sits on the stable's own record as
`form.wagon_yard: {value: true, confidence: "documented", geometry: "absent"}`, beside the building
it belonged to, while `western_hotel.frame_1834.form.stables` keeps its own `geometry: "absent"`
because the hotel's mesh still contains no stable. WHAT WOULD RESOLVE THIS ENTRY RATHER THAN
NARROW IT AGAIN: an enclosure archetype. The same missing archetype is why `estray_pen` is drawn as
a roofed shed, why Clybourn's stockyard is unmodelled, and why the pig pens the town code of
November 1833 implies have nowhere to go.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09.
**Revised:** 2026-08-10 — claimed rather than merely described. `stables` is `documented`, which
is the strongest chip this project has, and it sits over a building with no stable within a
hundred metres of it; the record now declares `geometry: "absent"` and the gate holds that
declaration to this entry.
**Revised:** 2026-08-18 — **THE YARD IS DRAWN.** `data/enclosures/western_hotel_wagon_yard.json`
and `renderers/web/js/enclosures.js` are the enclosure archetype's renderer half, and this entry
is what asked for them: a perimeter, a fence type and the two attested gateways, with no roof and
no footprint. The sentence above — "a yard is an enclosure … and `outbuilding` builds a building"
— is no longer a reason for the yard to be absent from the scene, and standing in the rear of the
Western Hotel you are now standing inside a fenced yard with a gate onto Canal and a gate onto
Randolph. **What is NOT resolved, and why this entry stays open.** `western_hotel_stable
.stable_1834.form.wagon_yard` still declares `geometry: "absent"` and still belongs here, because
that declaration is about the OUTBUILDING ARCHETYPE'S MESH, which contains no yard and never
will; the yard is a second record drawn by a second layer. `western_hotel.frame_1834.form.stables`
is untouched for the same reason. And the fence itself is an invention from end to end — see
**L127**, which claims it. Clybourn's stockyard and the pig pens the November 1833 town code
implies are still unbuilt, and the estray pen (**L60**) is still a roofed box: this layer makes
both of those buildable, and neither is built here.

### L11 — Western Hotel: one completed phase on a disputed date, rather than a construction phase
**Decision:** modelled as complete and in operation on 1835-07-01, on the 1834 build date, with
no `construction_1835` phase.
**Why:** the date is disputed 1834 (the builder W. H. Stow's own word, with corroborating detail)
against 1835 (an undated line in a chronology that also mis-sizes the building). A construction
phase would have to invent a start month, a duration and a degree of completeness that no source
gives — and would silently adopt the weaker date in order to have something to model.
**How to resolve:** any account of the Western independent of Stow. If 1835 is confirmed, split
the phase then.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09.

### L12 — Walker Meeting House: placed on one side of a disputed river
**Decision:** placed on the **west** bank, north of the Wolf Point Tavern, position tagged
`inferred`.
**Why:** two near-primary witnesses (Wau-Bun 1831; chicagology's transcribed recollection) put a
Walker-built log worship-and-school building on the west bank and give a *relative position* that
can be placed. The competing reading — the successor congregation's own history, "in 1834 the
growing congregation built a log cabin north of the Chicago River" — is modern, unfootnoted, and
gives a division rather than a location.
**Consequence:** **if the north-bank reading is right, this building is about 150 m from where it
is drawn, on the far side of the North Branch.** The likeliest reconciliation is that both are
true of *different* buildings — an 1831 school-house on the west bank and a purpose-built 1834
cabin on the north — in which case the model has the wrong one. Note also that
`data/exclusions.json` states in passing that the 1835 meeting house is on the north bank; that
file and this record disagree and neither was edited to match the other.
**How to resolve:** Andreas on the early Methodist society; the congregation's own archives; or
the reported 1835 painting showing Wolf Tavern, Miller's House and Walker's cabin in one view.
**Covers:** `walker_meeting_house.log_1831.position`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-09. **Revised:** 2026-08-10 — the Decision line above still reads
`inferred`, which is what this entry claimed when it was written. The record was downgraded to
`conjectural` on 2026-08-09, on the reasoning in its own position note: choosing between two
readings 150 m apart across a river is a coin flip with an argument attached, not a derivation.
The `Covers:` claim is the binding statement of what this entry discharges; the stale word is
left standing because the file is append-only and a silently corrected admission is not one.

### L14 — Terrain: a conjectural micro-relief under every claim
**Decision:** the land surface carries ±0.10 ft (30 mm) of two-octave value noise everywhere,
and the `_CONFIDENCE` channel does **not** report it.
**Why:** no contour survey of the 1835 town site exists, so the terrain is a set of zone levels
from period narrative feet, and a zone level rendered literally is a dead-flat plane that reads
as a rendering error rather than as ground — and gives a walker no motion parallax to judge
distance by. The noise is a texture, not a claim: its amplitude is below the 0.25 ft the dossier
asks the heightmap to be *quantised* at, and far below the resolution of any statement in the
record. The confidence channel carries the zone's tag because the zone level is the claim being
made. Setting `micro_relief.amplitude_ft` to 0 in `terrain_spec.json` removes it entirely.
**Consequence:** the plain is measurably rougher at cell scale (2.8 ft per 300 ft) than the
dossier's flatness rule, while the *block* gradient the rule is actually about stays inside it
(0.47 ft per 300 ft). The generator prints both on every run.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L15 — Terrain: the west-prairie swales are invented alignments
**Decision:** two shallow swales (0.75 and 0.6 ft deep) cross the West Division wet prairie,
tagged `conjectural` and rendered dithered-translucent in the confidence view.
**Why:** dossier zone 18 says the West Division carried "1–2 ft slough swales", so that swales
existed is inferred from a source. **Where they ran is attested nowhere**, and these two
alignments were drawn to make the wet prairie read as wet prairie rather than as a lawn. They
are the only piece of terrain geometry in this parcel invented outright.
**How to resolve:** the 1821 GLO township plat land-cover, or the ISGS "Illinois Landcover in
the Early 1800s" digitisation, both named in the dossier and neither reached.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L16 — Terrain: the water is a wall to the walker
**Decision:** the heightfield carries the real channel bed (about −12 ft in the main stem), the
ground mesh draws it, and the walker cannot enter the water — `terrain.height()` reports a
barrier at the waterline instead of the bed.
**Why:** a walker whose eye is pinned to the bed walks into the river and looks at the town from
under the water, which reads as a bug rather than as a river. This is a navigation rule, not a
claim about the terrain: nothing about the modelled ground changes, and `groundHeight()` still
reports the truth. It is a liberty because a person in 1835 could in fact cross — by the ferry
at Wolf Point, or by boat — and the model currently offers neither.
**Known edge:** a walker *teleported* into the channel — by a camera anchor or by the test
harness, never by walking — stands on the barrier and appears to float. Every anchor in
`data/scenes/1835.json` is on land (the `forks` placeholder that was not has been moved), so it
is not reachable in normal use, but it is the shape of the compromise and it is written down
rather than discovered.
**How to resolve:** model the ferry and the bridges as structures, then let the walker use them.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L17 — Terrain: the ground continues past the modelled box as a radial skirt
**Decision:** the heightfield covers a 640 m square around the forks. Beyond it the ground mesh
carries each boundary height radially outward to 1400 m, so the river widens into the fog rather
than ending at a cliff.
**Why:** the alternative — a hard edge at 320 m — is a worse lie than a smeared one, and the
scene's fog is total by 1500 m. Nothing outside the box is modelled, sampled, or claimed: the
heightfield's own sampler returns its fallback there, and the skirt is geometry for the horizon
only.
**Consequence:** the main stem appears to widen as it recedes east. Anyone extending the model
east to the harbour replaces the skirt with real terrain rather than editing it.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

**Revised 2026-08-11 — two statements in the text above are now false, and the east half of this
entry is retired.** The box is no longer "a 640 m square": S2e extended it to **E −320 … +1700,
N −400 … +400**, 2 020 × 800 m. Modelled ground now reaches **300 m past where the old skirt itself
ended**, so nothing east of the town is skirt any more — the shore, the 1834 cut, the sand bar, the
old southward channel, Fort Dearborn's site and twenty-odd buildings all stood in it and now stand
on real terrain. In area, 0.966 km² of the old 7.43 km² skirt has become ground. **The stated
consequence is retired with it**: the main stem no longer "appears to widen as it recedes east",
because it runs to its actual mouth inside the box, and what recedes east is open lake.

**And the skirt is no longer radial**, which matters more than it sounds. Radial scaling on a
2 020 × 800 rectangle pushes the east edge out by a quarter of what it pushes the north — backwards,
since east is the direction with the most to hide. It is now a **rectangular apron of 1 500 m per
side**, which is also the first time the skirt actually reaches the distance this entry's own
argument leans on: the old radial construction reached only 1 080 m beyond the edge while the text
claimed 1400. So the apron is **larger in absolute area than the thing it replaced** — 17.46 km²
against 7.43 — and that is worth admitting in the same breath as the good news, because the part
that mattered is gone and the part that grew is prairie and lake nobody looks at.

What has NOT changed: nothing outside the box is modelled, sampled or claimed, the heightfield's own
sampler returns its fallback there, and the apron is geometry for the horizon only. It costs 2 256
vertices.

**Revised 2026-08-23 — the apron is 1 549.921875 m per side, and the odd number is the point
(T-0152).** The width is no longer chosen; it is DERIVED, and by something that has nothing to do
with the horizon. `tools/web_derivatives.sh` quantises the published ground's POSITION under one
uniform node scale taken from the mesh's widest axis — which is the box plus two apron widths — so
the apron is what sets the rung every ground vertex is rounded onto. At 1 500 m that rung was
76.6 mm and 2.5 m of terrain grid was 32.64 of them, so vertices landed BETWEEN rungs, moved in
plan by up to 51.9 mm, and were then conformed to the field's height for the wrong place: 77 mm of
error on the east bank faces, where the road ribbon has 22 mm. `generators/terrain_gen.py` now
takes the smallest apron of at least 1 500 m for which the rung is an exact submultiple of the grid
— the cell over 32, 78.125 mm — and every vertex stands on a rung, so quantising rounds it to
itself. Measured: plan movement 0.0 mm.

Three things are worth saying plainly about that. The apron grew by 49.921875 m per side, so it
still clears the distance this entry's argument leans on, by more than it did. **The area grew
with it — 18.35 km² against 17.46** — and the same admission as 2026-08-11 applies: what grew is
prairie and lake nobody looks at. And it still costs 2 256 vertices, because the ring is the same
ring; only its outer rectangle moved.

### L18 — Sauganash Hotel: the 1829 cabin's height and its roof are placeholders
**Decision:** the `log_1829` phase is built 2.4 m to the plate under a gable roof, both tagged
`conjectural`, both carrying the word PLACEHOLDER in their own notes.
**Why:** nothing attests either. 2.4 m is an ordinary single-storey hewn-log wall and a gable is
the near-universal roof for the type and the period — but the ordinary reading of a *type* is not
evidence about a *building*, and that is exactly where this project draws the line between
`inferred` and `conjectural`. The 1831 frame block's height and roof are `inferred` because the
reasoning is about that block: two storeys are documented and the form is described. The cabin
has neither, so its numbers were chosen rather than derived.
**Consequence:** the oldest thing standing in the scene — the attached wing of L4a, which a
visitor walks straight past — has an invented height and an invented roof. The dithered massing
says its size is unknown; it does not say that 2.4 m and a gable were picked because they are
usual.
**How to resolve:** any dimensioned description of the 1829 cabin. Failing that, the Braunhold
engraving at page-image level, where the wing's height can be measured against a block whose
storey count is documented.
**Covers:** `sauganash_hotel.log_1829.form.wall_height_m`, `sauganash_hotel.log_1829.form.roof_type`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L19 — Green Tree and Western: two galleries decided by default, not by evidence
**Decision:** `gallery: false` on both the Green Tree Tavern and the Western Hotel, tagged
`conjectural` on both. Both buildings render with a plain front.
**Why:** no source reached describes a porch, veranda or gallery on either building, and none
rules one out. False is what the archetype falls back to, not a finding. The Green Tree's
witnesses describe two entrances — the front on Canal and one "about the middle of the long side"
on Lake — without mentioning a porch, which is weak negative evidence at best: they were
correcting a drawing, not inventorying an elevation. The Western is more open still. A wagon
house with entrances to its yard from both streets is precisely the type that often carried a
porch over the door, and nothing here says it did not.
**Consequence:** this is an invention that does not look like one. A drawn footprint announces
itself — the visitor can see that a shape was chosen. A plain elevation reads as the finding,
and the confidence tint on an attribute whose value is `false` has nothing to dither. Recorded
here because the model shows two blank fronts that no source put there.
**How to resolve:** the c. 1859 photograph (CHM ICHi-040230) settles the Green Tree the moment
anyone opens it. For the Western, any depiction at all — the project holds none.
**Covers:** `green_tree_tavern.frame_1833.form.gallery`, `western_hotel.frame_1834.form.gallery`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L22 — Wall surfaces are the archetype's, not the record's
**Decision:** `cladding` on the four frame buildings and `paint` on the three log ones are
recorded and unread. Frame walls always get clapboard lap courses; log walls always get bare
hewn log. A record saying `cladding: board_and_batten` or `paint: white` on a log core would
change nothing on screen.
**Why:** each archetype was written for the buildings it had, and every one of them is
clapboarded or unpainted, so the fixed surface and the recorded value have never differed. The
`frame_paint` parameter drives a frame addition's colour; nothing drives the log core's.
**Consequence:** the dataset's weakest inferences are here — `cladding` and `paint` are
`inferred` on almost every record, several of them explicitly "not attested either way" — and a
visitor cannot tell that the surface they are looking at is the archetype's default rather than
the record's reading. Where evidence is thin, an unread attribute is a claim made twice.
**How to resolve:** wire both attributes through `from_phase` and re-bake. Note the ordering
this creates: the Sauganash's documented white paint IS read, so painted frame is already
data-driven; it is the surface *texture* that is not.
**Covers:** `green_tree_tavern.form.cladding`, `miller_house.form.cladding`, `sauganash_hotel.form.cladding`, `western_hotel.form.cladding`, `miller_house.form.paint`, `walker_meeting_house.form.paint`, `wolf_point_tavern.form.paint`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L23 — One window arrangement, on every frame building
**Decision:** `fenestration` is recorded on the three frame taverns and read by none of them.
The archetype builds the same elevation on all three: five bays above, four plus a centred door
below.
**Why:** the arrangement came from the two Sauganash depictions and was made the archetype's
default. The Green Tree's record says `small_paned_sash`, which describes the glazing and not
the layout, and the Western's says `regular_bays`, which describes the layout only loosely —
neither is a rhythm anyone could build from, so the default was never replaced.
**Consequence:** three buildings of different sizes wear one facade. The Western is 40 ft on its
front and the Sauganash's five-bay rhythm is spread across it unchanged, which reads as a
finding about how the town was built and is instead an artefact of one archetype.
**How to resolve:** a bay-count parameter derived from frontage, and records that state a rhythm
rather than a glazing type. Both, then a re-bake.
**Covers:** `green_tree_tavern.form.fenestration`, `sauganash_hotel.form.fenestration`, `western_hotel.form.fenestration`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L24 — Wolf Point Tavern: the frame bay's side, width and depth are invented
**Decision:** the frame half of the "partly log and partly frame" tavern is built as a
one-storey bay 4 m wide and the full 7 m depth of the footprint, at the north end of the log
core. Its side, its width and its depth are tagged `conjectural`; that it existed at all is
`documented` and its single storey is `inferred`.
**Why:** the evidence is one clause — "This building was partly log and partly frame" — and it
gives no dimension, no position on the building and no date. Something had to be built or the
documented half of the fabric stays invisible, which is the failure L20 records. So the numbers
are chosen and declared rather than defaulted: 4 m of a 12 m frontage keeps the building reading
as a log house with a frame piece rather than the reverse, which is the distinction that decides
which archetype the record belongs to at all; the full depth avoids a notch at the back corner
that would read as a modelled fact about the plan; and `end` is the cheapest way to enlarge a log
pen, since the ridge simply runs on and no log wall is cut.
**Consequence:** a visitor sees one specific frame bay in one specific place. The confidence view
dithers it by what it IS — documented that it existed, inferred that it was low — and not by its
unknown size, following the rule set for the Sauganash: dimensional uncertainty belongs in the
sidecar, where the popup shows it, rather than ghosting a building whose character is attested.
So the tint alone will not tell a visitor that the width is a guess. This entry does.
**How to resolve:** Andreas vol. 1 pp. 626-631 at page-image level, or the Braunhold retrospective
view of Wolf Point at plate level — the same two unopened sources that would settle the footprint.
**Covers:** `wolf_point_tavern.log_frame_1828.form.frame_addition_side`, `wolf_point_tavern.log_frame_1828.form.frame_addition_width_m`, `wolf_point_tavern.log_frame_1828.form.frame_addition_depth_m`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L25 — Wolf Point Tavern: the wolf on the sign is not drawn
**Decision:** the tavern's sign is modelled as a plain weathered board hanging from a bracket.
The painted wolf that gave the point its name is not depicted, and the board carries no image at
all. The record's `sign` value names the subject — `painted_wolf_sign` — so the popup can say
what hung there while the mesh says only that something hung there.
**Why:** the sign is documented and the image is not. No description of the painting survives —
not its size, not the board's shape, not how the wolf was drawn, not whether it was a whole
animal or a head — and a wolf painted from imagination would be the most conspicuous invention in
the scene, on the one object every visitor will walk up to. The bracket, the arm length and the
board's proportions are invented too; they are archetype geometry rather than record values, in
the same way L22 covers wall surfaces.
**Consequence:** the most famous object at Wolf Point is present and blank. That is the honest
reading — a board hung there, and we do not know what was on it — but it is a deliberate absence
a visitor might otherwise take for an unfinished model.
**How to resolve:** any period description or depiction of the board. None is held.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.
**SUPERSEDED 2026-08-21 by L165 (T-0072).** A period description WAS held, in a source this
project already carried: chicagology's Wolf's Point note says a picture of a wolf was painted on
the board, that the fort blacksmith made its hinges and that it hung on a sapling. The entry above
is kept verbatim because its argument — that an invented image would be the most conspicuous
fabrication in the scene — is the right question, and L165 answers it rather than ignoring it. What
this entry got wrong is that a blank board is not the neutral option when a source says otherwise.

### L26 — Every chimney stands where the archetype puts it
**Decision:** the records count the stacks and the archetypes place them. On a frame block
(`sauganash_hotel`, `green_tree_tavern`, `western_hotel`) they sit on the ridge line, spaced
evenly between 0.22 and 0.78 of the frontage. On a log building (`wolf_point_tavern`,
`miller_house`, `walker_meeting_house`) the first stands outside the log core's gable wall, and a
second — where a record counts two — stands against the outer gable of the frame addition. Every
stack is the same 0.96 m square shaft with a corbelled head, rising 0.55 m above the ridge it
passes.
**Why:** not one source in this dataset describes a chimney on any of these six buildings. What
the sources give is a count, and only for the Sauganash is even that drawn ("both depictions show
two"); everything else — position, size, material, whether the stack was inside the wall or
against it — is typological. Something has to be built, because a heated tavern with no stack is
a claim too, and a stated count with no geometry is the failure L21 records. So the arrangement
is argued rather than preferred: an exterior gable-end stack is the frontier pattern for a log
pen, a pair on the ridge is what a central-hall frame block carries, and the second stack on
Miller's house goes on the frame range because *the record's own reasoning for counting two* is
"a stack in each element" — building both on the log core would honour the number and contradict
the argument for it.
**Consequence:** the confidence tint on a stack is the count's — `inferred` on every building
here — and a visitor reasonably reads that as covering the thing they are looking at. It does
not. It covers *how many*, and nothing at all about *where*, *how big* or *made of what*. This
entry is the only place that distinction is legible.
**How to resolve:** any depiction at plate level. The two retrospective Sauganash images would
settle position and rough proportion for that building alone; nothing held would settle the
others.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L27 — Miller House: the frame range's width and depth come from an invented plan
**Decision:** the two-storey range fronting the river is built 9 m wide and 6 m deep — the whole
frontage of the footprint and a little over half its depth — with the log cabin occupying the 5 m
behind it. Both numbers are tagged `conjectural`. That the range existed, that it stood on the
river front and that it was two storeys are all `documented`; only its size is invented.
**Why:** the sources give this building a composition and never a dimension. "A two-story house
added to the cabin, fronting the river" and the 1833 view's "a two-story building and adjoining
log cabin" say what the parts were and how they sat, and no source reached says how big either
one was. The width and depth are therefore read off this record's own footprint polygon, whose
river-fronting limb is 9 × 6 m, rather than picked afresh — which makes the mesh agree with the
plan the record already draws instead of taking the archetype's defaults of half the width and
half the depth, a 4.5 m block in the middle of a frontage the polygon draws full-width. That is a
smaller invention than a new number and it is still an invention, because the polygon is a
PLACEHOLDER: its own note says every number in it is made up. A fraction of a guess, exactly as
L24 says of the Wolf Point bay.
**Consequence:** two things a visitor cannot see from the confidence tint. The range is dithered
by what it IS — documented that it existed and was two storeys — and not by its unknown size,
which is the rule set for the Sauganash and repeated for Wolf Point in L24. And the record draws
an L while the archetype masses a rectangle: the log core is carved out of the footprint's
bounding box, so it comes out the full 9 m wide rather than the polygon's 6 m, and the 3 × 5 m
re-entrant corner behind the range is filled in. Stating the range's own numbers is what makes
that visible — before this slice the defaults left an inverted-T that matched neither the polygon
nor the sources.
**How to resolve:** Andreas vol. 1, "Wharfs, Piers and Early Hotels" pp. 626-631 at page-image
level — the same unopened source that would settle the footprint this inherits from.
**Covers:** `miller_house.log_frame_1827.form.frame_addition_width_m`, `miller_house.log_frame_1827.form.frame_addition_depth_m`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.


### L31 — The two bents are where a builder would put them, not where anybody saw them
**Decision:** the North Branch bridge's two bents stand at the third points of its 71.83 m span,
23.94 m and 47.89 m from the west landing, each built as four heavy logs under a cap log. The
count and the form are `documented`; **the stations are the archetype's**, and so is everything
about a bent except how many logs stood in it.
**Why:** the 1883 old-settlers statement gives a count and a construction and no geometry —
"built on abutments and two 'bents'", the abutments "in the shallow water near the banks" and
the bents "resting on the bottom, in deeper water". That locates them by depth, which this
project cannot use: no source gives the channel's bed profile at the crossing and the
heightfield models nothing below the waterline, so "deeper water" cannot be turned into a
station. Even thirds are therefore what a builder would do with three roughly equal stringer
runs, and they are not a finding. The alternative — biasing the two toward the middle to match
"in deeper water" against a guessed channel section — would invent a riverbed in order to place
a pier, which is two inventions where this is one.
**Consequence:** three things a visitor cannot read off the confidence view, and this entry is
where they are legible. The chip on `pier_count` grades **how many**, and a visitor standing on
the bank sees exactly where they are. The girth of the logs, the cap, and the fact that the four
stand in a row across the deck rather than paired are the archetype's throughout. And the
letter's most specific phrase — *resting on the bottom*, which is what distinguishes a bent from
a driven pile bent — is invisible in the model, because nothing below half a metre under the
waterline is built at all.
**A fourth thing, and it is the honest cost of the repair.** Three spans instead of sixteen
makes each stringer run 23.9 m, and nobody was moving a 23.9 m timber. The letter says stringers
"stretched from the abutments to the bents, and between the bents" and never says they were
single sticks; they were spliced somewhere and no source says where. The mesh shows one log per
bay, so the splices are **omitted** rather than invented — the same choice L30 makes about the
approach, one order of magnitude smaller.
**How to resolve:** a survey, a section, or a repair account with dimensions. Andreas's main text
records that a committee was appointed in December 1833 "to see that they were properly
repaired" and that "in September the corporation paid $166.67 on account of repairing" — a
voucher or a council minute behind that payment is the most likely thing to describe the
structure member by member.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L31a — Terrain: the bank face is a shape nobody recorded
**Decision:** the ground rises from the waterline to the local bank crest on an eased quadratic over **6 m** by default, widening east where the south and north shores climb into the sand ridge. The profile string in `terrain_spec.json` is a description of the generator's ramp, not an input it reads.
**Why:** no source gives a bank cross-section at any point in this scene. The bank has to meet two constraints at once — it must reach Z = 0 exactly at the traced waterline, and it must arrive at the crest heights the dossier argues for without producing a cliff. The ease-out ramp is therefore geometry chosen to satisfy the known endpoints, not evidence in itself.
**Consequence:** a visitor sees a shaped bank carrying the project's confidence tint, but the tint on the block says only how sure we are about the heights and zones around it. The actual curvature of the bank face is ours. The note is where that distinction is stated.
**How to resolve:** any period section, profile, or measured description of a bank at the forks or harbour reach.
**Covers:** `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.bank`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L31b — Terrain: the channel cross-section carries no evidence at all
**Decision:** water depth approaches the stated bed with an exponential law, `depth = bed_ft * (1 - exp(-d_in / e_fold_m))`, where distance is measured in from the traced waterline.
**Why:** the project has period statements about bed depths at a few places and none about cross-sections. A smooth curve is what lets the surface meet the bank at Z = 0 exactly on the traced line while still giving the river and cut a usable interior depth. That is a modelling convenience chosen under total evidential silence.
**Consequence:** the geometry under the water is an answer to a renderer's question, not a historical finding. It affects boat draught and the hidden shape of the channel and nothing a visitor can see directly.
**How to resolve:** any pre-dredging cross-section or sounding transect of the Chicago River, the 1834 cut or the old southward channel.
**Covers:** `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.channel_profile`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L31c — Terrain: the north-side slough is one foot deep because a shallower one would not read
**Decision:** the slough off the Main Branch is cut to a bed of **−1.0 ft** with a 1.2 m e-folding distance, and the whole block is tagged `conjectural` in `terrain_spec.json`.
**Why:** its existence and its course are Wright 1834's, drawn on the sheet this terrain is fitted to, and its width is measured off the drafted band. Its **depth is invented outright** — no sounding, no description, nothing. One foot is the shallowest figure that still reads as water at the surface, which is a rendering argument and not a historical one, and the 1.2 m e-fold overrides the river's 9 m for the same reason: at 9 m a 1 ft channel would be four inches deep across a 7 m width and would look like damp grass.
**Consequence:** the grade a visitor sees on this claim is the block's, so it says `conjectural` about a watercourse whose existence and course are the best-attested thing in this quadrant. The note is the only place that distinction is legible, which is a limit of block-level grading and not of the evidence — see `docs/STATUS.md`.
**Why it is recorded now:** it is the one ground invention the terrain slice never wrote down. The coverage gate found it the first time it was allowed to look at the terrain spec.
**How to resolve:** any pre-dredging sounding of the north-side backwater, or a description of it as fordable or not.
**Covers:** `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.watercourses.north_side_slough`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L31d — Terrain: the ground says what it is made of and nothing is made of it
**Decision:** the spec grades multiple surface materials — black loam over quicksand over blue clay, beach-and-dune sand, peat muck with sedge, reeds and rushes, Cahokia Alluvium silt — and **no surface in the model is made of any of them**. The ground mesh carries one earth treatment unless and until the surface parcel builds otherwise.
**Why:** the material entries are the dossier's surface table, kept in the spec because they are what a terrain claim *is*, and `terrain_gen.py` builds elevation and water only. Colouring or texturing ground by zone is a later parcel, and doing it badly — inventing a palette for a soil nobody photographed — would be a larger invention than leaving it out.
**Consequence:** a visitor reading a strong confidence grade on one of these rows is reading how sure the project is about the site's stratigraphy, not a description of the literal surface underfoot. The row needs an explicit admission because the mesh does not embody it.
**How to resolve:** a surface-treatment parcel driven from these entries, with the palette argued from the sources rather than picked.
**Covers:** `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.surface_materials.south_division west of State St`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.surface_materials.south_division east of State St`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.surface_materials.north_division`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.surface_materials.north_division near the lake`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.surface_materials.west_division`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.surface_materials.south_division_marsh`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.surface_materials.channel`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.surface_materials.open_lake_shelf`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.surface_materials.sand_bar_1834`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L31e — Terrain: two water bodies keep invented beds because the sources give only their existence
**Decision:** the abandoned southward channel behind the bar is given a bed of **−2.5 ft**, and the open-lake shelf east of the traced water is given a bed of **−11.0 ft** with a long 130 m e-fold. Both are tagged `conjectural`.
**Why:** Wright 1834 and later discussion tell this project that both water bodies existed; neither gives a sounding on the date this scene models. The old channel is therefore placed between the dossier's qualitative banks as a midpoint, and the open lake shelf exists to stop the harbour from ending in a wall where the traced window ends. Both figures are modelling choices under evidential silence.
**Consequence:** the harbour opens into plausible water rather than into a box edge, and the abandoned channel remains a watercourse rather than collapsing flat. Neither depth is a measurement and neither should be read as one.
**How to resolve:** any pre-dredging sounding or section of the old outlet channel or the nearshore lake bed east of the cut.
**Covers:** `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.reaches.old_south_channel`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.reaches.open_lake_shelf`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L31f — Terrain: the west-prairie swales are invented alignments
**Decision:** the two west-prairie swales are drawn on invented lines with shallow invented depths, tagged `conjectural`.
**Why:** the dossier says the wet prairie carried slough swales. It does not say where they ran in this box. A swale has to be somewhere to be visible at all, so two were drawn where they plausibly express the described relief without exceeding the project's flatness rule.
**Consequence:** a visitor sees channels in the prairie that stand for a real kind of landform and not for attested individual ones. Their existence is argued; their exact alignment is ours.
**How to resolve:** any map, survey or description locating specific swales in the west prairie.
**Covers:** `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.swales.west_prairie_swale_a`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.swales.west_prairie_swale_b`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L31g — Terrain: the plain is roughened by synthetic micro-relief
**Decision:** land above the waterline carries two octaves of value noise at **±0.10 ft**, faded out across the bank face, and the whole block is tagged `conjectural`.
**Why:** the sources describe this ground as dead flat and a perfectly numerical plane reads as a rendering error when walked on. The noise is there for motion parallax and legibility, not because any source measured hummocks at these wavelengths.
**Consequence:** the visitor sees a surface that reads as ground rather than as a spreadsheet, but the small undulations are not evidence. They are a rendering texture declared as such.
**How to resolve:** it does not resolve into evidence; it would only go away if a different rendering strategy made a perfectly flat plain read correctly.
**Covers:** `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.micro_relief`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L32 — The sward is drawn at a density that hides the ground, not at a stem count
**Decision:** the near field plants roughly **7.3 tufts per square metre**, each tuft a dozen
blades, and that number is a rendering constant in `renderers/web/js/flora.js` (`TUNE.near`).
It is not derived from any record.
**Why:** the flora records give **cover fractions** for the matrix grasses — cordgrass 40-55 %
of the ground in wet prairie, bluejoint 15-25 % — and no source anywhere gives shoots per
square metre for the 1835 lake plain. A real tallgrass sward carries hundreds of shoots to the
square metre; drawing that is not affordable in a browser, so a tuft instance stands for a
*bundle* of shoots rather than for a plant. The records therefore set the MIX — which species,
in what proportion, at what July height, in what greens, in flower or not — and this constant
sets how much geometry is spent realising it. It was tuned against the one thing a photograph
can settle: at standing eye height, in the reference images of surviving Illinois tallgrass in
mid-July, the ground is not visible at all.
**Consequence:** the count of plants on screen is not a measurement and must never be read as
one. A reader counting cordgrass clumps per square metre in this walkthrough is counting a
rendering budget. Cover fractions, heights and phenology *are* the record and can be read.
Two smaller companions to the same admission: only about one tuft in six of a flowering matrix
grass carries a spike, because a bundle of shoots is not a plant and a culm on every bundle
gave the wet prairie the look of a wheat field; and the dead-thatch tint is applied to 7 % of
tufts, a proportion nobody recorded, kept small because a straw-coloured sward is the October
negative control rather than July.
**How to resolve:** it does not resolve into evidence. It could be replaced by a stem-density
model if a modern remnant survey of a comparable community is adopted as a proxy and recorded
as such.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.
**Revised:** 2026-08-13 — the sentence above saying the records set the MIX and this constant
sets the density was true of the renderer and false of the records. Every zone record also
authors `cover.matrix_fraction`, how much of the ground its own matrix covers — 1.00 in wet
prairie, 0.60 on the sand prairie, 0.45 in the settled town and on the shaded riverbank, 0.35
on the lakeshore — with a `bare_soil_fraction` beside it, and `tools/validate.py` has gated
both since the zone records were written. Nothing read either one: all ten communities were
planted at the single density tuned on closed wet prairie, so a town record stating that
45 % of its ground is bare was drawn with the ground covered. That fraction is now the
probability that a lattice slot carries a plant, which means **the density ratio between two
communities is the record's and is no longer a liberty**. What remains one is exactly what
this entry was always about: the absolute figure, and the choice that full recorded cover
saturates the lattice at 7.3 tufts per square metre. A community recording full cover is drawn
exactly as it was before this revision, and no community can ask for more.

### L33 — Beyond about ten metres the prairie is a canopy surface, not plants
**Decision:** vegetation is drawn as individual geometry only within about 27 m of the
visitor. Beyond that the sward is a single sheet at the height of the community's own canopy —
coloured by the zone under it, holed where the records say water — carried out to the edge of
the modelled ground.
**Why:** from an eye height of 1.68 m, a sight line that reaches the soil 60 m away is 1.6
degrees below the horizon; everything from 45 m to the horizon occupies about two degrees of a
fifty-degree frame. Nothing drawn out there can be resolved as a plant, and everything drawn
out there is paid for across the whole plain. The sheet is not a claim that the far prairie is
smooth: it is the top of the sward, which is what a standing observer can actually see of it.
**Consequence:** the far field carries no species. It is coloured from the mean July foliage of
the zone's graminoids and stands at their mean height, so a community change shows as a change
of green and of level and never as a change of plant. The confidence view marks the whole sheet
`inferred`, which is the honest grade for a surface nobody surveyed, but it cannot grade the
species mix underneath it because it is not drawing one. There is also a visible seam in
principle where the sheet begins; it is ragged and it sits behind the drawn plants, but a
visitor who looks for it on flat ground will find it.
**How to resolve:** more geometry, or an impostor scheme that carries species identity into
the far field.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L34 — The sky is corrected toward one photograph, and only near the horizon
**Decision:** the sky is Preetham's model as the vendored `Sky.js` implements it, with one
fitted correction applied inside its fragment shader (`HORIZON_RESTORE` in
`renderers/web/js/world.js`): red and green are attenuated as the sight line approaches the
horizon, blue is untouched, and the effect dies out above about 25°. The three constants that
shape it were solved by least squares against **one photograph** — the July reference in
`bar/`, sampled at ten elevations from 16° down to 0.5°.
**Why:** the model has a genuine defect at the horizon and it is not a matter of taste.
`Sky.js` builds its in-scatter with a `(1 - Fex)` extinction term, and along a horizon ray the
model's own optical path runs ~26× the zenith path at 1° up. `Fex` has gone to zero in all
three channels there, so `1 - Fex` is (1,1,1) and the only wavelength-dependent factor in the
in-scatter is gone. What remains is the ratio of the two phase functions, which is nearly
achromatic — 0.816 : 0.919 : 1.000 for this scene at 1°. The model therefore renders a **white**
horizon: sRGB (181,191,195) at saturation 0.072, where the photograph reads (136,163,192) at
0.288. The error is not a shortage of blue — our blue was 195 against its 191 — it is red +45
and green +28 that a real horizon does not carry. So the correction restores channel dependence
the saturated term threw away, rather than adding a colour the sky did not have.
**Consequence:** the sky above the horizon is no longer purely a physical model's output. It is
a physical model plus an empirical fit, and the fit's authority is the authority of a single
photograph taken on one afternoon at one place. Two specific limits follow. First, it is
**azimuth-blind**: the defect is the same in every direction but the model's horizon
*brightness* is not, and the reference photograph looks within 19° of the sun. Subtracting the
same fraction of red and green from the anti-sun sky leaves it bluer and darker than a
photograph would be — measured at 1° above the north horizon, (104,132,166): the hue is right
(B−R +62 against the bar's +55, where before the correction it was +17) but the luminance is
128 against 160. The render brackets the photograph rather than sitting on it, and it now
brackets from the blue side instead of the grey side. Second, between about 8° and 12° of
elevation the sky is still 15–20 units short of the reference in B−R; that residual is tone-map
compression in the blue channel and was deliberately left alone.
**How to resolve:** an azimuth term, which needs a second **verified** July photograph shot away
from the sun to fit against. There is not one in `bar/`, and deriving the anti-sun sky from the
solar one would be invention of exactly the kind this project refuses. Until then the honest
statement is the one above: correct toward the sun, bracketing away from it.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L35 — The far timber is exempted from the air that hides everything else
**Decision:** the horizon timber band runs the scene's own haze law by hand against each
body's real distance, but caps it: `HAZE_MAX = 0.82` in `renderers/web/js/trees.js`. Every
other distant thing in the scene is hazed by the shared fog, which is deliberately total by
1500 m. The timber alone is not allowed to disappear.
**Why:** two commitments in this repo point opposite ways and one of them had to give. **L17**
leans on total extinction at 1500 m to hide a radial ground skirt that nothing is claimed
about — if the air did not close, the skirt's edge would be visible and would look like
landform. But the timber dossier § 1.6 is a table of real timber bodies at **three, four and
six miles**, explicitly headed "for distant LOD / horizon silhouettes", and total extinction at
1500 m erases every one of them. Deleting them to satisfy the fog would be erasing evidence to
protect a convenience. The cap keeps them visible at a contrast that never exceeds what the
scene's air already allows anything else at about 1.2 km, so it buys the dossier's timber back
without letting the band claim more clarity than the atmosphere elsewhere permits.
**Consequence:** distance in this scene is not governed by one law. Ground, water and sward
obey the fog; the timber band obeys the fog up to 82 % and then stops. A visitor cannot see
this. Three things follow, and the third is this entry correcting itself.

First, the further bodies are **compressed**: `hazeAt` reaches the cap at about 1.15 km, so
everything from there out to the furthest body at 9.7 km renders at one identical value. Their
relative distance is not readable, and the band is *evidence that timber stood out there*, not
a measurement of how far.

Second — **and this entry got this wrong once already, so the retraction is worth keeping.** An
earlier revision said the cap had become load-bearing tonally: that since the haze colour was
retargeted, a fully-hazed surface displayed *brighter* than the sky behind it (L 170.1 against
L 161.7), leaving this cap as the only thing keeping the band dark. That was a real measurement
of an unreal thing. In the vendored three r185 the fragment order is `opaque → tonemapping →
colorspace → fog`, and the fog colour is uploaded through `getUnlitUniformColorSpace()`, so the
scene's fog is a straight lerp toward the literal hex **in display space, after the tone
curve**. A fully-fogged surface therefore renders sRGB (136, 163, 192) — L **159.4**, four
levels *below* the horizon sky, which is exactly what airlight should do. The L 170.1 figure
came from `trees.js` running the haze colour through ACES a second time to derive its band
colour, which is the answer to a question the renderer never asks. There was no atmospheric
inconsistency. There was a colour-management error in one file, and this register briefly wrote
it up as physics.

What survives is smaller and still true: because `trees.js` aims its band at (152, 175, 195)
while the ground it stands on converges to (136, 163, 192), the two are **16 red and 12 green
apart** with the band `toneMapped: false, fog: false` so nothing downstream reconciles them.
The far timber and the far ground are lit by two different laws and meet at the horizon.

**Revised 2026-08-13 — that last paragraph is now history rather than state.** The ACES step is
out of `hazeDisplayLinear()`; the band decodes `HORIZON_HAZE` once, exactly as the fog uniform
does, and both ends report **#88a3c0**. The chroma break at the horizon is closed and the gate
compares the band's own hazed end against `scene.fog.color` rather than against a hex written
down in either file, so retargeting the atmosphere cannot silently reopen it. One consequence
of the old error deserves recording because this entry twice wrote up its symptom as physics:
the band's far end was displaying at **L 170 against a horizon sky of L 162** — a *pale* band,
brighter than the sky behind it, which is what a distant treeline never is. It is L 159 now.
**The cap this entry exists to confess is untouched at 0.82**, and so is the compression it
buys: the argument for it is still EVIDENCE and nothing else.

**Also revised: the third point's measurement is half answered.** The band was additionally
being *deleted* rather than merely dim — the crown/gap modulation cuts a bearing to as little
as 2 % of its height to open sky through a stand, which is texture at four hundred metres and
a deletion on a six-mile body whose whole silhouette is one or two pixels. Measured at the
spawn station: 30 of 280 bearings on a phone and 14 of 281 on a desktop were drawn under one
pixel, the worst at 0.18 px. `renderers/web/js/trees.js` now floors the modulated result at one
pixel of the live viewport and the count is 280/280 and 281/281. **The 31 %-of-columns figure
in this entry is a photographic detection measure and has NOT been re-measured** — it was taken
with a shot harness that is not in the release gate, and this entry has already been burned
once by asserting a visual outcome it did not check. What can be said is that the geometry it
was measuring is no longer being thrown away, and that the band is now darker than its sky
rather than paler.

Third — **this entry asserted a visual outcome and the assertion was false.** It first said a
visitor "would have no reason to suspect it — the band simply reads as far-off woods." Measured
in the delivered frame, the band covers **0.9 %** of its own detection window at Weber **0.026**,
and only **31 % of horizon columns carry any timber at all** — 3.6 % across the central
two-thirds — against 100 % of columns in the reference photograph. It does not read as far-off
woods, and it does not read as a pale ridge either. It mostly does not read. Both sides of the
capping choice sit below the visibility threshold, so the liberty this entry exists to confess
is currently invisible, while the *absence* it was meant to prevent is what a viewer actually
sees. A liberties register that asserts what a visitor perceives must be checked against a
render, or it becomes a record of intent rather than of effect.
**How to resolve:** an atmosphere that is wavelength- and altitude-dependent rather than a
single exponential would haze a six-mile treeline and a 1400 m skirt differently on physics
instead of by exemption, and would let both L17 and § 1.6 hold at once. Failing that, replacing
the skirt with real terrain to the east removes L17's need for a closed horizon, and the cap can
then be argued on its own merits.

### L36 — The business street is built at an invented size, on purpose
**Decision:** the footprints of the South Water Street and Lake Street commercial buildings —
`peck_store`, `chicago_democrat_office`, `harmon_loomis_store`, `madore_beaubien_house`,
`bates_auction_room`, `jb_beaubien_homestead`, `dole_warehouse_south`,
`carpenter_south_water_store`, `chicago_american_office`, `frederick_thomas_shop`,
`old_bank_building` and `pruyne_kimball_drugstore` — are
invented polygons tagged `conjectural`, citing no source. Several of their **storey counts** are
invented too, and one of them, Frederick Thomas's shop, has an invented **position** as well.
**THE FUNCTION CLAUSE OF THIS LIBERTY IS RESOLVED, 2026-08-29 (T-0263), AND IS THE FIRST PIECE
OF IT TO GO.** Thomas's trade was invented here — 'shop', the weakest word that fits a street of
stores — precisely because nothing said what he sold. The *Chicago American* now does, in his
own heading: *"FREDERIC[K] THOMA[S], D[r]ug[gi]st and Apothec[ary], W[at]er Street"*
(1835-07-04, page 4 column 5, claim `chicago_american_1835_07_04#c005`), with two earlier
printings of the same advertisement on 8 and 13 June. So `frederick_thomas_shop.function` is
`drug_store` at `attested` and no longer sits under this entry. **Its position does, unchanged
and unimproved:** the paper's own anchors are the drawbridge and the American office, which are
the two this record was already derived from, so the reading corroborates the derivation and
adds nothing to it, and the street it would settle is cut to `W[ater?]` with the
transcription's own question mark.
**Why:** the honest alternative was to leave the business street empty, and that is the worse
lie. This town's trade was its whole reason to exist — a county seat of some three thousand
people, 250 vessel arrivals in 1835 — and until now the model held eight buildings of which not
one was a store. What the sources give for these buildings is a name, a trade and usually a
street corner: Andreas records that Peck kept a two-storey frame store at South Water and
LaSalle, and the *Chicago Democrat* of 26 November 1833 states its own address in its own
imprint. **None of them gives a dimension.** No period map in this project shows a building
footprint, which is verified for both 1834 sheets. So a footprint here is a guess by
construction, and the only question was whether to make it visibly or by omission.
One real constraint does apply and is used: **South Water lots are 55 ft wide**, which caps the
frontages rather than fixing them.
**Consequence:** the visitor walks a street whose buildings are the right buildings, in the
right places, at the wrong sizes. Turn the confidence view on and the whole row dithers, which
is the correct answer and an unusually honest picture of what this project knows about
commercial Chicago: **who** and **where**, almost never **how big**. Do not measure anything
off this street. The distance between two of these buildings is the distance between two
attested corners, which is real; the buildings spanning it are not.
**How to resolve:** a dimension for any single one of them upgrades that one and nothing else.
The most likely source is the *Chicago Democrat* itself — an advertiser describing his own
premises, or a to-let notice giving a size. **Seventy-three issues of the *Democrat* and
thirteen of the *American* are now read (T-0258–T-0261, T-0326), and not one of the advertisers
on this street states a dimension of his own premises** — they state a trade, a corner and a
stock list, which is what this entry always said the sources give. The route left is a to-let
or an insurance notice in an issue still unread, or the page images.
**Covers:** `peck_store.footprint`, `chicago_democrat_office.footprint`, `harmon_loomis_store.footprint`, `madore_beaubien_house.footprint`, `bates_auction_room.footprint`, `jb_beaubien_homestead.footprint`, `dole_warehouse_south.footprint`, `carpenter_south_water_store.footprint`, `chicago_american_office.footprint`, `frederick_thomas_shop.footprint`, `old_bank_building.footprint`, `old_bank_building.position`, `pruyne_kimball_drugstore.footprint`, `pruyne_kimball_drugstore.position`, `pruyne_kimball_drugstore.form.stories`, `old_bank_building.form.stories`, `chicago_american_office.form.stories`, `dole_warehouse_south.form.stories`, `frederick_thomas_shop.form.stories`, `frederick_thomas_shop.position`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.

### L37 — A shop placed by the phrase "two doors from"
**Decision:** `frederick_thomas_shop` stands on South Water Street with its position, its
function, its storey count and its footprint all tagged `conjectural`. It is the least-evidenced
building in the model.
**Why:** everything this project knows about it is an 1835 advertisement placing it "two doors
from the American office" — and the American office is itself only located "near the
draw-bridge". So the shop is positioned relative to a building that is positioned relative to a
bridge. Each step is attested and the compounded result is a guess: "two doors" assumes a lot
width and a continuous frontage, neither of which is recorded for that block. Its trade is not
stated either, so even what the building was *for* is inferred from the fact that a man
advertised from it.
**Consequence:** this record exists to make a point the empty-lot alternative cannot. The
business street was continuous — shops stood two doors from other shops — and a model that
draws only the buildings whose corners are documented shows a row of isolated structures with
gaps between them that never existed. That gap is a false statement too, and a less visible one.
**How to resolve:** an advertisement giving a block, or a lot number in a deed.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.


### L39 — Chicago's first movable bridge, with the moving part left out
**Decision:** `dearborn_street_drawbridge` is built as a fixed timber crossing. Its **draw span**
and its **gallows frames** are recorded on the record and declared `geometry: absent`; its
overall length is declared `simplified`; its width, its pier count and its pier kind are
`conjectural`; and like both branch bridges it does not reach the ground at either end.
**Why:** the draw is the entire historical point of this structure — it is the first movable
bridge in Chicago, built 1834, and what a contemporary would have told you about it is that it
opened. What the sources give is that it was "about 300 feet" long with a "**60 foot**" opening,
of "gallows pattern", with frames at either end, and hoisted. That is enough to know a draw
existed and roughly how wide; it is not enough to build the mechanism. Nothing describes how the
leaves were framed, what carried the hoist, where the windlass or capstan stood, or whether the
opening was one leaf or two. Modelling it would mean designing a machine and attributing it to
1834 Chicago.
**A correction is embedded here and worth stating**, because it is how the omission got its
shape: this project briefly held that the bridge was double-leaf and chain-hoisted. Neither is
attested. Both descriptions were lifted from the same web page's account of the **1890s–1963
bascule bridges** on the same street, sixty years later. The words "double-leaf" and "leaves"
occur on that page only there. Had the mechanism been modelled from that reading, the model
would have carried a late-Victorian bascule in an 1834 scene, which is exactly the failure mode
this file exists to catch.
**Consequence:** a visitor sees a long low timber bridge and no reason to think it was ever
anything else. The one fact that made this structure remarkable in its own town is the fact the
model does not show. The 60-foot gap in the deck is not drawn either, so the crossing reads as
continuous when it was not.
**Evidence since, 2026-08-11:** the frames are **built**. `bridge_timber` grew a draw — the
sixty-foot opening now clears four invented supports out of itself and stations two gallows
frames at its ends — on the argument that a dithered translucent frame says "this shape is ours"
in a way no footnote can, while an absent one tells a visitor the town's one piece of
engineering was a plain causeway. What is still missing is the *mechanism*: no leaf, no hinge,
no tackle. The draw is built **closed**, which is the only state agnostic between the three
arrangements the sources permit. `gallows_height_m` is conjectural and carries the whole frame's
confidence, so the most conspicuous object on the crossing is the one the confidence view
dithers hardest.
**Evidence since, 2026-08-21: the engraving this entry asked for arrived, and the tackle is
built.** "How to resolve" below names *an engraving* as one of the three things that would
settle the hoist. The owner's brief of 2026-08-18 supplies two of them, and both draw chains
falling from the frames to the draw. `form.draw_lifting_gear` has moved from `false` /
`geometry: record_only` to `chain_hoist` at `inferred`, and the frames' bracing, the closed
draw's leaf timber and the deck's railing came with it — all of that is **L163**, which carries
the new inventions and the caveat that a retrospective plate is exactly the vector by which a
later bridge's mechanism reached every modern retelling of this one. **One token has therefore
left the `Covers:` list below — `dearborn_street_drawbridge.draw_1834.form.draw_lifting_gear` —
and it is named here so the removal is on the record rather than silent.** The other six still
stand: the footprint, the frames' height, the simplified overall length, the pier count, the
pier kind and the width are as invented as they were. The entry stays out of the Resolved
section for that reason; what was resolved is one line of it, not the liberty.
**How to resolve:** any description of the draw's framing or its hoist — a repair contract, a
council order, an engraving. The bridge was repaired in 1835, so a repair record is the most
likely thing to exist. A CONTEMPORARY view, as against the retrospective plates L163 works
from, would settle what those plates only suggest.
**Covers:** `dearborn_street_drawbridge.draw_1834.footprint`, `dearborn_street_drawbridge.draw_1834.form.gallows_height_m`, `dearborn_street_drawbridge.draw_1834.form.overall_length_m`, `dearborn_street_drawbridge.draw_1834.form.pier_count`, `dearborn_street_drawbridge.draw_1834.form.pier_kind`, `dearborn_street_drawbridge.draw_1834.form.width_m`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-10.
**Evidence since, 2026-08-19:** the ground_contact token is withdrawn. T-0046's approach
earthworks (L147) raise Dearborn Street to the deck at both ends and the record no longer
declares `approach_not_modelled`. Everything this entry says about the draw, the mechanism and
the omitted opening is untouched.

### L36a — Thomas Church's store: a building placed by a street and one sentence
**Decision:** `thomas_church_store` stands on Lake Street with its **position** and its
**footprint** tagged `conjectural`, and it is declared `outside_modelled_ground`.
**Why:** the entire evidence is one sentence in an uncredited editorial addendum on a
chicagology map-gallery page — *"The first store building on Lake Street, a two-story frame
structure, was built by Thomas Church."* That gives a **form** and a **street**, and no year,
block, lot, corner or dimension. The page's surrounding sentences run 1833, 1835, 1837, which
invites a date the sentence does not give; the project's own source record for that page grades
the addendum the weakest text in its set and says it must never outrank Andreas. So the storey
count and the material are documented and everything spatial is invention: the block, the side
of the street and the point along it were chosen to avoid the Lake Street buildings this dataset
knows the corners of and has not yet modelled — the Tremont House, the Mansion House, the
Exchange Coffee House, First Presbyterian, St Mary's. **Placing a record where there is room is
a rendering decision, not a finding**, and it is written on the record so a visitor can recover
it. The 55 ft lot cap that constrains the South Water frontages is a South Water figure and is
not evidence about Lake Street, so no cap is claimed here.
**Consequence:** the along-street uncertainty is the whole of Lake Street inside the town,
roughly 700 m, and the side of the street is a coin toss. The building is right; the lot is
ours. It also stands beyond the modelled terrain box, on the radial skirt of L17, for the same
reason as every record L40 covers.
**How to resolve:** Andreas at page-image level for any mention of Thomas Church, which would
outrank the addendum on this project's own grading; or a *Chicago Democrat* advertisement giving
Church's address. A date is the more urgent half — **if the store is 1835 work it may not have
stood on 1835-07-01, and the record then belongs in `data/exclusions.json` rather than in the
scene.**
**Covers:** `thomas_church_store.frame_1834.footprint`, `thomas_church_store.frame_1834.position`.
**Evidence since, 2026-08-11:** the ground_contact token is withdrawn. This entry said the
store stood beyond the modelled box on L17's radial skirt; S2e has since built the ground
under it. The invented block, side of street and point along it are untouched.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L47 — Fort Dearborn's stockade: the plan is evidence and the wall is not
**Decision:** the fort's picket line is built at an invented height, out of invented posts, with
an invented gate opening and invented corner works. Its **plan** — a square, two gates north and
south, bastions at the north-west and south-east angles, a block-house at the south-west — is
`documented` or `inferred` from three sources that agree; its **fabric** is entirely ours.
**Why:** the whole of the physical description this project could find is one adjective. Juliette
Kinzie, living inside it in 1831: *"The fort was inclosed by high pickets, with bastions at the
alternate angles. Large gates opened to the north and south."* Andreas adds "a square stockade"
and the two gates. The 1830 Harrison plan draws the outline. **Nobody wrote down how high the
pickets were, how wide they were, how close they stood, how wide the gates opened or how far the
bastions projected**, and Quaife — who wrote the standing monograph on this fort and had the War
Department files — gives no dimension of the 1816 work anywhere. So twelve feet, a ten-inch face,
a hand's gap, a twelve-foot gate and a seven-metre bastion are all this project's arithmetic
wearing plausible numbers.
**The one that matters most is the height.** A stockade's height is what a visitor reads the
building by: at three metres it is a compound, at four it is a fort. The confidence view dithers
it, which is exactly right and is the only thing standing between a viewer and a number we
invented from an adjective.
**Consequence:** the fort's silhouette — the thing anyone would photograph — is ours. So is the
gap between the posts, which decides whether you can see through the wall.
**How to resolve:** any quartermaster return, repair estimate or engineer's report for the post
between 1816 and 1836. A picket count or a quantity of timber would settle the height and the
spacing together.
**Covers:** `fort_dearborn_palisade.picket_1816.form.picket_height_m`, `fort_dearborn_palisade.picket_1816.form.picket_width_m`, `fort_dearborn_palisade.picket_1816.form.picket_spacing_m`, `fort_dearborn_palisade.picket_1816.form.gate_width_m`, `fort_dearborn_palisade.picket_1816.form.bastion_length_m`, `fort_dearborn_palisade.picket_1816.form.bastion_projection_m`, `fort_dearborn_palisade.picket_1816.form.posterns`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.
**Evidence since, 2026-08-28 (T-0185):** the gap between the posts — the part of this entry
that "decides whether you can see through the wall" — was challenged by the one picture of the
fort, and holds. `p4_0` resolves separate posts at a 10 px rhythm on a 42.9 px curtain, 0.23 of
the wall's height per post against this record's 0.081, and nothing had ever tested whether that
was a reading of the fort or of the lithograph. It is of the lithograph: at the plate's own scale
of 11.6 px per metre this wall's rhythm is 2.78 px of post and **0.70 px of gap**, and the
narrowest gap the plate holds anywhere on that curtain is 2 px. It could not have drawn this wall
whatever the fort was made of, so its coarser pitch is the floor of the medium — and 0.23 of a
3.7 m wall is an 0.86 m post, which is not a picket. **Nothing is upgraded and nothing moved.**
Both figures stay `reconstructed` and this liberty stands exactly as written; what is new is that
the disagreement is now measured and recorded, so the next run reads it rather than re-opening it.
`tools/measure_picket_plate.py` prints both sides.

### L42 — The fort's buildings stand at heights, under roofs and behind stacks nobody recorded
**Decision:** across the six modelled buildings inside Fort Dearborn, the **storey counts** of
the officers' quarters and the barracks, the **wall heights** of the block-house, the magazine,
the artillery house and the root house, every **roof form and pitch** that is not a plain gable
by type, the block-house's **jetty**, its **loopholes** and its **stack**, and the deliberate
**absence of galleries** on the two long ranges are all invention.
**Why:** two witnesses walked round the inside of this fort and wrote down what stood where —
Gurdon Hubbard in 1827 and the key to the 1855 photograph — and between them they give one
building's dimensions, one building's material twice, and nothing at all about height, roof or
chimney for anything. The 1830 plan is a plan: it has no third dimension. What fills the gap here
is building type, which is a real argument and not evidence: a magazine has no windows, a
block-house has a jettied upper storey and loopholes because that is what the word means, and a
barracks for two companies does not fit on one floor of a ninety-foot range.
**The galleries are the subtlest of these and they are a decision, not an omission.** Captain
Whistler's 1808 index for the FIRST fort says its barracks were *"two storeys high with shingled
Roofs and Galliaries fronting the parade"*. Nothing says the 1816 fort's ranges had them, and
John H. Kinzie says the two forts were "differently constructed". So the ranges are built with
plain fronts, which renders as a claim — a visitor sees flat elevations facing the parade — made
because the evidence for the alternative belongs to a building that burned in 1812.
**Consequence:** the fort's massing is ours. Roof heights set the skyline of the whole complex,
and a two-storey barracks against a one-storey one changes the scene from across the river.
**How to resolve:** the same records that would settle the stockade — returns, repair estimates,
the Chicago Democrat's building notices — or any measured elevation of the fort before 1856.
**Covers:** `fort_dearborn_officers_quarters.log_1816.form.stories`, `fort_dearborn_officers_quarters.log_1816.form.gallery`, `fort_dearborn_barracks.log_1816.form.stories`, `fort_dearborn_barracks.log_1816.form.gallery`, `fort_dearborn_blockhouse.log_1816.form.wall_height_m`, `fort_dearborn_blockhouse.log_1816.form.upper_overhang_m`, `fort_dearborn_blockhouse.log_1816.form.loopholes`, `fort_dearborn_blockhouse.log_1816.form.roof_type`, `fort_dearborn_blockhouse.log_1816.form.roof_pitch_deg`, `fort_dearborn_blockhouse.log_1816.form.chimneys`, `fort_dearborn_magazine.brick_1816.form.wall_height_m`, `fort_dearborn_magazine.brick_1816.form.roof_type`, `fort_dearborn_artillery_house.log_1816.form.construction`, `fort_dearborn_artillery_house.log_1816.form.stories`, `fort_dearborn_artillery_house.log_1816.form.wall_height_m`, `fort_dearborn_artillery_house.log_1816.form.roof_type`, `fort_dearborn_artillery_house.log_1816.form.roof_pitch_deg`, `fort_dearborn_root_house.cellar_1816.form.wall_height_m`, `fort_dearborn_root_house.cellar_1816.form.roof_type`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L43 — Three things inside and beside the fort are placed by a sentence, a side, or nothing
**Decision:** the **magazine's outline**, the **artillery house's outline and position**, and the
**root house's outline and position** are invented. All three are built anyway.
**Why:** they are three different grades of thin and it is worth separating them, because the
model shows all three the same way. The **magazine** has the best-attested position in the fort —
Hubbard, 1827: *"the magazine, of brick, was situated about half way between the west end of the
guard and block-houses"* — and the 1830 plan does not draw it, so its size is a powder magazine
for a two-company post and nothing more. The **artillery house** is named once, by Robert Fergus,
describing the fort in **1850**, on a side of the parade the 1830 plan has already filled with
the barracks; its position is the one part of that side the plan leaves empty and its size fits
the gap. The **root house** rests on one sentence of Juliette Kinzie's putting the garrison's
root-houses on the river bank west of the fort in 1831, with no number, no size and no point on
that bank — and her plural is not modelled either, because a count invented on top of a position
invented is two inventions.
**Consequence:** a visitor walking the fort sees three structures whose outlines are ours. The
artillery house is the one to distrust most: it is placed inside a documented enclosure on the
authority of a description written fifteen years after the army left.
**How to resolve:** an inventory, a plan of the fort later than 1830, or the Chicago Democrat's
notices. Any of the three would move at least one of these to `inferred`.
**Covers:** `fort_dearborn_magazine.brick_1816.footprint`, `fort_dearborn_artillery_house.log_1816.footprint`, `fort_dearborn_artillery_house.log_1816.position`, `fort_dearborn_root_house.cellar_1816.footprint`, `fort_dearborn_root_house.cellar_1816.position`.

### L44 — The 1832 lighthouse: one documented number and an invented tower
**Decision:** `chicago_lighthouse_1832` is built as a tapering twelve-sided masonry shaft with a
gallery and a lantern, standing about 65 m north-west of the fort. Its **height** is documented
and its **lantern** is documented; its **footprint**, its **position**, its **taper**, its cap
and its finish are ours.
**Why:** Andreas gives the whole of it in one sentence — *"Another tower, forty feet high, was
begun and completed by Mr. Jackson in 1832. It boasted of a fourteen-inch reflector."* — and the
lighthousefriends page adds four fourteen-inch reflectors in a bird-cage lantern room. **That is
all.** No diameter, no wall thickness, no plan, no material and no distance from the fort.
**A correction is embedded here, and it is the reason this entry exists.** This project's own
dossier reads the 1832 tower as *"forty feet high; conical stone/masonry"* and tags it
`[DOC]`, and `data/exclusions.json` calls it "the 1832 conical masonry tower" on Andreas's
authority. Neither "conical" nor "masonry" is in Andreas's sentence or on the lighthousefriends
page. The only fabric detail either source carries — *"The walls were three feet thick"* and a
height of fifty feet — belongs to the **first** tower, the one that collapsed unfinished on 30
October 1831. So the shape everybody repeats about this lighthouse is a description of a building
that fell down. The record grades the material `inferred` on a real argument (Samuel Jackson
built both towers under the same appropriation on the same site, and the first was masonry) and
the shape `conjectural`, and the taper this archetype builds is admitted here.
**Consequence:** the most distinctive small object at the river mouth is a shape we chose. Its
position is worse: adjacency to the fort is documented three ways and the offset is a bearing and
a distance we picked.
**How to resolve:** the Light-House Board's annual reports, a keeper's return, or any of the
several 1840s and 1850s views of the fort — the tower stands in the 1850 daguerreotype and the
1855 photograph, and a measured reading of either would settle the shape at once.

### L45 — The garrison garden: a fence read from a drawing convention, and a planting not drawn
**Decision:** `fort_dearborn_garrison_garden` is built as a worm rail fence round a square of
about 77 m. The fence's **height, its courses, its panel length and its zigzag** are invented,
and the **planting inside it is documented and not built at all**.
**Why:** the 1830 Harrison plan draws this plot and labels it "Garden for the Garrison", and it
draws two of its sides as a continuous zigzag. A zigzag boundary on a period American survey is
the convention for a worm — snake — rail fence, so that is what is built; but the convention is
the reading and the sheet never says "fence", which is why `wall_kind` is `inferred` and every
dimension of the fence is `conjectural`. The planting is the opposite case and the sharper one:
Juliette Kinzie says the company gardens were *"well filled with currant-bushes and young
fruit-trees"*, which is `documented`, and **nothing of it is modelled**, because currant bushes
and fruit trees are flora and `data/flora/` has no cultivated zone and no garden species. So the
record carries a documented chip over an empty rectangle of ground.
**A guard belongs here too.** The garden usually quoted in accounts of this fort — *"The ground
on the south side was enclosed and cultivated as a garden"* — is from a passage that ends *"Such
was the old Fort previous to 1812"*. It is the FIRST fort's garden and this record does not rest
on it.
**Consequence:** the reservation reads as fenced, empty ground. The single most evocative
detail anyone recorded about this place — fruit trees in a garrison garden on the Chicago
prairie — is in the data and invisible in the model.
**How to resolve:** a cultivated-ground zone in `data/flora/`, which is a flora parcel rather
than a structure one; the species are already named by the source.
**Covers:** `fort_dearborn_garrison_garden.fence_1816.form.fence_height_m`, `fort_dearborn_garrison_garden.fence_1816.form.rail_courses`, `fort_dearborn_garrison_garden.fence_1816.form.panel_length_m`, `fort_dearborn_garrison_garden.fence_1816.form.panel_offset_m`, `fort_dearborn_garrison_garden.fence_1816.form.planting`.

### L41 — The harbour piers are a measured line, an interpolated length and an invented width
**Decision:** `north_pier` and `south_pier` are drawn as timber crib lines 900 ft and 400 ft
long and **25 ft wide**. The bearing and the landward root of both are measured off Wright
1834; the length of both is an **interpolation between two year-end figures**, recorded
`inferred` on `form.length_m`; the width of both is **the archetype's own constant**, recorded
`conjectural`, and it carries the footprint down with it.
**Why:** the sheet that gives the line cannot give the width. Wright 1834 draws the harbour as
two red pier lines with HARBOR lettered between them, and read through this project's own
fitted affine the two run at 103.4 and 103.5 degrees from grid north and stand 64.2 m apart —
against a documented 200 ft entrance, which is 61.0 m, a four-per-cent agreement from evidence
that shares no input. That is a good measurement of a **line**. But the sheet is drawn at about
1:7,200, where a 25-ft crib is 0.13 mm of paper and about a fifth of the width of the pen that
drew the pier: the red bands are line weight and carry no thickness at all, so measuring one
would be measuring the draughtsman's nib. No text reached states a width either. 25 ft is this
archetype's number, kept as a single constant in `pier_crib_params.DEFAULT_WIDTH_M` so that
both piers inherit **one** invention a reader can find in one place rather than two that could
drift apart.
**The length is a different kind of not-knowing and is graded differently.** No source gives a
length for any date inside the 1835 season; what exist are year-end figures — north 700 ft
(end 1834) to 1,260 ft (end 1835), south 200 ft to 700 ft — and 1 July is placed between them
on a season-weighted rather than a calendar reading, at 900 ft and 400 ft, inside the bands
`docs/research/04-structures-south.md` §3 reaches independently. That is `inferred` with the
arithmetic written out, not `conjectural`, and it is not claimed here. What is claimed is the
**drawn shape**, which is graded by its weaker axis.
**A third invention rides along and is claimed here too:** the cribs are drawn as equal
30-ft modules (`pier_crib_params.CRIB_MODULE_FALLBACK_M`). Nobody recorded a crib length, and a
pier built out over several seasons in fact ends where a season ended, not on an even module.
**Consequence:** a visitor sees two piers of a definite length and a definite width, and only
their direction and their starting point are evidence. The confidence view renders both as
massing, which is right, and cannot say that one of the two axes is much better known than the
other — only this entry can. Nothing should be read off how far out they run.
**How to resolve:** the Chief Engineer's annual report for 1835 or the House Document series
would replace the interpolated length with a figure (`docs/research/01-terrain-hydrology.md`
already names them as the thing to find). For the width, J. D. Graham's 1857 and 1858
hydrographic surveys of the Chicago bar draw the piers in plan at a usable scale, or any
specification or voucher for the crib work.
**Covers:** `north_pier.crib_1835.footprint`, `north_pier.crib_1835.form.width_m`, `south_pier.crib_1835.footprint`, `south_pier.crib_1835.form.width_m`.

### L51 — The north bank is drawn at invented sizes, and the confidence view cannot say so
**Decision:** the footprints of the seven north-bank and Wolf Point structures added on
2026-08-11 — `cobweb_castle`, `blacksmith_shop_state_st`, `miller_tannery`,
`north_side_school_1833`, `steamboat_hotel`, `council_house` and `robinson_caldwell_cabins` —
are invented polygons tagged `conjectural`, citing no source. The North Side school house's
**construction** is invented too.
**Why:** the same argument L36 makes for the business street, one bank north. What these sources
give is a name, a use, a year and usually a street: *Wau-Bun* describes Cobweb Castle's
composition and never its size; Andreas gives the tannery a direction, the school a side of
Clark Street, the smithy a proximity and the hotel a street, and **not one of them gives a
dimension**. No period map in this project draws a building footprint, which is verified for
both 1834 sheets. So a footprint here is a guess by construction and the only question was
whether to make it visibly or by omission. One polygon carries real evidence in its **shape**
and none in its size — Cobweb Castle's centre, two wings and two tails is *Wau-Bun*'s sentence
drawn — and that distinction is stated in its own footprint note.
The school's `construction` is a preference between two readings rather than a derivation: log
keeps it with the older north-bank fabric, and the nearest building anybody dated is frame — the
Methodist meeting house contracted for "a frame building twenty-six by thirty-eight feet" at
North Water and Clark on 30 June 1834, one block away and a year later. Choosing log also chose
the archetype, so if it is wrong the building is wrong in kind.
**Consequence, and it is worse here than on the business street.** `log_dwelling` computes its
wall massing's `_CONFIDENCE` from `stories` and `construction` only — **not from `footprint`** —
so a building whose every dimension is invented renders at the confidence of its storey count.
`miller_tannery` is the clean case: its footprint is a placeholder and the whole building shows
`0.5`, inferred. **Turning the confidence view on does not reveal an invented footprint on any
log building in this dataset.** The `_CONFIDENCE` worked example in docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md says
the footprint should drive it; the archetype does not. Until that is fixed and the town re-baked,
this entry is the only place a visitor can learn it.
**How to resolve:** a dimension for any one of them upgrades that one and nothing else. The
likeliest source is the *Chicago Democrat* and the *Chicago American* — Davis advertised the
Steamboat Hotel in the latter, and hotel advertisements of the period describe premises. The
archetype half is a one-line change plus a re-bake of every log building.
**Covers:** `cobweb_castle.log_1820.footprint`, `blacksmith_shop_state_st.log_1823.footprint`, `miller_tannery.log_1831.footprint`, `north_side_school_1833.log_1833.footprint`, `north_side_school_1833.log_1833.form.construction`, `steamboat_hotel.frame_1835.footprint`, `council_house.log_1834.footprint`, `robinson_caldwell_cabins.log_1831.footprint`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L54 — Cobweb Castle: the one building anybody described, built as a box
**Decision:** the Indian Agency house is modelled as a plain rectangular log mass under a gable
roof. Its attested **plan** — "a centre, two wings, and, strictly speaking, two tails" — is
recorded as `plan_composition`, drawn in the footprint polygon, and declared
`geometry: "absent"`. Its attested **cladding**, "clapboarded part way up", is declared
`geometry: "simplified"`. Its `roof_type` is tagged `conjectural` although a gable is built.
**Why:** this is the best-described building on the north bank and the archetype can express
almost none of it. `log_dwelling` masses the footprint polygon's **bounding box**, so the cross
this record draws — a centre projecting one metre forward of two flanking wings, with two tails
running back from the rear — comes out as a 13 × 9 m rectangle with the re-entrant corners filled
in. The same limitation L27 records for Miller's L-shaped plan, on the building where it costs
most. The roof follows from it: *Wau-Bun* says the hours were passed "under its **odd-shaped
roof**", which is what a centre with two wings and two tails produces, and one gable is the
opposite of that — so the value is a substitution and is graded as one rather than passed off as
a reading. The clapboarding is a documented finish on a log wall that the archetype paints as
bare hewn log (L22's finding, on a record L22 does not name).
**Consequence:** the visitor walks past a box. Everything a reader would recognise this building
by — the wings, the tails, the comical adjuncts a platted street exposed, the boards taken part
way up the wall — is in the record and not in the model. The confidence view marks the mass
`1.0` because the roof is conjectural, which is right by accident: it is the plan that is
missing, and the tint cannot say which.
**How to resolve:** an archetype that extrudes the polygon rather than its bounding box would
build the plan this record already draws, from data already committed. That is a geometry change
and a re-bake, not a research problem.
**Covers:** `cobweb_castle.log_1820.form.plan_composition`, `cobweb_castle.log_1820.form.cladding`, `cobweb_castle.log_1820.form.roof_type`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L53 — The Steamboat Hotel: a documented hotel with an entirely invented fabric
**Decision:** `steamboat_hotel` is built as a two-storey braced-frame block, 15 × 8 m, unpainted,
gable-roofed, with no gallery — and **every one of those values is tagged `conjectural`**,
including the construction, which is also what chose the archetype.
**Why:** two sources give this house a street, a cross-street, a year and a keeper, and not one
word about its fabric, size, plan, storeys or finish. Andreas: "The Steamboat Hotel, on North
Water Street, near Kinzie, was kept in 1835 by John Davis." That is the whole of it. Frame was
chosen because every Chicago hotel this dataset can date to 1833 or later is frame — the Green
Tree of 1833, the Western of 1834, the Tremont of 1833 — while the log taverns at the forks all
belong to the 1828-31 generation. But this project's own line, set in L18, is that **the ordinary
reading of a type is not evidence about a building**, and nobody described this one. `paint` and
`gallery` are recorded rather than omitted for a reason worth keeping: the archetype's defaults
are white paint and no gallery, so leaving them out would have made both claims silently, and
white paint on an 1835 house is a claim *Wau-Bun* shows was worth remarking on in 1831.
**Consequence:** the whole building renders as dithered massing in the confidence view, which is
the correct answer and an unusually honest one — this is what the project knows about a hotel it
can name, date and staff. **Do not read anything off its elevation.** And note the compounding
risk: if the frame reading is wrong the building is wrong in kind, not in detail, because a log
reading would move it to a different archetype.
**A second admission belongs with it.** The date is inferred, not documented. Both sources say
1835 and neither gives a month; every dated anchor — the 8 June 1835 first issue of the paper
Davis advertised in, the 9 November 1835 change of management — falls **after** the scene date.
The record argues the case on `documented_range` and says that a dated advertisement putting the
opening after 1 July sends it to `data/exclusions.json`.
**How to resolve:** the *Chicago American* and the *Chicago Democrat*. An advertisement would
plausibly settle the fabric, the size and the opening date in one document.
**Covers:** `steamboat_hotel.frame_1835.form.construction`, `steamboat_hotel.frame_1835.form.stories`, `steamboat_hotel.frame_1835.form.wall_height_m`, `steamboat_hotel.frame_1835.form.roof_type`, `steamboat_hotel.frame_1835.form.paint`, `steamboat_hotel.frame_1835.form.gallery`.

### L52 — Two buildings placed inside bands, and two or three cabins built as one
**Decision:** `council_house` and `robinson_caldwell_cabins` carry `conjectural` positions —
points chosen inside stretches a source bounds but does not narrow — and the cabins are built as
**one** cabin where the source counts "two or three".
**Why:** the council house is located by a single sentence in a 1910 newspaper recollection: "on
the north side of the river, **east of the present State street and west of the 'Lake House'**".
That is a 215 m stretch of riverbank, and no other source narrows it, so the along-bank position
is good to about **±110 m** — five times the georeference's own uncertainty and the largest
positional error in this dataset. The cabins are located by *Wau-Bun*'s row order alone — the
tavern, then "near him" the cabins, then "a little remote" the log meeting house — between two
neighbours that are themselves placed from bank geometry, one of which (`walker_meeting_house`)
may be on the wrong bank entirely. The count is the source's own hedge: "two or three log cabins
occupied by Robinson, the Pottowattamie chief, and some of his wife's connexions". Building two
or three would mean inventing the number *Wau-Bun* declined to give, plus their spacing and
arrangement, so the record keeps the words as the value, declares `geometry: "simplified"`, and
builds one.
**Consequence:** for both, the sidecar's flat `uncertainty_m: 20` is wrong by a large factor —
the same understatement L7 records for the Wolf Point three, worse. A visitor sees a council
house standing on a specific spot that no source puts it on, and sees one cabin where at least
two stood. Neither is visible in the confidence view: the tint grades a value, not a place, and
it cannot render a building that should have been two.
**Both records are flagged `review_required: true`** and that is not a liberty, it is the
standing constraint in `AGENTS.md`. The council house is where the assembly of 18 August 1835
formed; the cabins were the homes of Potawatomi people in the year of the removal. This project
models the built environment and asserts nothing about presence, occupancy or events, and the
flag holds the scene short of `released` until someone qualified has read the records.
**How to resolve:** for the council house, any source naming a street, a corner or a lot — the
*Chicago Democrat*'s notices of agency business, or the corrected 1835 Wabansia and Kinzie's
Addition plat. For the cabins, any source that follows them past 1831: the 1833 treaty's
schedules of improvements and claims are the likeliest.

### L55 — The town's three worship buildings wear a dwelling's facade
**Decision:** the First Presbyterian Church, St. Mary's and the Temple Building are all built
with the `frame_dwelling` archetype, which puts the door in the long eaves-front wall and sets
the openings out on a house's bay module. `plan` and `bays` are tagged `conjectural` on all
three.
**Why:** the schema offers an `institutional` archetype and there is no generator behind it, so
a record using it compiles a sidecar pointing at a GLB that does not exist and the building is
invisible. Of the archetypes that do build, `frame_tavern` carries a public house's gallery,
`frame_storefront` carries a shopfront, and `outbuilding` refuses a storey count — leaving
`frame_dwelling`, which is the only one that builds a plain single-range frame box with a gable
roof and nothing else. That is the right MASSING for all three buildings and the wrong FACADE
for all three.
**Consequence:** a visitor sees three plain frame boxes with a domestic front. `plan:
centre_passage` was chosen on each to force a centred door and a symmetrical elevation, which
is the nearest a house's grammar comes to a meeting house's; the archetype's own default,
`hall_parlour`, would have put the church door two thirds of the way along the wall. The bay
counts — five on the Presbyterian church, three on St. Mary's and the Temple Building — are
consequences of that choice and of the frontage, not findings. Nothing describes a window,
a door or an elevation on any of the three.
**A second cost, on St. Mary's only:** a 25 × 35 ft church almost certainly stood **gable-end
to the street**, and this archetype builds an eaves-front range only — the ridge always runs
parallel to the facade — so the 35 ft dimension becomes the Lake Street frontage by
construction. The building is turned ninety degrees from what its proportions imply. The
footprint note says so; the attribute is `inferred` rather than `conjectural` because both
dimensions are attested and only their assignment is not, so this entry claims the facade and
the footprint note carries the orientation.
**How to resolve:** an `institutional` (or `meeting_house`) archetype — a single-cell plan, a
gable-front option, a door in the gable end, a plain bench-lit side elevation — which would
serve all three buildings and any later church. Failing that, any depiction or description of
one of these elevations.
**Covers:** `first_presbyterian_church.frame_1834.form.plan`, `first_presbyterian_church.frame_1834.form.bays`, `st_marys_church.frame_1833.form.plan`, `st_marys_church.frame_1833.form.bays`, `temple_building.frame_1833.form.plan`, `temple_building.frame_1833.form.bays`.

### L56 — Four documented interiors, and no interior is modelled
**Decision:** the pine-board benches seating about 200 and the plastered walls over bare
puncheon floors in the First Presbyterian Church, the rough benches and the table for an altar
in St. Mary's, and the division of Eliza Chappel's log house into a school-room and lodging
quarters are all recorded as `documented` and all declared `geometry: absent`.
**Why:** this project models exteriors. No structure in the dataset has an interior, and these
four are the first records whose best-attested facts are inside the building — which is the
situation the `geometry:` declaration exists for: without it the popup would show the strongest
confidence chip the project has over something a visitor cannot see.
**Consequence:** the three best sentences anybody wrote about these buildings are in the record
and not in the model. It matters more here than for a stable or a sign, because for a meeting
house the interior IS the building: what distinguishes the Presbyterian church from St. Mary's
is not their massing, which is within a few feet of identical, but that one was plastered with
benches for two hundred and the other was unplastered with rough benches and a table.
**One of the four does reach the mesh, indirectly, and that is worth saying:** the Chappel
house's attested division into two rooms is the reason its invented footprint is a two-room
size rather than a single pen. A number a human chose from a sentence is not the sentence
being built.
**How to resolve:** interiors, or a popup that renders the interior description alongside the
elevation. The second is much cheaper and would discharge most of what this entry admits.
**Covers:** `first_presbyterian_church.frame_1834.form.seating`, `first_presbyterian_church.frame_1834.form.interior_finish`, `st_marys_church.frame_1833.form.seating`, `chappel_infant_school.log_1833.form.interior_division`.

### L57 — The Temple Building is sized by arithmetic on its own cost
**Decision:** the Temple Building's footprint is drawn at 30 × 25 ft, tagged `conjectural`,
and derived from the one quantitative fact anybody recorded about it — that it cost about $900.
**Why:** no source gives this building a dimension. It does give a cost, and this dataset now
holds two contemporary buildings whose cost AND area are both attested: the First Presbyterian
Church at $600 for 1,000 sq ft and St. Mary's at $400 for 875 sq ft, i.e. $0.60 and $0.46 per
square foot. Two storeys at the midpoint of that range buys about 1,600 sq ft of floor, so
about 800 per storey; 30 × 25 ft is 750, which at $0.55 gives $825 against the attested $900.
**Consequence:** a derivation with three numbers in it reads as a finding and is not one. Two
things are wrong with it in known directions and neither is corrected, because correcting a
guess with another guess is worse: the cost per square foot of a two-storey building is lower
than a single-storey one's — a second floor is cheap against a roof and a foundation — so the
real building was probably BIGGER than this; and both reference figures rest on the citation
problem set out in the Presbyterian church's research note, where the dossier's row cites
Wikipedia and Andreas together without saying which supplied the dimensions. The 25 ft depth is
additionally borrowed rather than derived: it is the depth of both churches and of the
rectangle four other records in this dataset already use.
**How to resolve:** any dimension at all, from a deed, an insurance entry, a subscription list
or Andreas at page-image level.
**Covers:** `temple_building.frame_1833.footprint`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L58 — Three buildings sized by what they were for
**Decision:** the log jail (20 × 15 ft), Eliza Chappel's log school house (24 × 18 ft) and the
Watkins house on Michigan Street (30 × 20 ft) are drawn at invented footprints, tagged
`conjectural`.
**Why:** no source reached gives any of the three a dimension, a plan or a room count. What
each does supply is a USE, and the sizes are read off that and nothing else: a jail described as
"something more metropolitan ... than the estray pen" and superseded within a few years is a
two-cell log lock-up; a log house "divided into school-room and lodging quarters" holds two
rooms, so it is bigger than a single pen and smaller than a public building; a house a
schoolmaster could take a class in one room of is an ordinary two-room dwelling.
**Consequence:** three buildings stand at three specific sizes that nobody recorded, and the
proportions are as invented as the areas. The repetition across the dataset is deliberate and is
the honest form of the admission — 24 × 18 and 30 × 20 recur here and elsewhere because they are
type sizes, not measurements, and a set of unrelated-looking numbers would hide that.
**How to resolve:** a county order or contract for the jail (which would carry a specification
as well as a size); the Kinzie's Addition plat and its early conveyances for the Watkins house;
Andreas at page-image level around scan pp. 305, 367 and 431 for all three.
**Covers:** `log_jail.log_1833.footprint`, `chappel_infant_school.log_1833.footprint`, `watkins_school_house.house_1833.footprint`.

### L59 — Two buildings placed in the middle of a block face
**Decision:** Eliza Chappel's log school house and the Watkins house on Michigan Street are
placed at the mid-point of the block face each is attested on, and their positions are tagged
`conjectural`.
**Why:** the evidence is a stretch of street and no more. Andreas puts the school house in "a
log house just outside the military reservation", which fixes it immediately west of State
Street — the reservation's western boundary on the south side until February 1835 — and this
project's dossier reads that as the two-block strip between South Water and Lake, tagging the
exact lot conjectural itself. Andreas puts the Watkins school "in a house on Michigan Street
between Cass and Rush", which is a block face about 110 m long. Neither source names a lot, a
corner or a side of a corner.
**Consequence:** each building stands at one specific point inside a run of frontage it could
have stood anywhere along. The error is not the georeference's ±20 m but the length of the
block: about ±60 m along State Street for the school house and about ±55 m along Michigan
Street for the Watkins house, and that is on top of the ±20 m and of an unknown setback from
the street line. A visitor sees two buildings sitting on specific lots. There are no lots.
**Why the midpoint rather than a corner:** a corner is a claim and the midpoint is the centre of
the distribution the evidence describes. It is still a point where the record has an interval.
**How to resolve:** the Kinzie's Addition plat and its conveyances for the Watkins house; any
1834–35 newspaper advertisement naming either address; Andreas at page-image level around scan
pp. 305 and 431, read for a street number or a neighbour rather than for the school.

### L61 — The first court-house is built finished, on a date that may predate it
**Decision:** the first Cook County court-house is built on the public square as a completed
one-room wooden building 24 × 18 ft. Its position within the square and every attribute of its
form are tagged `conjectural`; only its existence, its year and its function are not.
**Why, and this is two admissions rather than one.**
**(1) The date.** `illinoiscourthistory` gives one sentence — "Cook County built their first
courthouse in 1835" — and a caption, "The first Cook County Courthouse, 1835–1853". **No source
fixes a month.** On 1835-07-01 the building may have been unbuilt, under construction, or newly
finished, which is exactly what `data/exclusions.json`'s watch_list already says about it. This
record models the third of those, which on a flat prior is about half likely. **Under
construction is a phase, not an omission**, and the honest alternative would be a second phase
carrying a frame-and-no-cladding state; it is not written because nothing dates the transition
and a construction phase with invented start and end dates would be two inventions where there
is now one.
**(2) The form, and the two descriptions that must never reach it.** The famous "about thirty by
sixty feet ... front ornamented with a four-column Doric portico of wood work" is Andreas on the
**1837** court-house. And in `illinoiscourthistory` itself, two lines under the 1835 sentence,
sits "constructed in the Greek Revival style, and built with stone ... designed by ... John M.
Van Osdel" — that is the **1853** building, and it is the easier of the two to lift by mistake;
Van Osdel did not reach Chicago until 1837. This project's own dossier compounds the problem at
`docs/research/04-structures-south.md` line 178, where the corner and the phrase "a small wooden
stockade-type building" are tagged `[DOC]` to a document that contains neither. Nothing in the
record cites them, so the size, the material, the wall height, the roof and the door are all
this project's invention.
**A sting in the tail worth recording:** the corner adopted — the north-east of the square — is
reasoned from the two documented structures occupying the west corners and from the reading in
circulation ("the southwest corner of Clark & Randolph", which is the block's north-east
corner). It is ALSO the siting Andreas documents for the 1837 building, so the one placement
claim this record makes is the one an 1837 description would have contaminated it with. It is
adopted anyway, with that stated, because the alternative is a placement with no argument at all.
**How to resolve:** the Cook County commissioners' records for 1834–35. A single dated order
would carry a contract, a cost, a specification and a completion date, and would move four
attributes and the date from conjectural to documented at once.
**Covers:** `cook_county_courthouse_1835.wood_1835.footprint`, `cook_county_courthouse_1835.wood_1835.position`, `cook_county_courthouse_1835.wood_1835.form.construction`, `cook_county_courthouse_1835.wood_1835.form.wall_height_m`, `cook_county_courthouse_1835.wood_1835.form.roof_type`, `cook_county_courthouse_1835.wood_1835.form.roof_pitch_deg`, `cook_county_courthouse_1835.wood_1835.form.door`.

### L62 — Watkins' school house: one unrecorded word decides the whole building
**Decision:** the house on Michigan Street that John Watkins used as his second school is built
as a story-and-a-half braced-frame dwelling on a hall-and-parlour plan. `stories`,
`construction` and `plan` are all tagged `conjectural`.
**Why:** Andreas says "a house". That is the entire description. Frame is adopted because the
building stood in Kinzie's Addition, platted and selling in 1833, where what was going up was
new building rather than the older log stock at the forks — which is an argument about a
neighbourhood, not evidence about a house. The storey count and the plan are the
`frame_dwelling` archetype's own defaults, kept deliberately rather than replaced with fresh
numbers, on the reasoning L29 states about the bridge's pier spacing: a new figure would look
like a finding and would not be one.
**Consequence, and it is larger than an attribute:** the material decides the ARCHETYPE, and the
archetype is not a graded value. If a source says log, this record moves to `log_dwelling` and
the walls, the corners, the openings and the roof all change — a different building, not a
different attribute. The confidence view cannot show that, because it grades values and this is
a choice made one level above them. This entry is where it is recorded.
**How to resolve:** the Kinzie's Addition plat and its early conveyances; the 1833–35 *Chicago
Democrat*, which carried school advertisements and would name the house or its owner; Andreas at
page-image level around scan p. 305.
**Covers:** `watkins_school_house.house_1833.form.stories`, `watkins_school_house.house_1833.form.construction`, `watkins_school_house.house_1833.form.plan`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L63 — The Wolf Point row gains two buildings whose footprints are invented outright
**Decision:** `james_kinzie_house` (8 × 6.5 m) and `robert_kinzie_store` (7 × 6 m) are added to the
west-bank row on the strength of one clause each, with footprints tagged `conjectural` that cite no
sources.
**Why:** the sources give these two an ORDER and a NEIGHBOUR and nothing else. chicagology puts James
Kinzie's residence south of Wentworth's tavern; Andreas's list of the town's Indian traders gives
"Robert A. Kinzie, near Wentworth's tavern" (scan p. 235). Neither is described, measured, dated or
given a material. Unlike Miller's house, where an attested composition carries the SHAPE while only
the size is invented, here neither shape nor size carries anything: the polygons are ordinary
single-pen plans at ordinary sizes, chosen to sit in a river-front row.
**Consequence:** the west bank at Wolf Point now carries five structures — James Kinzie's house,
Robert Kinzie's store, the tavern, the Robinson cabins and Walker's meeting house — across about
130 m of frontage, on four ordering statements and no measured distances. Every one of them hangs off
`wolf_point_tavern`, which is itself the weakest placement in the parcel (L7). If the tavern moves,
the row moves with it.
**How to resolve:** Andreas vol. 1 at page-image level around the Wolf Point material (index: pp. 111,
114, 174, 629–631); or the retrospective Wolf Point views — Blanchard & Shober 1867, and the
"Wolf Point in 1830" plate Andreas reproduces — examined at plate level for the row's massing.
**Covers:** `james_kinzie_house.dwelling_1830.footprint`, `robert_kinzie_store.store_1830.footprint`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L64 — Two Clybourne records stand about three kilometres from their own ground, and one cabin stands for two
**Decision:** `clybourn_slaughterhouse` and `clybourn_cabins` are placed at the northern edge of the
modelled terrain on the east bank of the North Branch, with `position` tagged `conjectural`. Their
attested ground is the Clybourne place several miles up the branch — "south of the Bloomingdale Road
and opposite the North Chicago Rolling Mills" (Andreas scan p. 1149), "several miles up the North
Branch, where now are the North Chicago rolling-mills" (scan p. 215) — roughly 3 km north-north-west
of the forks and some 2.8 km beyond the box's northern edge. `clybourn_cabins` draws ONE cabin where
the dossier says the family built two, and states the count as `cabin_count` with `geometry:
"simplified"`.
**Why:** the terrain epoch models 640 m square. Dropping the buildings would have made the town's
first industry invisible; placing them at their true coordinates would have put them on the radial
skirt outside every view. The project owner's instruction of 2026-08-11 was to place at the edge of
modelled ground and say so. The BANK is preserved in both cases and is the only part of the
coordinate that carries evidence. The second cabin is not drawn because a second polygon would need
an invented spacing, an invented orientation and an invented relation to the first — three inventions
to express one number that is itself second-hand.
**Consequence:** two buildings appear at the head of the modelled North Branch that in life stood
three kilometres further up it, and a visitor who paces the distance from Wolf Point to the
slaughter-house will get an answer that is wrong by kilometres rather than by metres. The 60 m
between the cabins and the slaughter-house is invented entirely. The stock yard later called Bull's
Head is not modelled at all, and the door side of the slaughter-house — river or landward — is a coin
flip.
**How to resolve:** extend the terrain epoch north up the North Branch, at which point both records
move to their attested reach and this entry moves to Resolved.
**Covers:** `clybourn_slaughterhouse.log_1827.position`, `clybourn_slaughterhouse.log_1827.footprint`, `clybourn_slaughterhouse.log_1827.form.door_side`, `clybourn_cabins.log_1824.position`, `clybourn_cabins.log_1824.footprint`, `clybourn_cabins.log_1824.form.cabin_count`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L65 — The town's industry is modelled as sheds, and the works inside them are not built
**Decision:** four industrial records — `brickyard_north_side`, `elston_soap_candle_manufactory`,
`pierce_blacksmith_shop` and `newberry_dole_slaughterhouse_south_branch` — are each built as a single
`outbuilding` at an invented size, with their plant recorded on the record and absent from the mesh:
the brickyard's clamp, hacks, clay pit and spoil (`yard_works`), Elston's rendering kettle, ash leach
and moulding floor (`plant`), and Pierce's forge, bellows and chimney (`forge`).
**Why:** this project has archetypes for buildings and none for a WORKS. A brickyard is an area of
ground with a burning clamp on it; a soap manufactory is a fire under a kettle; a smithy is a hearth
and a stack. The outbuilding archetype builds walls and a roof and has no chimney parameter at all,
so the one visible sign of every one of these trades — smoke — cannot be built. Rather than leave the
trades out of the town, each is modelled as the shed the trade worked under and the plant is declared.
**Consequence:** the most legible failure in this parcel. Blodgett's brickyard, which supplied the
brick for the Lake House going up on the same bank, reads as one open shed in a field. Elston's
manufactory has no fire. Pierce's smithy has no smoke. The confidence chips over these attributes say
"we are fairly sure this existed" and the visitor sees nothing. This is the same shortfall L10 records
against the Western Hotel's wagon yard, now repeated four times, and it is the strongest argument in
the dataset for a works or parcel archetype. Newberry & Dole's slaughter-house is additionally placed
on a reach and a bank of the South Branch that no source gives — Andreas says only "on the South
Branch of the river" (scan p. 1151), a corridor kilometres long — and its door side is a coin flip.
**How to resolve:** a `works` or `yard` archetype that can carry an enclosure, a fire and a stack. Any
description of any of these four premises would help the footprints; nothing found describes one.
**Covers:** `brickyard_north_side.yard_1833.footprint`, `brickyard_north_side.yard_1833.form.yard_works`, `elston_soap_candle_manufactory.works_1833.footprint`, `elston_soap_candle_manufactory.works_1833.form.plant`, `pierce_blacksmith_shop.shop_1833.footprint`, `pierce_blacksmith_shop.shop_1833.form.forge`, `newberry_dole_slaughterhouse_south_branch.works_1834.footprint`, `newberry_dole_slaughterhouse_south_branch.works_1834.position`, `newberry_dole_slaughterhouse_south_branch.works_1834.form.door_side`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L66 — Two river warehouses stand on banks that are disputed or unattested, and neither has its dock
**Decision:** `newberry_dole_warehouse` is placed on the SOUTH bank of the main stem with its position
tagged `conjectural`, against an Andreas sentence that puts the firm's warehouse on the north side;
`kinzie_hunter_warehouse` is placed on the NORTH bank with its position AND its date range tagged
`conjectural`, on a plausibility the dossier itself tags `[CONJ]`. Both records state `dock: true`
with `geometry: "absent"`, and neither dock is built.
**Why (the bank):** this project's own dossiers disagree. docs/research/03-structures-north.md §3.10
reports a square frame "Newberry and Dole's Forwarding and Commission House" on South Water Street in
views of c. 1835; docs/research/04-structures-south.md quotes Andreas — "whose warehouse was on the
North Side, immediately east of where Rush-street bridge now stands" (scan p. 1139) — and instructs
"Do not put it on South Water Street." The south bank is adopted because Andreas's sentence sits
inside an account of a grain shipment made on the brig *Osceola* in **1839**, so the building it
locates is the firm's warehouse four years after the scene date. That is reasoning, not proof, and the
disagreement is recorded rather than resolved. Kinzie & Hunter's bank is not disputed but simply
absent: the dossier lists it as an open gap, "bank, date, size".
**Why (the dock):** "each had a warehouse with its dock along the river front" is the clause that
attests these buildings at all, and Andreas independently names "Newberry & Dole's wharf" as the place
the schooner *Illinois* was cheered on 12 July 1834 (scan p. 503). The project has a `pier_crib`
archetype for the harbour piers and nothing for a river wharf; a dock of invented length, height and
construction sitting in the water would be a larger invention than the buildings it served.
**Consequence:** the river trade — the reason the town existed in 1835 — is represented by two sheds
standing back from an empty bank. On `kinzie_hunter_warehouse` the `dock` attribute carries a
`documented` chip over nothing at all, which is precisely the failure the geometry declarations exist
to surface. And one of the two warehouses is probably on the wrong side of the river.
**How to resolve:** identify the c. 1835 view the north-side dossier describes and give it a source
record; or read further issues of the *Chicago Democrat*, whose advertising columns are where a
forwarding house states its street.
**Covers:** `newberry_dole_warehouse.frame_1833.position`, `newberry_dole_warehouse.frame_1833.footprint`, `newberry_dole_warehouse.frame_1833.form.dock`, `kinzie_hunter_warehouse.warehouse_1834.position`, `kinzie_hunter_warehouse.warehouse_1834.footprint`, `kinzie_hunter_warehouse.warehouse_1834.form.dock`, `kinzie_hunter_warehouse.warehouse_1834.documented_range`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L67 — A trade advertised in November 1833 becomes a building standing in July 1835
**Decision:** `elston_soap_candle_manufactory` is built from a newspaper advertisement, with both its
`documented_range` and its `position` tagged `conjectural`.
**Why:** the *Chicago Democrat* of 26 November 1833 carries Daniel Elston & Co.'s soap and candle
manufactory, paying cash for tallow and house ashes, and Andreas's summary of the same columns repeats
it (scan p. 755). That fixes a TRADE in a month — and the source record for the paper states the limit
in as many words: an advertisement is "strong evidence of existence and address, weak evidence of
survival, and no evidence at all of form." The scene date is nineteen months later, in the town's
fastest-changing period. No address is given anywhere. The works are placed on the east bank of the
North Branch on two unevidenced arguments: that Elston is a North Branch figure (the road named for
him, and his later brickyard on that side — Andreas scan pp. 409, 1169, both decades after the scene),
and that rendering is a nuisance trade that sits at the edge of a town near its slaughtering. Every
other locatable advertiser in the same issue was on or near South Water Street, which is at least as
good an argument the other way and is written into the record's position note.
**Consequence:** a manufactory appears on the North Branch that may have stood on South Water Street,
or may not have been standing at all by July 1835. It is built because an absent building is invisible
to a visitor while a conjectural one is legible and correctable — the project owner's standing
instruction of 2026-08-11 — and because the tallow trade belongs beside the slaughtering this parcel
also models.
**How to resolve:** further issues of the *Chicago Democrat*. One line of an 1834 or 1835
advertisement carrying a street would settle the position and narrow the range at once.
**Covers:** `elston_soap_candle_manufactory.works_1833.documented_range`, `elston_soap_candle_manufactory.works_1833.position`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L68 — The slough crossing is invented at every dimension except its material
**Decision:** `slough_log_bridge` is built at an invented 8 × 3 m deck with `clearance_m` 0.5 m tagged
`conjectural`, and it deliberately does NOT borrow the branch bridges' documented figures.
**Why:** the source gives one sentence — where Water Street crossed the slough, a log bridge was
needed until after 1840 — and one adjective, *log*. The span is sized off the STREAM rather than the
bridge: the hydrology dossier gives the slough a width of 15–40 ft (zone 14) and tags width and depth
conjectural while calling the route documented, so 8 m of deck crosses the narrow end of that range.
The clearance is the number that mattered most to get wrong quietly: the two branch bridges stood
"about six feet above the water, so that teams passed under them on the ice freely", which is
documented for THEM and absurd here — nothing passed under a slough crossing. 0.5 m is a reading of a
conjectural stream depth, not a measurement.
**Consequence:** a visitor sees a small timber deck whose every proportion is this project's. If the
slough ran 40 ft wide at the crossing, the span is half what it should be.
**How to resolve:** any period description of the crossing, or a surveyed width for the slough at the
foot of State Street.

**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.


### L70 — The mosquitoes are rendered as nothing, and they were the defining July fact
**Decision:** mosquitoes, deer flies and horse flies are recorded as `abundant` and
`not_perceptible` in four zones, and nothing is drawn for any of them.
**Why:** the insects will not read at any render scale. Their visible signal is *human* — smudge
fires, mosquito bars over beds, covered arms, hands moving at faces — and L1 puts human depiction
out of scope for v1. So the single most intense sensory fact of a July Chicago, in a town "situated
in the midst of sloughs and marshes" with endemic ague and no window screens, is rendered as
absence.
**Consequence:** a visitor walks a July wetland town that feels comfortable. It was not. The only
sourced testimony for it sits on a page that returned HTTP 403 and has no source record, so even
the quotation is unverified; Andreas is not and never will be a source for it — searches for
*mosquito*, *mosquitoes* and *musquitoes* all return zero hits.
**How to resolve:** a retrievable period source, and either a smoke/smudge element in the
structures dataset or the lifting of L1.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L71 — The horse herds at the town margin are attested and not depicted
**Decision:** `f01_wet_prairie/equus_caballus_indigenous_herds` records the herds with
`status: excluded_by_scope` and `presence: not_depicted`. Nothing is placed.
**Why:** Shirreff described the prairies around Chicago in 1833 as studded with tents and numerous
herds of horses browsing in all directions. Those herds are inseparable from the people who kept
them, and AGENTS.md and L1 put human depiction out of scope for v1 uniformly. The great assembly at
Chicago is 18 August 1835 — six and a half weeks *after* the scene date — so staging it would be
wrong twice over.
**Consequence:** the prairie margin is emptier than it was. This is a scope decision, not a finding
of absence, and the dataset distinguishes the two: `not_depicted` is a different value from
`absent` and the validator will not let one be written as the other.
**Note:** the Shirreff 1833 account has no source record in `data/sources/`; only the August 1835
date is cited, from `chicagology_lastwardance`, and nothing beyond that date is drawn from it.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L72 — The town's outbuildings are placed and sized by eye, on the strength of the buildings in front of them
**Decision:** the three secondary buildings added behind the town's public houses —
`western_hotel_stable` (13 x 7 m), `wolf_point_tavern_stable` (9 x 6 m) and `beaubien_barn`
(6.10 x 4.88 m) — carry **invented footprints**, two carry **invented positions**, and two carry an
**invented door elevation**, all tagged `conjectural`, citing no sources.
**Why:** not one source reached by this project gives any outbuilding at the forks a dimension, a
plan or a bearing. What the sources give is existence and relation: a stable "in the rear" of the
Western Hotel, a county tariff that prices keeping a horse overnight at a house one of whose
keepers held the county's first tavern licence, and a cabin that "he used after this for a barn".
The sizes answer the attested TRADE rather than being chosen freely — the Western's stable is the
largest outbuilding in the dataset because its source calls it large and its teams "were as
numerous as were the guests"; the Wolf Point stable is smaller so the two are not one invented
building at two addresses; and the Beaubien barn is drawn at single-pen CABIN scale, 20 x 16 ft,
because the source describes a dwelling that stopped being one rather than a barn that was built.
**Consequence:** a visitor sees three buildings whose *presence* is evidenced and whose *shape and
exact place* are ours. The Beaubien barn additionally inherits what is left of its parent record's
open questions. **Updated 2026-09-06 (T-0718):** the corner is no longer one of them — Andreas scan
p. 339 turned out to be John Wentworth's 1881 address reprinted, expressly an instruction for finding
this house, and the parent moved about 47 m to the **north-east** corner and this barn with it. What
still travels is that neither street existed on the unplatted reservation in 1835, and that
Wentworth's lots 6-10 lie north of the corner lot by an unmeasured distance. The move also put the
barn on the flank of the sand ridge, where the heightfield's 0.35 m of relief across its footprint is
two millimetres over the walker's step-up rule, so its **ground contact** is declared
`approach_not_modelled` and is covered here too.
**How to resolve:** Wright 1834 or Hathaway 1834 read at lot level for the Randolph-and-Canal
block; Andreas "Wharfs, Piers and Early Hotels", scan pp. 626-631, at page-image level for the Wolf
Point group; the 1839 land-sale plat of Block 5 with the lot numbers Andreas quotes — that plat would
now also fix how far north of the corner lot the group stood.
**Covers:** `western_hotel_stable.stable_1834.footprint`, `wolf_point_tavern_stable.stable_1831.footprint`, `wolf_point_tavern_stable.stable_1831.position`, `wolf_point_tavern_stable.stable_1831.form.door_side`, `beaubien_barn.converted_1817.footprint`, `beaubien_barn.converted_1817.position`, `beaubien_barn.converted_1817.form.door_side`, `beaubien_barn.converted_1817.ground_contact`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L73 — Every outbuilding in the town is detailed by the archetype, not by a source
**Decision:** the `outbuilding` archetype supplies, as fixed conventions applied to every record
that uses it and stated by no source anywhere: the **single small unglazed vent** it cuts in a
wall; the **post spacing** in an open bay; the **board rhythm** of a boarded wall; the **roof
covering** (laid boards — not shingles, not shakes, not thatch); and the **direction a shed roof
falls**, which the archetype derives from the open sides rather than reading from the record. The
size-aware defaults for wall height, roof form and pitch are conventions in the same sense.
**Why:** no source reached by this project describes the fabric, the covering, the openings or the
framing of ANY outbuilding at the forks — not one. The archetype's own module says so at the top
and grades an unstated attribute `conjectural` for exactly this reason, so the confidence channel
already paints these buildings honestly; what it cannot say is that the *detail a visitor is
looking at* was designed rather than found.
**Consequence:** two outbuildings in this scene that carry different evidence still share a vent, a
board rhythm and a roof texture, because those came from one Python module. Anyone reading a
boarded wall as a finding about 1835 Chicago carpentry is reading the generator.
**How to resolve:** any period description or depiction of a secondary building at Chicago before
1836 — none is currently known to this project. This entry has no `Covers:` field on purpose: it
claims nothing about any single record, because the invention is in the archetype and lands on
every one of them.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L74 — Tremont House I: a hotel built two storeys tall because three rests on one modern sentence
**Decision:** the first Tremont House is built at the north-west corner of Lake and Dearborn as a
**two-storey** braced-frame block 50 × 30 ft, unpainted, gable-roofed and without a gallery. The
storey count, the wall height, the roof, the paint, the gallery and the footprint are all tagged
`conjectural`.
**Why, and the storey count is the whole entry.** What is documented about this building is
unusually good: the corner three times over, frame construction three times over, Alanson Sweet
as builder, Ira Couch as proprietor from 1834, and destruction by fire on 27 October 1839. What
is not documented is its height. `chicagology_prefire021` prints an uncredited modern "Building
Summary" — "a three-story wooden building" — beside two period texts that count no storeys at
all: the Chicago *Tribune* letter of 2 February 1874 ("an unpretending frame structure") and
*Chicago Illustrated* of January 1866 ("a wooden structure"). Andreas, who gives the building a
builder, a corner, a material, four proprietors and a death date, gives it no height. So the
three-storey Tremont has exactly one witness and it is a modern editor;
`docs/research/04-structures-south.md` line 155 weighs it twice by citing "chicagology and
Wikipedia". **Two is adopted and is still a guess**, on three arguments that are not evidence:
Chicago in 1833 held about 350 people and *Wau-Bun* found the Sauganash's TWO storeys remarkable
two years earlier; the *Chicago American*'s "Improvements in 1836", quoted by Andreas, counts
"about twenty large two to three-story wooden buildings" among that year's NEW work; and this
project already excludes the Saloon Building of 1836 partly as the town's first three-storey
structure.
**Consequence:** if the three-storey reading is right the building stands about 2.6 m taller than
the model shows, and it would be the tallest thing in the 1835 scene. Everything else here is the
usual: no source measures the house, describes its roof, names its finish or mentions a porch,
and the confidence view renders the whole block as massing. **One documented thing about this
building IS carried and is not built**: Ira Couch's "a mere shell, without any sidewalk around
it". This project builds no plank walks anywhere, so the record states `sidewalk: false` as
`record_only` — a negative finding about the ground, not an omission.
**How to resolve:** the *Daily American*'s account of the 27 October 1839 fire, which Andreas
quotes for the merchants' stock losses and which itemised insurance building by building; or any
*Chicago American* or *Chicago Democrat* advertisement of the house, which in the period counted
rooms.
**Covers:** `tremont_house_1.frame_1833.footprint`, `tremont_house_1.frame_1833.form.stories`, `tremont_house_1.frame_1833.form.wall_height_m`, `tremont_house_1.frame_1833.form.roof_type`, `tremont_house_1.frame_1833.form.paint`, `tremont_house_1.frame_1833.form.gallery`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L75 — Mansion House: an attested frame front, built on invented arms
**Decision:** Dexter Graves's log tavern on Lake Street near Dearborn is built as a 12 × 9 m
one-storey log core with a one-storey frame block 12 m wide and 4 m deep across its front. The
footprint, the wing's width, its depth, its storey count and its finish are all tagged
`conjectural`.
**Why:** Andreas describes this building's growth in a sentence that is worth more than anything
else in the parcel — "As originally built, the Mansion House was situated some little distance
back from the street, but two years later Mr. Graves erected a frame addition in the front, which
came out to a line with the street" — and the sentence contains no numbers. So the *side* of the
addition is documented (the only one in this dataset that is; the Wolf Point Tavern's is
conjectural, L24), and its size is not. **The 4 m depth is the invention doing the most work: it
stands in for "some little distance back from the street", which is an unmeasured setback**, and
anything from a two-metre porch depth to a full second range is compatible with the sentence. The
12 m width is set to the full frontage so the new block presents one continuous face to Lake
Street, which is what the RESULT implies and not what the width does; a narrower block would
leave a notch at one end that no source describes and that would read as a modelled fact about
the plan. One storey for the addition is an argument from silence — a two-storey front on a
one-storey log tavern would have been the more remarkable thing and would probably have been
said.
**Consequence:** the building's south face stands exactly on the Lake Street building line, which
IS attested, and every metre behind that line is chosen. The overall 12 × 9 m rests on two weak
arguments — it later took two street numbers, 84 and 86 Lake Street, and it held a room the
Circuit Court sat in — and neither is a measurement. The unfinished loft, which the court sat in,
is `documented` and is built as a gable-end opening and nothing else, since a loft leaves no
other external trace.
**How to resolve:** *Chicago Democrat* or *Chicago American* advertisements of the house under
Haddock or Markle, which in the period counted rooms; or a Cook County deed on the lots that
became Nos. 84 and 86 Lake Street, which would give the frontage from a document rather than from
a street-number inference.

### L76 — The Exchange Coffee House: five documented facts, and not one of them about the building
**Decision:** Mark Beaubien's second hotel is built at the north-west corner of Lake and Wells as
a two-storey braced-frame block 46 × 30 ft, unpainted, gable-roofed, without a gallery. The
construction, the storey count, the wall height, the roof, the paint, the gallery and the
footprint are all tagged `conjectural`.
**Why:** two independent passages of Andreas — the hotel chapter and the life of Mark Beaubien —
agree on the builder, the corner, the year, the keepers and the name, which is more agreement
than any other building in this parcel gets. Neither says what it was made of, how big it was,
how many storeys it had or what it looked like. **The consequential guess is `construction`,
because it also chose the ARCHETYPE**: a frame reading makes this a `frame_tavern` and a log
reading would make it a `log_dwelling`, so if it is wrong the building is wrong in kind and not
merely in detail — the same admission L62 makes for Watkins' school house. The argument for frame
is that every Chicago hotel this dataset can date to 1833 or later is frame while the log taverns
belong to 1828-31; the argument against treating that as evidence is L18, that the ordinary
reading of a TYPE is not evidence about a BUILDING — and the man who built this one had made his
last hotel by adding a frame block onto a log cabin.
**Consequence:** the confidence view renders the whole house as massing, correctly. The facade
bearing is a second unclaimed choice of the same kind: no source says which street the house
fronted, and a corner house called an *Exchange*, at which stage seats were later booked, could
as easily have turned its front to Wells. **A correction this record carries rather than
inherits:** `data/exclusions.json` and `docs/research/04-structures-south.md` both say stage
seats were taken here "in 1835-36". Andreas dates that advertisement to the *Chicago American* of
**6 August 1836**, thirteen months after the scene date, so the record does not claim a
stage-office function for 1835. The exclusion of a separate stage-office BUILDING is unaffected.
**How to resolve:** the *Chicago Democrat* and the *Chicago American*, in both of which this
house was a standing address; and the 1834-36 Cook County tavern licences, which would also
settle whether Abram A. Markle held this house and the Mansion House at the same time.

### L77 — The Lake House is a building site built with a fort's archetype, one storey up, on a corner nobody halved
**Decision:** the Lake House is modelled as a **construction site**: a roofless brick shell one
storey high on a 79 × 49 ft plan, at the corner of Rush and Michigan streets on the north bank,
built with the `fort_structure` archetype under `kind: "magazine"`. The position, the footprint,
the archetype `kind`, the storey count and the wall height are all tagged `conjectural`.
**Why, and it is three admissions.**
**(1) How far it had risen is unattested, and that is the interesting part.** Everything about
the FINISHED hotel is documented — brick, three storeys and a basement, nearly $100,000, five
named backers, opened in the autumn of 1836. Nothing says what stood on the ground on 1 July
1835; `chicagology_prefire112`'s own *what_it_does_not_supply* list says so in terms. One storey
comes from a schedule argument — ground broken somewhere in 1835, open by autumn 1836, so about
eighteen months for three storeys and a basement of brick, putting 1 July 1835 in the first
quarter of the work — and the honest range is **zero to two**. At three storeys this structure
would stand about 12 m and be the tallest thing in the scene, which is exactly what
`data/exclusions.json`'s `lake_house_finished` entry exists to prevent. The best anchor found is
J. D. Bonnell's letter to the *Chicago Times* of 15 March 1876, quoted by Andreas, seeing "the
Lake House in course of construction" on a date the letter gives as 25 August 1835 — eight weeks
after the scene date — though the same letter's "forty years ago" implies 1836 and Andreas's
lead-in says 1837. The 1837 reading is impossible on the letter's own content.
**(2) The archetype is off-label and `kind: "magazine"` is a selector, not a claim.** It does not
say the Lake House was a powder magazine. `fort_structure` is the ONLY archetype in this project
whose vocabulary admits `construction: brick` AND `roof_type: none`, and brick is the one
documented fact about this structure's fabric while rooflessness is the one important fact about
its state; `magazine` is the only one of its eleven builders that draws a plain masonry
rectangle with a single opening and no windows, where every other kind would cut a regular window
rhythm and render a building site as a finished hotel. `frame_tavern` would build a windowed,
roofed, five-bay house; `outbuilding` can build neither brick nor a roofless structure — the same
constraint L60 records for the estray pen, which had to take a roof it probably never had. The
archetype's own docstring already extends it past the fort once, to the 1832 lighthouse.
**(3) The corner is documented and the side of the street is not.** Andreas twice puts the house
at Kinzie, Rush and Michigan streets, fronting Michigan. A block between Kinzie and Michigan has
two faces on Rush about 110 m apart and nothing says which; the east side is adopted on a
neighbourhood argument. **Guard travelling with it:** north-side Michigan Street is today's East
Hubbard Street, one block north of Kinzie — NOT Michigan Avenue, which did not cross the river
until 1920. The gloss "near where the Wrigley Building stands today", on `chicagology_prefire112`
and repeated in `docs/research/03-structures-north.md` §3.8 (which also renders the street as
"Michigan (Water)"), moves the site about 150 m and across Kinzie.
**Consequence:** what a visitor sees is a low roofless brick rectangle, which is right in kind
and invented in every dimension. **What the model still cannot show is the excavation** — a
construction site is a hole in the ground before it is anything else, and nothing in this project
cuts a cellar into the terrain, so the shell sits ON the surface rather than in it. The footprint
also asserts a full rectangle walled to one height where a real site would be part cellar, part
first-course brickwork, part mortar-bed, scaffold and stacked material.
**How to resolve:** the *Chicago American* (first issue 8 June 1835) and the *Chicago Democrat*
for 1835-36 — a $100,000 hotel going up in a town of three thousand was news; and the Kinzie's
Addition conveyances, which would give the lots, the plan and the side of Rush Street at once.

### L78 — A saddler's corner survives nineteen months on nothing but a paid advertisement
**Decision:** `goss_cobb_saddlery` is built at the crossing of Lake and Canal from one newspaper
advertisement, with its `documented_range`, its `footprint` and its storey count tagged
`conjectural`.
**Why:** the *Chicago Democrat* of 26 November 1833 carries the firm's own notice — "they have
opened a shop in this village, on the conner of Lake and Canal-streets" — which is a **tier-1,
self-reported address**, better positional evidence than most records in this dataset hold,
because the advertiser's customers had to be able to find him. It fixes a trade and a junction in
one week of November 1833 and does nothing else. **The scene date is nineteen months later**, in
the town's fastest-changing period, and `data/sources/chicago_democrat_1833_11_26.json` states
the limit in as many words: an advertisement is "strong evidence of existence and address, weak
evidence of survival, and no evidence at all of form". Nothing reached follows this firm past
November 1833. The building stands anyway, on the project owner's standing instruction that an
absent building is invisible while a conjectural one is legible and correctable — the same
reasoning L67 gives for Elston's soap works, from the same issue of the same paper.
**Consequence:** a shop stands on Lake Street that may have been gone, moved or rebuilt by July
1835, at a size and a storey count nobody recorded. **Two positional admissions travel with it.**
The advertisement names a *junction*, not a corner, exactly as the Democrat's own imprint says
"on the corner of South Water and Clark-streets" and names none; the Green Tree Tavern holds the
north-east quadrant of this crossing, three remain, and this record picks the south-east — a
one-in-three choice worth about 40 m. And "Canal" at this crossing inherits the doubt already
recorded on the Green Tree: modern Canal Street lies a full block back from the west bank, where
the 1830s riverbank street was West Water, so if the advertisement means the bank street the shop
belongs about **145 m east**. That is the larger of the two and it is the same open question the
Green Tree's own record carries; settling one settles both. The `position` is nonetheless tagged
`inferred` rather than `conjectural`, because the junction itself is documented and it is only
the quadrant that is chosen — the doubt is written on the record rather than in the tag.
**How to resolve:** further issues of the *Chicago Democrat* and the *Chicago American*, one line
of which would settle survival and might name a side; and the lot geometry on Wright 1834 or
Hathaway 1834, which would settle Canal against West Water for this record and for the Green Tree
at once.
**Covers:** `goss_cobb_saddlery.shop_1833.footprint`, `goss_cobb_saddlery.shop_1833.form.stories`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.
**Revised:** 2026-08-29 — **one of this entry's three admissions has been discharged and the
other two have not**, so the entry stays where it is with a narrower `Covers:` line rather than
moving to Resolved. What the entry above calls for in its own last field — *"further issues of
the Chicago Democrat and the Chicago American, one line of which would settle survival and might
name a side"* — arrived. The *Chicago American* sets S. B. Cobb's trading card three times
across the scene date: 1835-06-08 p3 c5, 1835-06-13 p3 c6 and 1835-07-11 p2 c1, the middle one
reading *"[S]A[D]DLE, HARNESS & TRUNK M[anufa]c[tor]y. S[. ]B[. ]COB[B] [w]il[l] [c]o[nt]in[ue]
the [above business] at his shop, corner [o]f [… ][st]re[et]s"*. **Survival is settled**, and
past the scene date at that, so `documented_range` is graded `inferred` and leaves this entry's
coverage. **The side is not**: all three printings lose the cross street, so the quadrant choice
and the Canal-versus-West-Water doubt this entry records stand exactly as written, as do the
`footprint` and the storey count, which the American says nothing about. The one thing the
paper added that this entry did not ask for is that the firm it is named for was **dissolved on
18 February 1835** and Cobb carried the shop on alone; that is a correction to the record's
`occupants` and its signboard, not a liberty, because it replaces an invention with a document.

### L79 — The street corridors are measured; the travelled earth inside them is drawn by eye
**Decision:** every visible street is an earth ribbon draped on the terrain, but the widths of
those ribbons — 10.5 m on South Water and Lake, 8 m on Market, 7 m on ordinary streets and
5.8-6 m on lightly travelled streets — are not measurements. Neither are the paired wagon ruts,
the thin grassy crown between them, their colour, or the relative amount of bare soil assigned
to the three traffic classes. The 80 ft legal corridor is evidence and stays separate from this
narrower travelled strip.
**Why:** the 1834 plats and the measured street module supply the rights-of-way, not a road-bed
inside them. The Department of Public Works chronology supplies a sequence and a distinction:
South Water and Lake were the two principal early turnpiked and graded routes; Canal, western
Lake and Randolph received named work in fall 1836; planking and hard paving belong much later.
It supplies no cross-section, rut spacing, soil colour, carriageway width or block-by-block wear.
Those values are visual interpretation chosen to make the documented distinction visible without
putting a modern road inside an 1835 plat.
**Consequence:** a visitor can correctly read principal graded earth against a lesser worn-earth
street and can see grass survive across most of an 80 ft corridor, but cannot treat any rut or
edge as survey geometry. Several path extents are analytic extensions from the platted module;
North Water's bank-following curve is explicitly conjectural. South Water's travelled strip is
shifted into the dry half of its riverfront corridor so it does not paint the river, a conclusion
from this model's heightfield rather than a measured 1835 carriageway alignment. Wherever the
heightfield says water, the ribbon is cut away; that is a rendering guard, not evidence that no
temporary crossing existed.
**How to resolve:** a dated street-improvement specification, town-surveyor section, assessment
record, or close contemporary street depiction giving a cross-section or travelled width. Until
one appears, the data keeps geometry, surface and wear confidence separate and calls the wear
`conjectural`.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.

### L80 — The unresolved far prairie is terrain colour, not a second plant-height surface
**Decision:** beyond the detailed near- and middle-distance plants, the prairie is represented
by the procedural colour and grain already painted on the terrain. There is no horizontal mesh
at the top of the sward. This supersedes L33's implementation of the far prairie as a solid
plant-height sheet; L33 stays above as the append-only record of the decision that was tried.
**Why:** real-device views showed that the sheet read as a second elevated ground layer. It hid
the bases of buildings — conspicuously the Exchange Coffee House — and the lower portions of
plants while the walker remained on the actual heightfield below it. Moving the walker,
buildings or roots up to that sheet would have promoted a rendering approximation into false
topography. Removing it leaves one shared physical and visible surface.
**Consequence:** the far prairie preserves its broad July-green colour but no longer claims a
separate plant-top silhouette or species-resolved height. Detailed geometry still represents
the recorded plants near and in the middle distance, rooted exactly on land or at the water
surface; the far texture is an unresolved visual compression, not something a visitor can stand
on. Distant vegetation may consequently look smoother until a terrain-rooted replacement is
built.
**How to resolve:** terrain-rooted impostors or sparse geometry whose base follows the
heightfield and whose alpha silhouette never closes into a walk-through horizontal sheet. Any
replacement must retain the one-surface root and building-anchor regression checks.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-11.
**Revised:** 2026-08-13 — where the detailed plants hand over to the terrain colour is no
longer one distance. It had been a circle about the walker, and a constant world radius is a
constant screen ROW on ground this flat: 27 m mapped to row 450 and held it, razor straight,
across all 1280 columns. Each lattice slot now carries its own outer radius, the layer's
nominal one plus a world-anchored offset of up to ±3 m at full detail (±1.6 m on a phone,
about an eighth of the ring at every setting), drawn from smooth 4 m lobes with a per-slot
dither on top. **The compression this entry admits to is unchanged in kind and in mean
extent** — the offset is symmetric, so the sward reaches no further on average than it did,
and the terrain texture still carries everything beyond it. What changes is that the join is
a thinning rather than an edge, and that a visitor cannot mistake the end of the geometry
budget for a line on the ground. The amplitude is a rendering constant like the radius it
perturbs; nothing about it is a claim about where the prairie stopped.

### L81 — Forty-eight anonymous roofs begin the inferred inventory; none is a recovered building
**Decision:** forty principal and eight ancillary roofs are added to five South Division mixed
blocks as the first visible parcel of the 665-roof reconstruction programme. Each carries a
D/C/W/F/A production-family code, deterministic variation, and the specification's dimensional
band. Every existing structure record is retained. The new shapes are explicitly flagged
placeholder massing until the matching canonical archetype bakes are produced.
**Why:** the owner-supplied 2026 specification gives a coherent aggregate inventory, district
matrix, density rules and family bands, but states that no parcel-by-parcel July 1835 roof census
survives. A complete town cannot therefore be built by silently promoting a rational allocation
into documentary fact. These records make the allocation inspectable while keeping the
individual presence, lot position and footprint at conjectural confidence.
**Consequence:** the blocks read as a town rather than as isolated landmarks, but no visitor may
infer that roof #023—or any other numbered roof—has an attested owner, use, size or address.
The records are inventory slots. A named building found later replaces a suitable slot through
an explicit substitution; it is not added on top of the 665 target. D5/D6 gable-front extremes
are constrained to the current eaves-front dwelling generator in this first parcel, and C2's
one-and-a-half-storey type is compressed to one storey plus loft until its family archetype is
implemented.
**How to resolve:** reconcile every existing record to physical roof units, then replace these
massings with the 35 family archetypes and replace individual slots only when parcel-specific
evidence is found. Exact lot geometry requires a contemporary tax, assessment, deed, insurance,
or surveyed building register.

### L90 — Twenty West Division roofs, and thirty-five held back for want of ground
**Decision:** instantiate the West Division approaches parcel from
`data/reconstruction/1835_phase2_west_wolf_point_approaches.json` — but only the 20 placements
(15 principal or functional, 5 ancillary) whose centres fall inside the modelled terrain. The
other 35 are NOT built. Aggregate mix follows the reconstruction specification; every individual
presence, position, footprint, finish and detail remains conjectural.
**Why 35 are missing, which is the more interesting half.** The recipe's own
`terrain_and_hydrology_gate` blocks any placement west of local E -300 m until the heightfield,
collision surface, vegetation sampler, minimap and water mask share a box extended to E -700 m.
The committed ground still stops at E -320 m. A roof beyond it would stand on nothing, sample no
terrain, and the ground-contact gate would have no surface to test it against — so the honest
West Division is a partial one until the ground is extended. The held slots keep their ids and
their family allocation and instantiate unchanged the day it is.
**What else moved, and why.** Eight of the twenty stood inside a platted street corridor, by 2.2
to 11.7 m. That is the recipe's date rather than its judgement: it was authored before ROADMAP K7
generated the Thompson block and lot geometry, so nothing could check a layout against a street
until now. Each is set back to the nearest position clearing the corridor that still passes every
other gate; the largest move is 12.5 m, inside the ±20 m working uncertainty the recipe states for
its own coordinates, so no slot leaves its allocated block. The shifts are frozen constants in
`tools/generate_west_infill.py`, not a search run at generation time, because a placement that
moves when an unrelated gate changes is not reproducible.
**Consequence:** the west bank reads as approached and worked rather than empty, while remaining
inspectably interpretive. No numbered roof identifies an owner, address, use or observed building.
A later named discovery substitutes for a compatible anonymous slot rather than increasing the
665-roof programme. H2 boarding-house massing uses a flagged generic frame block pending a
canonical archetype.
**How to resolve:** parcel-specific tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for any
individual roof; extending the terrain box west releases the other 35 without re-authoring them.

### L82 — Sixty North Division roofs are count-units, not recovered buildings
**Decision:** add 45 principal or functional and 15 ancillary anonymous roofs inside the already
modelled North Division terrain. Their aggregate mix follows the reconstruction specification;
every individual presence, position, footprint, finish and detail remains conjectural. Slot 41
moves 7.1 m within its stated 25 m review radius because its draft footprint crossed 1.43 m of
terrain relief. H2, H3 and I2 use flagged generic block massings pending canonical archetypes.
**Why:** the reviewed parcel satisfies the North district programme without requiring the risky
outer terrain extension. Automated checks reject water, uncovered terrain, overlapping footprints
and perimeter relief above the walker's 0.35 m contract.
**Consequence:** the north bank reads as inhabited while remaining inspectably interpretive. No
numbered roof identifies an owner, address, use or observed building. A later named discovery
substitutes for a compatible anonymous slot rather than increasing the 665-roof programme.
**How to resolve:** parcel-specific tax, deed, assessment, construction or surveyed building
evidence; canonical H and I family archetypes replace the temporary massing without changing count.

### L83 — The inferred-residents programme: a population reconstructed to justify buildings
**Decision:** `data/residents/` reconstructs Chicago's 1835 population as a dataset — 72
households, 96 person entries — because the population is what justifies the buildings. Every
household that needs a dwelling eventually becomes a structure record on the plat.
**Why:** the town census of 1835 counts **3,265 people in 398 dwellings**. This dataset can name
about ninety of them. The gap between those numbers is the whole argument for the programme: the
buildings a visitor walks past are only defensible if somebody lived in them, and the honest way
to place four hundred roofs is to reason from who the town demonstrably held.
**What is invented, and how you can tell.** Every person carries an accuracy grade, on an axis
kept deliberately separate from the project's attribute confidence. `documented` means a source
names them. `derived` means a real, named person whose details are partly reconstructed — their
trade is attested and their household size is not, or their forename reaches us through another
record, or their presence on the day is read across from a partnership. `inferred` means a
hypothesised resident filling a demonstrable need of the town: not a real person, but a person
the evidence says must have existed. **Phase one contains no inferred residents at all** — 76
documented and 20 derived — so that the shape could be proved before the volume was added. Later
phases add them and they are labelled.
**What we refused to invent.** Where a source counts people it does not name — "a wife and four
children", "James Kinzie and family" — the record carries ONE placeholder entry whose name states
the count, rather than five invented individuals. Where the town's first architect, its most
famous early citizen and some forty militia signatories are known to have been here but could not
be tied to a source this project holds, they are recorded as open research items and not written:
**William B. Ogden's widely repeated June 1835 arrival could not be traced to any source in this
dataset, so he is an open item rather than a citation to nothing.** Where a documented resident
cannot be distinguished from another man of the same name, neither is written.
**Where the people were.** Twenty-four of the seventy-two households are NOT recorded as certainly
present on 1 July 1835 — being a resident and being in town on one day are different claims, and
the dataset separates them. The town's Presbyterian minister was married at Rochester, New York
sixteen days before the scene date; its first doctor divided his time with Texas; the Mansion
House changed hands at an unrecorded point in the scene year. The dataset says "uncertain" in each
case rather than choosing.
**No person is drawn.** L1 stands and is not weakened by this layer: v1 ships no human figures.
This is a dataset that populates the Evidence panel and licenses buildings, and nothing in it
causes a figure to appear in the scene.
**The Potawatomi.** The final removal is August 1835, six weeks after the scene date. Seven
households touch it — the Indian agency's establishment, the families with Native kin, and the two
Native households the sources name at Wolf Point — and every one blocks this scene from being
marked released until the consultation this project has committed to has happened. Where the
sources disagree about the removal's date by a year, both readings are recorded and neither is
averaged away.

### L84 — Eighty households nobody named, and the thirty-eight buildings they justify
**Decision:** phase two of the inferred-residents programme (`docs/ROADMAP.md` K1) adds **80
inferred households and 92 inferred person entries** to `data/residents/`, **adopts 83 of the
108 anonymous roofs** already on the plat as their dwellings and workplaces, and raises **38 new
structure records** — seven documented buildings that had no record, and 31 inferred buildings
the occupation census requires. Every new record's existence, position and footprint is
`conjectural`, and this entry is what admits it.
**Why:** the 1835 town census counts **3,265 people in 398 dwellings**; this dataset could name
about ninety of them and held 108 roofs with no occupant at all. A roof nobody lived in is
massing, not a building. The layer reasons from ratios the project can check — the 1833 trade
roster against the 1835 census, and the reconstruction specification's own roof schedule as a
ceiling on each trade — so that the town reaches its density through argued households rather
than through anonymous count-units.
**What is invented, and how you can tell.** Three things, in descending order of how much they
matter. **(1) That any of these people existed.** They are hypotheses about counts: a town of
3,265 in 398 dwellings held at least this many households of this trade. **No inferred person
has a name** — every one carries a designation (*A cooper (inferred resident, unnamed)*) and a
note saying the record asserts a ratio and nothing about any individual. **(2) That the 31 new
inferred buildings stood at all**, let alone where. Their `documented_range`, `position` and
`footprint` are conjectural; the family band they are sized from is type-level evidence about
buildings of that class and is not evidence about these. **(3) The dimensions and positions of
the seven documented buildings.** Their existence, fabric and use are sourced; not one of them
has an attested dimension, and three (`temple_lake_st_building`, `harmon_log_cabin`,
`wright_building_to_let_a`/`_b`) have no attested position either — a documented street or no
street at all.
**What the adoptions do and do not claim.** An adopted anonymous roof keeps every one of its
conjectural gradings; the adoption adds an argued occupant where there was none. It is not
evidence that a building stood on that spot, and the roofs' own liberties (the two anonymous
infill entries above) continue to cover them.
**Heacock's house stands on nothing.** `heacock_house_monroe` is documented — built in the spring
of 1835, moved a block on rollers — and Monroe Street lies about 215 m south of the modelled
terrain box, so the phase declares `ground_contact: outside_modelled_ground`. This is the L40
state again, for one building, and it resolves when a terrain epoch reaches south of Madison.
**What we refused.** No name was invented. No trade ratio is cited to a source that does not
exist: no period trade table for a comparable western town is in `data/sources/`, so every count
is derived from the project's own five calibrations and the arithmetic is written out per trade
in `data/reconstruction/1835_inferred_household_programme.json`. Nothing was graded `inferred` to
avoid appearing here. No inferred household is Native and none is placed among the households
that are.

### L91 — Every dimension of every reconstructed building is a typology, not a measurement

**Decision:** for the **158 buildings this project invented** — the anonymous `recon_*` roofs of
the South, West and North parcels and the `inf_*` shops the occupation census requires — **every
attribute of the building's form is invented**, together with its function, its occupants and
the dates it is said to have stood. Wall height, storeys, roof type and pitch, construction,
cladding, paint, chimneys, doors, lofts, shopfronts: all of it. This entry admits the whole
class rather than listing it, using the class tokens described at the top of this document.

**Why it needed saying separately.** These values were graded `derived` — this project's word
for *reasoned from evidence about this particular thing*. That was a category error with a
visible consequence. A typology from the reconstruction specification is evidence about a
**kind** of building: what a shoemaker's shop in a town of this size and date was ordinarily
like. It is not evidence about **this** shop, because there is no this shop — the building is in
the model precisely because the town demonstrably needed one and no source records it. Grading a
statement about a kind as though it were a reading about an individual is the single most
misleading thing a provenance system can do, and it did it 1,694 times.

**What it looked like from inside the walkthrough.** In the confidence view, 158 buildings that
never existed rendered SOLID — the mark this project uses for evidence — while the Exchange
Coffee House, a tavern Andreas names, whose keeper is known and whose corner is described,
rendered as dithered massing beside them, because its wall height is honestly unrecorded. The
view was telling visitors the exact opposite of the truth, and doing it confidently.

**What is NOT admitted here.** The citation on these values stays, and is not an embarrassment:
an invention bounded by a source is defensible where an arbitrary one is not, and the
reconstruction specification is the bound. What is being admitted is that the bound is all there
is. Nor does this cover the buildings' existence, position and footprint — L81, L82, L83 and L84
already admit those, one token per roof, and they remain the more serious inventions.

**The same distinction, on a real building.** Where an attested building carries a typology value
— the Brown boarding house's wall height, say — the value is graded reconstructed too, but its
note says something different: the building is not in doubt, only the number is. Two records can
carry the same grade on the same attribute for opposite reasons, and the note is where that
lives.

**Three named records are covered here too, and they are worth naming rather than
wildcarding.** `physicians_office` is an invention like the `inf_*` shops — a town of this size
had a physician and none of his premises is recorded — but it was written before the naming
convention settled, so its id carries no prefix. `brown_boarding_house` and
`temple_lake_st_building` are the opposite case: both are attested buildings, and the handful of
form values listed for them are typologies the archetype needs and no source supplies. Their
notes say so in those words.

### L92 — A block of the plat filled in: seven houses on generated lots, and a lot left empty

**Decision:** `blk_randolph_wells` — the platted block bounded by Randolph, LaSalle, Washington
and Wells — stood empty in this dataset and now carries **ten anonymous roofs**: seven principal
buildings, one per lot on seven of its eight lots, and three yard buildings off the block alley.
The block, its ten-roof ceiling and its family mix come from the 665-roof programme's own
schedule. **Everything below that is invented**: which family stands on which lot, which lot is
left open, how far each building stands back from its frontage, and how far it sits to one side
of its lot.

**Why the lots are the improvement and still not evidence.** The three parcels before this one
authored their own coordinates — a row northing and a list of eastings — because the plat module
did not exist when they were written. It does now, so this parcel authors no coordinates at all:
every metre comes from the committed lot polygons of the K7 grid. That removes a whole class of
defect (the K7 slice found seven buildings standing in the middle of the road, put there by a
recipe that had never asked where the road was) and it removes nothing from the uncertainty. The
block face is derived from committed street control; **the side lot lines and the alley inside it
are conjectural**, four lots to a face being a reading of ONE block. So a building here stands on
a generated lot, which is not the same thing as a recovered one, and no lot is numbered: this
project has never read Thompson's numbering off a sheet and will not start by implying one.

**The frontage argument, stated so it can be disagreed with.** The two larger houses (H2, H1)
are put on the Randolph face and the rougher dwellings (D1 log, D2 plank) on the Washington face,
because Randolph is the through street of the pair in the module's own street hierarchy. That is
a typology of frontage value, not a finding about this block, and it is the kind of claim that
would be quietly persuasive if it were not written down here. The three yard buildings — a stable
behind the merchant's house, a privy behind the other Randolph house, a woodshed behind the log
dwelling — are reasons for a roof, not evidence for one.

**The empty lot is a claim too.** One south-tier lot is left with nothing on it. Which lot is
arbitrary; that a block of the 1835 town is not a completed terrace is the programme's own
assumption of alternating vacancy, and filling all eight would have been the more confident and
less defensible choice. The schedule's capacity is a ceiling, not a target.

**One number moved to fit an archetype rather than a source.** The A3 privy's authored eave band
runs 6–7 ft, and the bottom of it is below the height the implemented outbuilding needs to carry
its own door plus a header — the generator is refused by name at 1.891 m. The sample is therefore
taken from the part of the authored band the archetype can build, which puts this privy at
2.07 m, inside its own band and beside the phase-one parcel's privies at 2.05 m. Nothing was
raised out of its typology to make a check pass, and a family whose whole band sits under that
floor fails loudly instead.

**Consequence:** the town gains a block that reads as inhabited on two street faces, and ten more
roofs whose presence, lot, position and footprint a visitor can see are interpretive — flagged
massing in the confidence view, with the reasoning on the building card. The count moves 232 → 242
standing against the 665-roof target; nothing about the remaining 423 changes, and the binding
constraint stays coverage rather than recipes.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for this
block; a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves would settle the lot
lines and the alley, at which point the placements become measurable rather than merely legal.
A named discovery substitutes for a compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total.

### L93 — A second block, nine roofs of the ten dealt, and the tenth refused for being a public building

**Decision:** `blk_randolph_dearborn` — the easternmost block the plat module reaches on the
Randolph tier, bounded by Randolph, State, Washington and Dearborn — stood empty and now carries
**nine anonymous roofs**: five dwellings, one per lot on five of its eight lots, and four yard
buildings off the block alley. The schedule dealt it **ten**. The tenth is not built, and this is
the entry that says so. As with the block before it, the ceiling and the family mix come from the
665-roof programme's own schedule and **everything below that is invented** — which family stands
on which lot, which lots are left open, how far each building stands back from its frontage and
how far it sits to one side of its lot. No coordinate is authored: every metre is read off the
committed lot polygons of the K7 grid.

**The tenth roof was a civic building, and an anonymous public building is a different claim from
an anonymous house.** The schedule apportions this block one I3 — civic or public-service — out of
six in the town. A dwelling nobody named is the ordinary case here: Chicago in July 1835 held
some three thousand people whose houses were never enumerated roof by roof, so an invented
dwelling is a count-unit toward a documented aggregate. A public building nobody named is the
assertion that an institution stood on this ground and left no record at all, and 1835 Chicago's
public buildings are few enough to be listed. The crosswalk had already written the precondition
on its own I3 entry — the six-roof aggregate *"spans unlike functions; they must reconcile to
named public records before selecting construction"* — and this parcel is the first one to arrive
at a slot that precondition covers.

**What made it a refusal rather than a caution is the archetype.** I3 resolves through the
`fort_structure` placeholder, and every building kind that archetype offers is a garrison word:
quarters, barracks, blockhouse, magazine, store, guard, sutler, artillery. There is no word in it
for the adapted office or the engine house the crosswalk says the family spans. Massing this slot
would therefore not merely have guessed at a function nobody recorded — it would have stood a
garrison building in the middle of the platted town, three quarters of a kilometre from the fort
that owns the vocabulary. So the slot is deferred in the recipe with its reasoning, and
`tools/generate_block_infill.py` now refuses all three institutional families by name rather than
falling through the generic *"add a form rule"* message, which was the wrong instruction: the next
run would have added a shape and stepped straight over a precondition the data already carried.
The deferral is gated in both directions — a roof the schedule dealt and the parcel did not build
must be named with its reason, and a slot may only be deferred for a refusal the code states, so
a family cannot be dropped for being awkward and a refusal cannot be used to hide one.

**One anonymous I2 already stands** in the North Division from a parcel written before any of this
existed, massed as a generic frame block. It is recorded here rather than quietly removed, and it
is not a precedent the block generator extends.

**The frontage argument, stated so it can be disagreed with.** The schedule dealt this block no
house and no commercial family at all — five dwellings across the rough end of the range. The
three better-built of them (the deep-plan cottage, the two-room cottage, the one-room cottage)
take the Randolph face and the log cabin and plank shanty take Washington, on the same
frontage-value typology the block before recorded: Randolph is the through street of the pair in
the module's own street hierarchy. That is a reading of the street module, not a finding about
this block. The four yard buildings each stand behind a principal roof on its own lot, because a
rear yard belongs to a lot and a lot belongs to a house — a reason for a roof, never evidence for
one. The barn or carriage shed takes the eastern end lot, where the block backs onto ground the
plat module does not reach: a typology of where a town keeps a large animal shelter, and not a
claim that this lot held one.

**Three lots are open, and only two of them are an argument.** Lots 4 and 5 are left bare on the
programme's own assumption of alternating vacancy — a block this far east of the river read as a
completed terrace would be the more confident and less defensible picture, and the schedule's
capacity is a ceiling rather than a target. Lot 1 is open for a different reason and the
difference is worth keeping visible: it is empty because the parcel refused the roof that would
have stood on it. That is recorded in the recipe's `deferred` list, not as a vacancy claim.

**Consequence:** the town gains a block at its eastern platted edge whose presence, lots,
positions and footprints a visitor can see are interpretive — flagged massing in the confidence
view, with the reasoning on the building card. Standing roofs move **242 → 251** against the
665-roof target; **414 remain**, 86 of them on ground the project has coverage for. The binding
constraint stays coverage rather than recipes, and the civic slot is now a named piece of research
owed rather than a roof that quietly appeared.

**How to resolve:** for the nine, parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence
for this block, and a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves. For the
tenth, the named public records the crosswalk asks for — what civic and public-service buildings
the town actually had in July 1835, where they stood and what they were built of — at which point
the slot is filled by a record rather than by a family. A named discovery substitutes for a
compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total.

### L95 — A West Division block that was already partly built, and four lots taken as read

**Decision:** `blk_randolph_clinton` — bounded by Randolph, Canal, Washington and Clinton, and the
first West Division block the plat module reaches — now carries **seven anonymous roofs**: four
dwellings, one per lot on four of its eight lots, and three yard buildings off the block alley.
As with the two blocks before it, the ceiling and the family mix come from the 665-roof
programme's own schedule and **everything below that is invented** — which family stands on which
lot, which lot is left open, how far each building stands back from its frontage and how far it
sits to one side of its lot. No coordinate is authored: every metre is read off the committed lot
polygons of the K7 grid.

**What is new here is that the block was not empty.** Both blocks before this one stood vacant in
the dataset, so a parcel could treat all eight lots as available and be right. Three roofs of the
phase-two West Division parcel — `recon_1835_west_018`, `_019` and `_021` — already stand inside
this block's boundary, placed from typed coordinates months before the plat module existed, and
**no record of theirs names a lot**, because there were no lots when they were written. Which lots
they occupy is therefore derived here from their own committed footprints rather than authored,
and the three are refused to this parcel: four principal roofs stand on four of the five lots that
were free, and the fifth is left open.

**The invention this entry admits is that those three roofs are read as standing on lots at all.**
They were placed against a density recipe, not against a parcel, so saying that `_019` occupies
"lot 0" is this project's grid speaking about a building that predates it — the lot lines and the
alley remain `conjectural` (K7: four lots to a face is a reading of ONE block), and a footprint's
centre falling inside a generated polygon is not evidence that anybody in 1835 held that parcel.
What the derivation buys is a real constraint rather than a claim: a lot that already carries a
roof cannot be dealt another, so the block's ten-roof capacity is spent as three plus seven and
never as three plus ten.

**The frontage argument, stated so it can be disagreed with.** The deep-plan and two-room cottages
take the Randolph face and the log dwelling and one-room cottage take Washington, on the same
frontage-value typology both Randolph-tier blocks before this one recorded — Randolph is the
through street of the pair in the module's own street hierarchy and carries the crossing toward
the west side. The stable and the privy stand behind cottages on their own lots, because a rear
yard belongs to a lot and a lot belongs to a house. The barn or carriage shed takes the **western**
end lot, where the block backs onto ground beyond Clinton that has no committed street control and
the town gives out — the block at Randolph and Dearborn applied that same typology at its
*eastern* end, and the geography here reverses it, which is the only test available of whether it
was a typology or a habit. None of it is a finding about this block.

**Consequence:** the town gains its first West Division block on the plat, whose presence, lots,
positions and footprints a visitor can see are interpretive — flagged massing in the confidence
view, with the reasoning on the building card. Standing roofs move **251 → 258** against the
665-roof target; **407 remain**, 79 of them on ground the project has coverage for. Three roofs
that had stood in the West Division since before the grid existed are now, for the first time,
counted against the lots they sit on.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for this
block, and a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves — which would also
settle, rather than derive, which lots the three earlier West roofs stand on. A named discovery
substitutes for a compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total.

### L96 — The travelled earth is drawn more strongly than it was, because it could not be seen at all

**Decision:** the opacity with which a street's travelled earth is blended over the prairie under
it is raised. The three traffic classes keep their order and keep the shape of their modulation —
paired ruts up, a grassy crown between them down — but the baseline each starts from moves:
principal graded earth is unchanged at 0.54, ordinary worn earth goes 0.20 → 0.38, and lightly
travelled earth goes 0.08 → 0.28. The faintest point on the faintest street was 4 % earth over
96 % grass and is now 24 %. A separate rule scales opacity up where the ribbon has narrowed to
under two screen pixels, capped at six times and at 0.92, so a street receding toward the horizon
fades rather than dropping out of the picture in patches.

**Why:** this is a correction to a liberty, not a new claim. **L79** already records that the
ruts, the crown, the colour and "the relative amount of bare soil assigned to the three traffic
classes" are visual interpretation and not measurement — and the numbers chosen there were wrong
on their own terms. Measured at the aerial anchor, where a road is unoccluded, many pixels wide
and winning the depth test, the streets changed the rendered picture by **1.1 L\*** at 100–250 m,
with **not one** probe of eleven crossing the threshold of perceptibility. A distinction a visitor
cannot see is not a subtle distinction; it is an absent one, and the visual interpretation L79
admits to was failing to deliver the only thing it exists to deliver. The owner reported it as
roads that disappear in places and are lost from the air.

**Consequence:** the three traffic classes are now legible as three, at a distance and from the
air, and the same reading L79 licenses — principal graded against lesser worn earth, grass
surviving across most of an 80 ft corridor — is now actually available to the eye. A lightly
travelled street reads as more worn than it did, and nothing in the dataset says it should not:
no source states how much bare soil any Chicago street carried in July 1835, which is precisely
what L79 records. The numbers are still invention; they are invention that can be seen. The
sub-pixel rule is a rendering compensation and makes no claim at all — it prevents a road from
being deleted by the arithmetic of its own thinness, the same failure `trees.js` fixed on the
horizon timber.

**How to resolve:** the same evidence L79 asks for — a dated street-improvement specification or
town-surveyor section giving a cross-section and a state of wear. Any such finding replaces these
numbers outright rather than adjusting them.

**Recorded:** 2026-08-14.

### L97 — A block whose standing roofs this project had put there itself, and the third test that let one of them be occupied

**Decision:** `blk_randolph_market` — bounded by Randolph, Franklin, Washington and Market, the
first South Division block of the Randolph row — now carries **eight anonymous roofs**: four
dwellings, one per lot on four of its eight lots, and four yard buildings off the block alley. The
ceiling and the family mix are the 665-roof programme's schedule and **everything below that is
invented** — which family stands on which lot, which two lots are left open, how far each building
stands back from its frontage and how far it sits to one side of its lot. No coordinate is
authored: every metre is read off the committed lot polygons of the K7 grid. One of the eight, the
D3 one-room cottage on lot 7, is adopted as the dwelling of a twelfth inferred carpenter
household; the other seven stay anonymous count-units.

**What is new here is WHO had already built on it.** L95 recorded the first partly-built block, and
the roofs in its way came from the phase-two West Division density recipe. This block's two
standing roofs are `inf_sawyer_dwelling_a` and `_b` — the dwellings of the occupation census's own
two sawyer households, placed from typed local-ENU coordinates by the inferred-residents parcel
before the plat module existed. So the layer that argues who the town held and the layer that fills
its blocks have now collided on the same ground, and the collision is resolved the way L95 resolved
the first one: occupancy is derived from the committed footprints, lots 4 and 6 are refused a
second principal roof, and the schedule's headroom of eight is spent on the six lots that were
free. **The same caveat L95 entered applies unchanged and is not weakened by repetition** — reading
those two dwellings as standing on "lot 4" and "lot 6" is this project's generated grid speaking
about buildings that predate it, and a footprint centre falling inside a conjectural polygon is not
evidence that anybody in 1835 held that parcel.

**Where the vacancy falls was decided by arithmetic, not by argument, and that is worth admitting.**
The programme's alternating-vacancy assumption says a block is not a completed terrace. On this
block both already-standing roofs sit on the Randolph face, so the two lots left free there are
exactly the two the frontage-value typology wants for the better cottages — and the two open lots
have nowhere to fall but the Washington face. Lot 1 is named first because it is the
Washington-and-Market corner and Market is the river edge of the South Division here; lot 5 is
named in alternation with the two built on. Neither choice is a finding about this block, and had
the schedule dealt one roof fewer the pattern would have looked deliberate.

**The third adoption test, which is a rule about the census rather than about this block.** L94
recorded the two tests that decide whether a block roof may be given an occupant: the trade's own
committed argument must call its count a floor, and the roof's family must be one the layer already
houses that trade in. T-A4 met a case neither test covered — a D3 carpenter roof on a West Division
block, when all eleven carpenter households stood north or south — and refused it by hand, on the
reasoning that a carpenter west of the river would be a new claim about where the town's trades
lived arriving as a side effect of drawing a cottage. That reasoning is now the **third test**,
written into the household programme's `method` list: the roof's DIVISION must be one this layer
already houses that trade in. It was checked against every adoption decision made before it and
recovers all four — the T-A2h carpenter and labourer adopted, the T-A4 labourer adopted, the T-A4
carpenter refused. **The invention it admits is the twelfth carpenter household itself**: no source
names him, no source counts him, and the argument that carries him is the same building-rate
arithmetic L83 records for the whole layer. What the three tests buy is that the census cannot grow
merely because somebody drew a roof.

**A trade the tests refuse, recorded because the refusal is not obvious.** The sawyers pass the
first test — their argument says two households are "the smallest number that answers the demand",
which is a floor — and their two roofs stand on this very block. They fail the second, and not for
a reason about sawyers: their dwellings are bespoke `inf_sawyer_dwelling_*` records that carry no
`reconstruction.family` at all, so "the family this layer houses that trade in" has no answer to
give. **Four trades of the twenty-nine** are housed that way and only that way — brickmaker,
packer, sawyer and wheelwright — and eight more are partly so, where the test can still be answered
from the households that do stand on a family-bearing roof. For those four the second test is
silent rather than negative, and silence is being read as refusal: the conservative direction, but
not the same thing. Opened as ROADMAP **K21**.

**Consequence:** the town gains its fourth platted block and its first on the Randolph row's South
Division side, whose presence, lots, positions and footprints a visitor can see are interpretive —
flagged massing in the confidence view, with the reasoning on the building card. Standing roofs
move **258 → 266** against the 665-roof target; **399 remain**, 71 of them on ground the project has
coverage for. Inferred households move 83 → 84 and inferred persons 95 → 96; one more anonymous
roof stops being anonymous.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for this
block, and a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves — which would also
settle, rather than derive, which lots the two sawyer dwellings stand on. A named discovery
substitutes for a compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total. The third adoption test
is discharged by any evidence that places a trade in a division this layer does not yet house it
in; until then it is a bound on invention and not a claim about Chicago.

### L98 — The travelled earth is drawn opaquer at your feet than at range, because coverage only averages at range

**Decision:** within 15 m of the eye the opacity with which a street's travelled earth is blended
over the prairie is scaled by 2.4, capped at the same 0.92 as every other rule here, fading back
to no scaling at all by 40 m. Nothing else moves: the three traffic classes keep their order and
their baselines, the ruts-up crown-down modulation is untouched, no recorded ground cover changes,
and the picture beyond 40 m is arithmetically identical to what L96 left — the harness measures
every band past the fade unchanged to the decimal.

**Why:** an alpha here is a **coverage fraction** — what share of the ground is bare earth rather
than grass. That is the right picture of a mixture only where one pixel spans many patches of it.
At a walker's feet one pixel spans one patch, which in life is either earth or grass, and the
blend paints instead a uniform wash of grass with a hint of dirt in it. The owner reported exactly
that, on mobile, on the dev preview with L96's correction already in: the ruts read in the
mid-distance and the road is simply not there in the near field. Measured standing on a crossing,
2–40 m scored **1.5 L\* with 30 % of probes perceptible** against 3.4 / 87 % in the very next band
out; the same probes with the ribbon forced fully opaque score **3.4 L\*** on mobile and 4.3 on
desktop, so the contrast was sitting in the ribbon's own colour and the shipped alpha was spending
under half of it. It now reads **3.1 of that 3.4 with 80 % perceptible** on mobile, and 3.2 of 4.3
with 60 % on desktop, measured on the published mirror.

**Consequence:** a visitor standing on Lake Street sees earth under their feet rather than a wash,
and what they see there is *more* worn than the same street seen from 100 m away — a gradient with
no counterpart in the world, made by the renderer and not by the record. It is a compensation for
what a single pixel can mean, in the same family as L96's sub-pixel rule, and it is the more
visible of the two because it happens where the visitor is standing. The mean coverage each record
states is still what the picture shows at the range where a mixture is what a pixel means. This
entry adds no claim about Chicago: the numbers L79 and L96 admit to inventing are unchanged, and
this scales one of them by distance from the camera.

**How to resolve:** the honest fix is not a better constant but a textured coverage — earth and
grass resolved as patches at the scale a near pixel can show, so that the same recorded fraction
is what the eye integrates rather than what the blender pre-mixes. Until then this stands, and the
same evidence L79 and L96 ask for would replace the underlying numbers outright.

### L99 — Five invented dwellings on the town's business front, and the two trades the rule let in

**Decision:** `blk_south_water_franklin` — bounded by South Water, Wells, Lake and Franklin — now
carries **seven anonymous roofs**: five dwellings, one per lot on five of its six free lots, and
two yard buildings off the block alley. The ceiling and the family mix are the 665-roof programme's
schedule and **everything below that is invented** — which family stands on which lot, which lot is
left open, how far each building stands back from its frontage and how far it sits to one side of
its lot. No coordinate is authored: every metre is read off the committed lot polygons of the K7
grid. Two of the seven are adopted — the D3 one-room cottage on lot 2 as a thirteenth inferred
carpenter household, the D1 log cabin on lot 5 as a fifteenth labouring one — and the other five
stay anonymous count-units.

**What is new here is the STREET, and it is the largest admission in this entry.** L94, L95 and L97
recorded blocks one street back from the business front. This is the first block this lane has
filled *on* that front: South Water Street was where the town's stores, forwarding houses and
warehouses stood in 1835, and every documented roof standing on or beside this block is one of them
— the Temple Building on lot 0, the Exchange Coffee House on lot 7, J. H. Kinzie's forwarding store
lapping lot 2's north edge, Newberry & Dole's warehouse immediately west and H. Jones's store
immediately east. The schedule dealt this block **five ordinary dwellings, one of them a D2 plank
shanty**, and the parcel built them, because the apportionment is the programme's claim and not
this parcel's to overturn on the day it meets it. **But it is very likely wrong in this particular,
and nothing in the dataset currently said so**: the 665-roof programme apportions families by
DISTRICT and has no notion of what a street was for, so it will keep dealing cabins to commercial
frontage every time this lane reaches one. Opened as ROADMAP **K25** rather than fixed here,
because re-apportioning the schedule is the change T-A6 and T-A7 both turned out to be, and neither
could be done in the same run as a block. A visitor standing on South Water Street in this scene is
looking at five invented dwellings on the town's busiest commercial block, and the invention to
distrust is the family mix rather than the buildings themselves.

**What the standing roofs did NOT do, measured rather than assumed.** T-A7 found Kinzie's store
lapping 9.7 m² onto lot 2, all of it inside the 1.5 m margin strip, and left the lot schedulable.
That was the right call and this parcel is the test of it: the roof placed on lot 2 stands **7.3 m**
from Kinzie's store against a 3 m separation gate, and every other roof here is further still from
its own nearest neighbour. The commercial buildings already on this block did not squeeze it, the
recipe cleared every placement gate on its first run, and no tool changed.

**Both adoptable trades passed on one block, which had not happened since the rule took its third
test.** Rule 6 admits a roof only where the trade's committed argument calls its own count a floor,
the roof's family is one this layer already houses that trade in, and the roof's division is too.
Exactly two trades pass the first test — carpenter and labourer — and this block was dealt a D3 and
a D1 in the South Division, which are precisely the family each of them is housed in there.
Adopting only one, to keep the parcel to a single adoption the way every parcel before it did,
would have been a preference dressed as caution; both were adopted and the rule is what chose. The
inventions admitted are the thirteenth carpenter household and the fifteenth labouring one: no
source names either, no source counts either, and the arithmetic that carries them is the
building-rate argument L83 records for the whole layer.

**Consequence:** the town gains its fifth platted block and its first on the business front, whose
presence, lots, positions and footprints a visitor can see are interpretive — flagged massing in
the confidence view, with the reasoning on the building card. Standing roofs move **266 → 273**
against the 665-roof target; **392 remain**, 54 of them on ground the project has coverage for.
Inferred households move 84 → 86 and inferred persons 96 → 98; two more anonymous roofs stop being
anonymous. **And a third measurement of K20, the largest yet**: inserting two households renamed
**28 of the 84 carried-over inferred households and 32 of the 96 carried-over invented persons**,
against 25-of-94 measured at T-A2h and 17-of-33-touched at T-A5. No grade moved, every `name_basis`
kept its pool citation and `check.sh` re-derives all 98, so this is churn and not a provenance
failure — but a two-household parcel now rewrites a third of the layer's names, and K20's own text
says the fix belongs in its own parcel rather than riding along with a block. It is left riding
along, visibly, for the third time.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for this
block, and a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves. A named discovery
substitutes for a compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total. The commercial-frontage
question (K25) is discharged by any evidence that states what stood on South Water Street between
Franklin and Wells in July 1835 — a directory, an assessment roll or a fire-insurance sheet would
settle it — and until then the family mix on this block is a bound on invention rather than a claim
about Chicago.

### L100 — Six invented dwellings on the business front's second block, and the second roof each trade was refused

**Decision:** `blk_south_water_wells` — bounded by South Water, LaSalle, Lake and Wells — now
carries **eight anonymous roofs**: six dwellings, one per lot on six of its seven free lots, and
two yard buildings off the block alley. The ceiling and the family mix are the 665-roof
programme's schedule and **everything below that is invented** — which family stands on which
lot, which lot is left open, how far each building stands back from its frontage and how far it
sits to one side of its lot. No coordinate is authored: every metre is read off the committed lot
polygons of the K7 grid. Two of the eight are adopted — the D3 one-room cottage on lot 7 as a
fourteenth inferred carpenter household, the D1 log cabin on lot 5 as a sixteenth labouring one —
and the other six stay anonymous count-units. Lot 6, the South Water and LaSalle corner, was
already held by Rufus Brown's boarding house and is untouched.

**The commercial-frontage admission L99 made stands unchanged and is now doubled.** This is the
second block this lane has filled *on* South Water Street, and the schedule again dealt it
ordinary dwellings — including a D1 log cabin and a D2 plank shanty — on the town's busiest
commercial block, because the 665-roof programme apportions families by DISTRICT and has no
notion of what a street was for. The parcel built them for L99's reason: the apportionment is the
programme's claim and not a block parcel's to overturn on the day it meets it. A visitor standing
on South Water Street between Wells and LaSalle in this scene is looking at three invented
dwellings on a commercial frontage, and the invention to distrust is the family mix rather than
the buildings themselves. L99 said it had opened this as a ROADMAP parcel; **it had not** — the
ID it names was already in use for something else — so it is opened here as **K29** and this
entry, not the liberty before it, is the one that carries the pointer.

**What the standing roofs did NOT do, measured rather than assumed, and the measurement is
larger than L99's.** Three documented stores stand on this block's South Water frontage —
Jones's grocery, Philo Carpenter's store and Peck's store — and all three of them stand NORTH of
the lot line, **4.5 m, 6.6 m and 8.2 m inside the platted South Water corridor** respectively.
Jones's and Carpenter's lap no lot of this block at all; Peck's laps only lot 6, which the
boarding house already holds with all 89.2 m² of itself. Not one metre of buildable lot was taken
from this parcel by any of them, the nearest any roof here comes to any of the three is **7.99 m**
against a 3 m separation gate, and the recipe cleared every placement gate on its first run with
no tool changed. **The intrusion figures are a finding in their own right and are not this
parcel's to fix**: T-A7 established that pre-plat records can stand "a metre or two proud" of
their frontage, and these three are standing in the middle of the street. Opened as ROADMAP
**K30**.

**Both adoptable trades were offered a SECOND roof on this block and both were held to one.**
Rule 6 admits a roof only where the trade's committed argument calls its own count a floor, the
roof's family is one this layer already houses that trade in, and the roof's division is too.
Read literally, four of this block's six dwellings pass for one trade or the other: the D3 and
the D4 for carpenters (this layer houses one carpenter in a D4, in the North Division), the D1
and the D2 for labourers (it houses four labourers in D2s). One roof per trade was adopted and
the other two were refused — **a choice, not a rule, and it is recorded as a choice.** Rule 6
opens by saying the family mix is a claim about the TOWN rather than about what has been drawn,
and letting one block's deal raise a trade's count twice is the fitting-the-model-to-the-drawing
the rule exists to stop; but the rule does not say so, and every parcel since T-A2h has simply
never been offered the case. The inventions admitted are the fourteenth carpenter household and
the sixteenth labouring one: no source names either, no source counts either, and the arithmetic
that carries them is the building-rate argument L83 records for the whole layer. The refusal is
opened as ROADMAP **K28** so that the next parcel meets a decision rather than this precedent.

**Consequence:** the town gains its sixth platted block and its second on the business front,
whose presence, lots, positions and footprints a visitor can see are interpretive — flagged
massing in the confidence view, with the reasoning on the building card. Standing roofs move
**273 → 281** against the 665-roof target; **384 remain**, 46 of them on ground the project has
coverage for. Inferred households move 86 → 88 and inferred persons 98 → 100; two more anonymous
roofs stop being anonymous. **And a fourth measurement of K20**: inserting two households renamed
**19 of the 98 carried-over invented persons**, against 32-of-96 at T-A8, 25-of-94 at T-A2h and
17-of-33-touched at T-A5. No grade moved, every `name_basis` kept its pool citation and
`check.sh` re-derives all 100, so this is churn and not a provenance failure — but it is the
fourth block parcel in a row to rewrite a fifth of the layer's names as a side effect, and K20's
own text says the fix belongs in its own parcel rather than riding along with a block. It is left
riding along, visibly, for the fourth time.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for this
block, and a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves. A named discovery
substitutes for a compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total. The
commercial-frontage question (K29) is discharged by any evidence that states what stood on South
Water Street between Wells and LaSalle in July 1835 — a directory, an assessment roll or a
fire-insurance sheet would settle it — and until then the family mix on this block is a bound on
invention rather than a claim about Chicago.

### L101 — Five invented dwellings on the business front's third block, and the name churn that came with them

**Decision:** `blk_south_water_lasalle` — bounded by South Water, Clark, Lake and LaSalle — now
carries **seven anonymous roofs**: five dwellings, one per lot on five of its six free lots, and
two yard buildings off the block alley. The ceiling and the family mix are the 665-roof
programme's schedule and **everything below that is invented** — which family stands on which
lot, which lot is left open, how far each building stands back from its frontage and how far it
sits to one side of its lot. No coordinate is authored: every metre is read off the committed lot
polygons of the K7 grid. Two of the seven are adopted — the D3 one-room cottage on lot 0 as a
fifteenth inferred carpenter household, the D1 log cabin on lot 7 as a seventeenth labouring one
— and the other five stay anonymous count-units. Lot 6, the South Water and Clark corner, is held
by the Chicago Democrat's office and lot 5 by Thomas Church's store; neither is touched.

**This is the first block of the row that arrived with a documented roof on BOTH faces, and it
changes what the frontage argument is being tested against.** L99 and L100 admitted that the
programme deals ordinary dwellings onto South Water Street because it apportions families by
DISTRICT and has no notion of what a street was for; that admission stands unchanged and is now
tripled. What is new is the Lake face. The two blocks before this one had an empty back street to
put their meanest roofs on, so the "best roofs to the business front" arrangement cost nothing to
apply. Here Thomas Church's store already stands on the Lake frontage, and the arrangement was
applied anyway — the log cabin and the plank shanty went to Lake, one of them beside a documented
store. That is the same invention as before and not a larger one, but it is being made with less
room, and the parcel says so rather than letting the pattern look automatic.

**The measurement this block owes its reader, and it is bigger than either of L100's.** Church's
store is seated on lot 5 by T-A7's first test — **59.3 m² of its 92.9 m²** is there against
**33.6 m² on lot 3** — but **22.1 m² of that lot 3 lap falls inside lot 3's buildable inset**, so
a lot the schedule reads as free carries a documented building across its Clark-end frontage
corner. That is the third and by far the largest instance of the case T-A7 measured and
deliberately declined to call occupancy (J. H. Kinzie's store at 9.7 m² and none of it buildable;
`recon_1835_west_018` at 11.9 m²). It is 2.4 % of lot 3's buildable area, so the lot is still
worth a roof, and the parcel does not pretend the lot is empty: the shanty is offset **west** of
its lot centre, away from the store, and clears it by **7.56 m** against a 3 m separation gate.
That 7.56 m is the closest any roof of this parcel comes to anything already standing; the
deep-plan cottage is 20.55 m from the Democrat's office and every other new roof is 25 m or
better. The recipe cleared every placement gate on its first run and **no tool changed**.

**Both adoptable trades were offered a second roof again, and the repetition is the finding.**
Rule 6 admits a roof only where the trade's committed argument calls its own count a floor, the
roof's family is one this layer already houses that trade in, and the roof's division is too.
Read literally, four of this block's five dwellings pass for one trade or the other: the D3 and
the D4 for carpenters, the D1 and the D2 for labourers — **exactly the pair of double
candidacies T-A9 met**. One roof per trade was adopted and the other two refused, on T-A9's
reading and recorded here as **a choice, not a rule**. What T-A9 could not know, being the first
block to meet the case, is that the case is not a one-off: two consecutive blocks have now dealt
both floor trades both of the families they are housed in, which is what a block of five or six
dwellings in this division looks like when the schedule deals it. Rule 6's silence is therefore a
defect rather than an edge case, and **ROADMAP K28** — already open — now has a second block of
evidence rather than a single precedent.

**Consequence:** the town gains its seventh platted block and its third on the business front,
whose presence, lots, positions and footprints a visitor can see are interpretive — flagged
massing in the confidence view, with the reasoning on the building card. Standing roofs move
**281 → 288** against the 665-roof target; **377 remain**, 39 of them on ground the project has
coverage for. Inferred households move 88 → 90 and inferred persons 100 → 102; two more anonymous
roofs stop being anonymous.

**AND THE FIFTH MEASUREMENT OF K20 IS THE WORST ONE YET, BY A FACTOR OF THREE.** Inserting two
households renamed **72 of the 100 carried-over invented persons** — against 19-of-98 at T-A9,
32-of-96 at T-A8, 25-of-94 at T-A2h and 17-of-33-touched at T-A5. No grade moved, every
`name_basis` kept its pool citation and `check.sh` re-derives all 102, so this is churn and not a
provenance failure. But the earlier entries described it as a fifth of the layer being rewritten
as a side effect, and that description no longer holds: on this parcel it was nearly three
quarters. The cause is visible in `tools/generate_inferred_names.py` and is not randomness —
names are dealt round-robin through each community-and-sex pool in a stable hash order of person
id, so a single new person landing early in a large bucket shifts every name after it. The
variance between 19 and 72 is which bucket position the new ids happened to hash into. K20's own
text says the fix belongs in its own parcel rather than riding along with a block; it is left
riding along, visibly, for the fifth time, and this entry is the number that should retire the
argument that the churn is small.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for this
block, and a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves. A named discovery
substitutes for a compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total. The
commercial-frontage question (K29) is discharged by any evidence that states what stood on South
Water Street between LaSalle and Clark in July 1835 — a directory, an assessment roll or a
fire-insurance sheet would settle it — and until then the family mix on this block is a bound on
invention rather than a claim about Chicago.

### L102 — Four invented dwellings and a privy on the fourth block of the business front, and the first block where the "better end" can be pointed at

**Decision:** `blk_south_water_clark` — bounded by South Water, Dearborn, Lake and Clark — now
carries **five anonymous roofs**: four dwellings, one per lot on four of its five free lots, and
one privy in the yard of lot 4 off the block alley. The ceiling and the family mix are the
665-roof programme's schedule and **everything below that is invented** — which family stands on
which lot, which lot is left open, how far each building stands back from its frontage and how far
it sits to one side of its lot. No coordinate is authored: every metre is read off the committed
lot polygons of the K7 grid. Two of the five are adopted — the D3 one-room cottage on lot 5 as a
sixteenth inferred carpenter household, the D1 log cabin on lot 3 as an eighteenth labouring one —
and the other three stay anonymous count-units. Lot 0 is held by Harmon & Loomis's store, lot 6 by
John Bates Jr.'s auction room and lot 7 by the first Tremont House; none of the three is touched.

**THE END RULE HAS BEEN ASSERTED BY THREE PARCELS AS A DIRECTION AND THIS IS THE FIRST BLOCK WHERE
THE THING AT THE GOOD END CAN BE NAMED AND MEASURED.** T-A8, T-A9 and T-A10 each put their better
roofs nearer "the town-centre end" and further from "the end that runs back toward the wharves",
which was a reading of the town rather than a measurement of anything. This block's east end is
Dearborn Street, and the **Dearborn Street drawbridge** — the only crossing of the main stem in
July 1835, a committed structure record whose south abutment stands at the foot of Dearborn on
South Water — is 35.6 m from the frontage of lot 6 and **101.7 m from lot 0**, with lots 4 and 2 at
**55.5 m and 78.1 m** in between. The gradient runs the same way on the back street (lot 7 at
126.3 m to lot 1 at 158.2 m). So the arrangement is still an invention — no source says a better
house stood nearer the bridge — but it is now an invention with a stated and re-derivable
criterion instead of a compass direction, and the lot left open is the one **farthest of the eight
from the only bridge in town**.

**And the frontage half of the same rule meets its first counter-example on this block, which is
recorded rather than argued away.** Three parcels have called South Water the valuable face and
Lake the back street. On this block the **largest documented footprint stands on Lake**: the first
Tremont House at 139.3 m², against 92.9 m² for the auction room, 92.9 m² for Harmon & Loomis's
store and 46.5 m² for Pruyne & Kimball's drug store. A hotel choosing the Lake and Dearborn corner
is evidence about 1835 and the frontage rule is not; the rule is kept because it is a typology for
where *anonymous* dwellings of different tiers go, and this entry says plainly that the block's
own documented evidence does not support extending it into a claim about which street was worth
more.

**The T-A7 lap case has a fourth instance and it is the first that costs the lot nothing at all.**
Pruyne & Kimball's drug store laps lot 2 by **4.66 m² of its 46.5 m²**, and **0.00 m² of that lap
is inside lot 2's buildable inset** — the whole of it lies in the 1.5 m margin strip along the
frontage. Two of its four corners sit 0.70 m and 0.65 m inside the platted lot line and the other
two stand 5.4 m out in the roadway; measured against the corridors it intrudes **5.55 m into South
Water**. Against L100's 22.1 m² inside the inset on `blk_south_water_lasalle`, Kinzie's 9.7 m² and
`recon_1835_west_018`'s 11.9 m², the case now has four measured points spanning the whole range
from "entirely in the strip" to "a fifth of it buildable".

**The offset that answered the last block's lap was measured here and refused, which is the more
useful half of the finding.** T-A10 moved its shanty west to clear Church's store. The same move
on lot 2 buys **0.03 m at 1.5 m of offset and 0.33 m at 3.0 m**, and the 3 m version costs 1.26 m
of lot-line margin; half a metre of extra setback buys **0.50 m** on its own. The reason is
geometric and worth stating once: Church's store stood deep inside its lot, so sliding along the
frontage moved a building away from it, while the drug store stands *in the roadway*, so only
standing further back from the street helps. The cottage is set back 7.5 m and clears the drug
store by **6.83 m** against a 3 m separation gate — the closest approach anywhere in this parcel.
The lateral offsets that remain are ordinary jitter and are described as jitter, not as clearance.

**Five South Division households live in a D5, this block was dealt a D5, and none of them took
it — the first time a parcel has written down why.** Rule 6's second and third tests (the roof's
family and division are ones this layer already houses the trade in) pass for the baker, the
butcher, the blacksmith and both clerks. Every one of them fails the first test, and two fail it
emphatically: the baker's committed argument says one baker is inferred "and only one, because a
bakehouse serves a great many people and nothing attests a second", and the butcher's infers a
single household. Three consecutive blocks have now dealt a D5 and none has recorded the
question; the answer is that test one is doing all the work, and a rule whose refusals are never
written down is indistinguishable from a rule nobody applied.

**A third consecutive block offered the carpenters a second roof and a third refusal is recorded.**
The D4 two-room cottage on lot 2 passes all three tests as literally as T-A9's and T-A10's did.
Held to one per trade again, as a choice and not a rule — but three for three means the case is
the ordinary shape of a South Division block rather than a recurring edge, and **ROADMAP K28**
should be settled rather than collecting a fourth precedent. The labourers were offered only one
roof here (no D2 was dealt), the first block since T-A8 where that question did not arise.

**One thing about the derived occupancy, found while reading it and affecting nothing.** Bates's
auction room fronts **east onto Dearborn** by its own record, and is seated on lot 6, a
*South Water*-face lot, because `tools/plat_occupancy.py` seats a building by the area it covers
and the K7 division gives a block two faces of four lots and no lot facing the cross street. That
is the right answer for occupancy — the lot is covered and cannot carry another roof — but a
reader should not infer a frontage from a lot index.

**Consequence:** the town gains its eighth platted block and its fourth on the business front,
whose presence, lots, positions and footprints a visitor can see are interpretive — flagged
massing in the confidence view, with the reasoning on the building card. Standing roofs move
**288 → 293** against the 665-roof target; **372 remain**, 34 of them on ground the project has
coverage for. Inferred households move 90 → 92 and inferred persons 102 → 104; two more anonymous
roofs stop being anonymous.

**The sixth K20 measurement is the smallest ever recorded, and it is the same mechanism.** Two new
households renamed **7 of the 102 carried-over invented persons** — against 72-of-100 at T-A10,
19-of-98 at T-A9, 32-of-96 at T-A8 and 25-of-94 at T-A2h. Nothing was fixed between T-A10 and this
parcel; the churn is a function of where the two new person ids hash into their community-and-sex
pools, exactly as L101 said, and this measurement is the confirmation rather than an improvement.
No grade moved, every `name_basis` kept its pool citation and `check.sh` re-derives all 104. K20
still owns the fix.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for this
block, and a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves. A named discovery
substitutes for a compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total. The
commercial-frontage question (K29) is discharged by any evidence that states what stood on South
Water Street between Clark and Dearborn in July 1835 — a directory, an assessment roll or a
fire-insurance sheet would settle it — and until then the family mix on this block is a bound on
invention rather than a claim about Chicago.

### L103 — Five invented dwellings and a privy on the last block of the business front, and the block where the two readings of the "better end" point in opposite directions

**Decision:** `blk_south_water_dearborn` — bounded by South Water, State, Lake and Dearborn — now
carries **six anonymous roofs**: five dwellings, one per lot on five of its six free lots, and one
privy in the yard of lot 0 off the block alley. It is the **fifth and last block of the South Water
row**: State Street is the platted town's eastern limit, and the fort's reservation lies beyond it.
The ceiling and the family mix are the 665-roof programme's schedule and **everything below that is
invented** — which family stands on which lot, which lot is left open, how far each building stands
back from its frontage and how far it sits to one side of its lot. No coordinate is authored: every
metre is read off the committed lot polygons of the K7 grid. Two of the six are adopted — the D3
one-room cottage on lot 4 as a seventeenth inferred carpenter household, the D1 log cabin on lot 5
as a nineteenth labouring one — and the rest stay anonymous count-units. Lot 1 is held by the
Mansion House and lot 6 by the Chappel infant school; neither is touched.

**THE TWO READINGS OF THE END RULE SEPARATE ON THIS BLOCK, AND THE PARCEL FOLLOWS THE ONE T-A11
COMMITTED.** Four parcels have put their better roofs nearer "the town-centre end", and T-A11
replaced that compass direction with a measurement: the distance to the **Dearborn Street
drawbridge**, the only crossing of the main stem in July 1835. On the four blocks before this one
the bridge lay to the EAST and the two readings agreed, so nothing distinguished them. Here the
bridge is at this block's **west** end, at the foot of Dearborn, and they disagree: lot 0's frontage
is **36.4 m** from it, lots 2 and 4 are **57.7 m** and **81.7 m**, and lot 6 — the compass reading's
"better" end — is **106.6 m**. The back street runs the same way, **126.4 m** at lot 1 to **161.1 m**
at lot 7. The stated criterion is followed, so this block's best dwellings stand at its **west** end
and the row's arrangement reverses direction for the first time. The arrangement remains an
invention; what it now has is a criterion that can be re-derived and, on this block, contradicted.

**A THIRD CRITERION WAS TRIED AND IS RECORDED AS UNDECIDABLE RATHER THAN QUIETLY DROPPED.** The
bridge is one landmark, so the parcel asked a question with no radius and no landmark in it: where
is the *mass* of documented building, and which lot is nearest to it? The footprint-weighted
centroid of every documented roof in the dataset — **83 roofs, 19,145 m²** — lands at local
**E 939, N 123**, which is EAST of this block, and makes lot 6 the nearest lot at **189.9 m** against
lot 0's **250.8 m**. Excluding the Fort Dearborn reservation — 13 roofs and 10,460 m² of it — moves
the centroid to **E 737, N 88**, effectively this block's west end, and reverses the answer: lot 0 at
**95.0 m** against lot 6's **115.9 m**. So the criterion turns entirely on whether a military
reservation counts as part of the town, which is a judgment and not a measurement, and its whole
spread across the north tier without the fort is **20.9 m** against the bridge's **70.2 m**. It is
recorded here because a criterion that cannot decide is worth more written down than re-attempted
by the next block parcel of some other row.

**K30 gains two more cases and they are on the same street as the first three.** Both of this
block's documented South Water buildings stand in the platted roadway. The **Chicago American
office** (92.9 m²) intrudes **6.91 m** into the South Water corridor, and **Frederick Thomas's shop**
(55.7 m²) intrudes **6.25 m** — so **148.6 m² of documented building on this block's north frontage
stands on ground the plat calls street**. With T-A9's three (H. Jones's grocery at 4.5 m, Philo
Carpenter's store at 6.6 m, P. F. W. Peck's at 8.2 m) that is **five documented buildings, all on
South Water, all between 4.5 and 8.2 m in** — which is the distribution K30 asked for and points at
one street rather than a uniform bias across the grid. Nothing was moved: a position with a source
outranks a corridor this project derived, and K30 owns the resolution.

**The T-A7 lap case has a fifth instance, and it is the largest lap that still costs a lot nothing.**
The Chicago American office laps lot 0 by **10.74 m² of its 92.9 m²** with **0.00 m² inside lot 0's
buildable inset** — the whole of it in the 1.5 m margin strip. Two of its corners sit **0.78 m** and
**0.70 m** inside the platted lot line and the other two stand **6.92 m** and **6.84 m** out in the
road. Against T-A11's drug store (4.66 m², 0.00 m² buildable) and L100's 22.1 m² inside the inset,
the case now has five measured points, and the two most recent are the two that cost nothing.

**T-A11's refusal of the lateral offset is confirmed on a second block and the numbers are cleaner.**
From the committed placement of the D5 on lot 0 — 7.5 m of setback, 1.5 m of lateral jitter — moving
a further **1.5 m** west buys **0.01 m** of clearance from the American office and costs **0.76 m**
of lot-line margin; **3.0 m** west buys **0.22 m** and costs **2.26 m**; half a metre of extra
setback buys **0.50 m** and costs neither. The office stands square across the frontage out in the
roadway, so sliding along the frontage moves nothing — the same geometry T-A11 found, measured
independently. Nothing was moved: the cottage already clears it by **6.79 m** against a 3 m gate. The
closest approach in the parcel is the D4 on lot 2, **7.01 m** from Frederick Thomas's shop.

**The D5 was dealt again and refused again, on the reasoning T-A11 wrote down.** Ten households in
this layer live in a D5 and five of them are South Division — the baker, the butcher, the
blacksmith and both clerks — and every one of the five fails rule 6's first test, two of them
emphatically. That refusal is now a citation rather than an argument, which is what writing it down
bought.

**A fourth consecutive block offered the carpenters a second roof, and the labourers' second-roof
question returned after skipping one block.** The D4 on lot 2 and the D2 on lot 3 each pass all
three tests read literally, and both are refused on the same conservative reading, as a choice and
not a rule. T-A11 asked that a fourth precedent not be collected and that **ROADMAP K28** be settled
instead; the row has now closed with the question open. Of its five blocks, one dealt neither floor
trade a second roof, one dealt it to the carpenters alone, and three dealt it to both.

**Consequence:** the town gains its ninth platted block and its fifth — the last — on the business
front, whose presence, lots, positions and footprints a visitor can see are interpretive: flagged
massing in the confidence view, with the reasoning on the building card. Standing roofs move
**293 → 299** against the 665-roof target; **366 remain**, 28 of them on ground the project has
coverage for. Inferred households move 92 → 94 and inferred persons 104 → 106; two more anonymous
roofs stop being anonymous.

**The seventh K20 measurement is 59 of 104**, against 7-of-102 at T-A11, 72-of-100 at T-A10,
19-of-98 at T-A9 and 32-of-96 at T-A8. Nothing was fixed or broken in between: the churn is a
function of where two new person ids hash into their community-and-sex pools, and five measurements
spanning 7 % to 72 % are what a stable hash order looks like when it is perturbed at a random
position. No grade moved, every `name_basis` kept its pool citation and `check.sh` re-derives all
106. K20 still owns the fix.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for this block,
and a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves. A named discovery substitutes
for a compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total. Any evidence that states what stood
on South Water Street between Dearborn and State in July 1835 — a directory, an assessment roll, a
fire-insurance sheet — discharges the commercial-frontage question (K29) for this block, and until
then the family mix on it is a bound on invention rather than a claim about Chicago.

### L104 — Five invented dwellings, a stable and a privy on the first block off the business front, and the block where the "better end" stops meaning anything

**Decision:** `blk_lake_market` — bounded by Lake, Franklin, Randolph and Market — now carries
**seven anonymous roofs**: five dwellings, one per lot on five of its six free lots, a stable in the
yard of lot 6 and a privy in the yard of lot 5, both off the block alley. It is the **first block of
this parcel shape that is not on South Water Street**, one row back, at the western limit of the
platted South Division against the south branch. The ceiling and the family mix are the 665-roof
programme's schedule and **everything below that is invented** — which family stands on which lot,
which lot is left open, how far each building stands back from its frontage and how far it sits to
one side of its lot. No coordinate is authored: every metre is read off the committed lot polygons
of the K7 grid. Two of the seven are adopted — the D3 one-room cottage on lot 2 as an eighteenth
inferred carpenter household, the D1 log cabin on lot 5 as a twentieth labouring one — and the rest
stay anonymous count-units. Lots 0 and 1 arrive taken and neither is touched.

**THE FACE RULE WAS ASSERTED FIVE TIMES AND IS MEASURED HERE, BECAUSE NEITHER OF THIS BLOCK'S FACES
IS SOUTH WATER.** T-A8 through T-A12 sent their better dwellings to the business front and their
meanest to the back street, and named the front by the street's documented use — which says nothing
at all about a block bounded by Lake and Randolph. So the question was asked of the committed record
instead: **counting every documented or inferred structure whose footprint centroid stands within
25 m of a street's committed centreline, Lake Street carries 12 and Randolph Street carries 2** (and
South Water 9). Lake's twelve are the Sauganash Hotel, the Green Tree Tavern, the Exchange Coffee
House, the Tremont House, the Mansion House, both churches, Hogan's store, Goss & Cobb's saddlery,
Pierce's blacksmith shop, Dole's south warehouse and Philo Carpenter's log drug store; Randolph's
two are the log jail and the Western Hotel. The rule is therefore inherited on a measurement rather
than on a habit — **but the rule itself is still the invention it always was.** No source says a
better dwelling stood on the better street. What the measurement establishes is only which of these
two streets the town's own record treats as the front.

**THE END RULE'S ORDER SURVIVES AND ITS MEANING DOES NOT, WHICH IS THE FINDING.** T-A11's criterion
— distance to the **Dearborn Street drawbridge**, the only crossing of the main stem in July 1835 —
runs **532.2 m** at lot 6, **554.9 m** at lot 4, **577.6 m** at lot 2 and **600.4 m** at lot 0 on the
Lake frontage, with the back street from **576.3 m** at lot 7 to **640.0 m** at lot 1. The order is
the same order it has given on every block, and the arrangement follows it. What has changed is the
size of the difference being ordered. On T-A12's block the far end of the front face stood **2.93
times** as far from the bridge as the near end; here it stands **1.13 times** as far. The absolute
spread of the front face is **68.2 m** against T-A12's 70.2 m — the same block, moved half a
kilometre — so the criterion is now separating two lots that are, in any terms a resident would have
used, **the same distance from the bridge**. It was followed anyway, and the reason is recorded
rather than the result defended: a committed criterion applied where it is weak stays re-derivable,
and swapping to a second criterion on the block where the first stops flattering the answer is how
an invention starts to look like a finding. **At this distance the arrangement is closer to
arbitrary than on any block of the row, and that is an admission and not a defence.**

**K30 gets its first control measurement, on a street that is not South Water.** K30 records five
documented buildings standing **4.5 m to 8.2 m** inside the platted South Water corridor and asks
whether that is a fault of one stretch of street or a uniform bias across the grid. This block
carries the first two documented roofs measured against a different corridor: the **Sauganash
Hotel** intrudes **0.19 m** into the Lake corridor and **Philo Carpenter's log drug store 0.22 m** —
a twentieth to a fortieth of the South Water figures, and near enough to standing exactly on the
kerb line to be inside the plat's own precision. **Two cases are not a survey**, and this entry does
not claim they settle it; they are the control K30 did not have, and they point away from a uniform
grid bias. Nothing was moved: a position with a source outranks a corridor this project derived.

**The block's two documented roofs share one lot, and the occupancy map names the smaller of them.**
The Sauganash Hotel puts **94.33 m² of its 96.0 m²** on lot 0 (67.66 m² inside the buildable inset)
and Philo Carpenter's log drug store **28.58 m² of its 29.7 m²** (19.43 m² inside it). The source
says the shop stood immediately east of and against the Sauganash's public bar, and the two
footprints touch at **0.00 m** — so this is the record agreeing with itself rather than a collision.
`tools/plat_occupancy.py` names the first holder by id, which is the log shop, so **the town's
most-documented building is not the one the occupancy map credits with its own corner.** It costs
this parcel nothing, because the lot is taken either way and the map's job is to say a lot is taken
by something nameable — but anyone reading the derived occupancy table for what stands where will
read the wrong building's name off this lot.

**T-A7's lap case has a sixth instance and it is the only one that costs nothing twice.** The
packer's dwelling seated on lot 1 laps lot 3 by **9.57 m²** with **0.00 m² inside lot 3's buildable
inset**, and lot 3 is the lot this parcel leaves open.

**A sixth block offered both floor trades a second roof, and it is the first that is not on South
Water Street.** The D4 two-room cottage on lot 4 and the D2 plank shanty on lot 7 each pass rule 6's
three tests read literally, and both are refused on the same conservative reading, as a choice and
not a rule. T-A11 read three consecutive cases as evidence that the double candidacy is the ordinary
shape of a South WATER block; this block shows it is the ordinary shape of **a South Division block
of five dwellings, wherever it stands**, so the sample **ROADMAP K28** has to settle is larger than
the row that produced it.

**Consequence:** the town gains its tenth platted block and the first off the business front, whose
presence, lots, positions and footprints a visitor can see are interpretive: flagged massing in the
confidence view, with the reasoning on the building card. Standing roofs move **299 → 306** against
the 665-roof target; **359 remain, 21 of them on ground the project has coverage for** (was 28).
Inferred households move 94 → 96 and inferred persons 106 → 108; two more anonymous roofs stop being
anonymous.

**The eighth K20 measurement is 67 of 106**, against 59-of-104 at T-A12, 7-of-102 at T-A11,
72-of-100 at T-A10, 19-of-98 at T-A9 and 32-of-96 at T-A8. Nothing was fixed or broken in between;
six measurements now span 7 % to 72 % and the mechanism is L101's. No grade moved, every
`name_basis` kept its pool citation and `check.sh` re-derives all 108. K20 still owns the fix.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for this block,
and a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves. A named discovery substitutes
for a compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total. Any evidence that states what stood
on Lake Street between Market and Franklin in July 1835 — a directory, an assessment roll, a
fire-insurance sheet — discharges the commercial-frontage question (K29) for this block, and until
then the family mix on it is a bound on invention rather than a claim about Chicago.

### L105 — Six invented dwellings, a stable and a privy on a block with no front, and the face rule made a command because its first measurement did not reproduce

**Decision:** `blk_randolph_franklin` — bounded by Randolph, Wells, Washington and Franklin — now
carries **eight anonymous roofs**: six dwellings, one per lot on six of its seven free lots, a
stable in the yard of lot 6 and a privy in the yard of lot 3, both off the block alley. It is the
first block of this parcel shape on the row **two streets back** from the business front, and the
first **neither of whose faces the town's own record calls a front**. The ceiling and the family mix
are the 665-roof programme's schedule and **everything below that is invented** — which family
stands on which lot, which lot is left open, how far each building stands back from its frontage and
how far it sits to one side of its lot. No coordinate is authored: every metre is read off the
committed lot polygons of the K7 grid. Two of the eight are adopted — the D3 one-room cottage on lot
7 as a nineteenth inferred carpenter household, the D1 log cabin on lot 3 as a twenty-first
labouring one — and the rest stay anonymous count-units. Lot 2 arrives taken, by Harmon's log cabin,
and is not touched.

**THE FACE RULE'S FIRST MEASUREMENT DOES NOT REPRODUCE, AND THAT IS THIS ENTRY'S FIRST ADMISSION.**
T-A13 (L104, immediately above) chose between Lake and Randolph by counting structures within 25 m
of each street's committed centreline and recorded **Lake 12, Randolph 2, South Water 9**. Those
three numbers cannot be recovered from the committed record under the filter L104's own text states
— "every documented or inferred structure whose footprint centroid stands within 25 m" — and the
filter that would produce them is not written down anywhere in this repository. **L104's numbers are
left standing verbatim, because this document is append-only and was true as written**; what is
corrected is the method, not the entry. The measurement is now a committed command,
`tools/measure_street_frontage.py`, so the next block inherits something it can run.

**MEASURED BY THAT COMMAND, THE ANSWER FOR THIS BLOCK IS NOT CLOSE.** Counting structure records
whose footprint centroid stands within 25 m of a committed centreline, and reporting the three
evidence layers separately rather than merged: **Randolph carries 7 research-layer records and 7
inferred-household buildings; Washington carries 1 research-layer record and no inferred-household
building at all.** Randolph's seven are Newberry & Dole's south-branch slaughterhouse, the log jail,
the Cook County courthouse, both Wright buildings to let, Harmon's log cabin and the Western Hotel.
**Washington Street's entire documented 1835 frontage is the estray pen** — the town's pound for
stray animals. So the three best dwellings the schedule deals take Randolph's three free lots and
the three meanest take Washington. **The rule is still the invention it always was:** no source says
a better dwelling stood on the better street. What the measurement establishes is only which of two
streets the town's own record treats as the front.

**THE THIRD LAYER IS EXCLUDED, AND THIS BLOCK IS THE DEMONSTRATION OF WHY.** The anonymous roofs the
block parcels themselves place stood at **15 on Randolph and 9 on Washington** when this arrangement
was chosen, and read **18 and 12** the moment this parcel built. A face rule that counted that layer
would be reading the programme's own output back as evidence — the row of blocks built along South
Water is the entire reason South Water looks built up in it — and would drift a little further from
the town's record with every block. The tool reports the layers separately and never sums them.

**THE END RULE'S SPREAD HAS THINNED FOR THE SECOND BLOCK RUNNING.** T-A11's criterion — distance to
the **Dearborn Street drawbridge**, the only crossing of the main stem in July 1835 — runs **527.8 m**
at lot 6, **546.1 m** at lot 4 and **584.0 m** at lot 0 on the Randolph frontage, with the back
street from **568.5 m** at lot 7 to **621.0 m** at lot 1. The order is the order the criterion has
given on every block. The far end of the front face stands **1.11 times** as far from the bridge as
the near end, against T-A13's 1.13 and T-A12's 2.93, and the absolute spread of the front face is
**56.2 m** against T-A13's 68.2 m. As at T-A13, the criterion is separating lots that a resident
would have called the same distance from the bridge, and **the arrangement it produces is closer to
arbitrary than ordered.** It was followed anyway, for T-A13's reason and recorded here rather than
defended.

**THE "SECOND ROOF" QUESTION IS NOT WHAT SIX BLOCKS HAVE CALLED IT.** Every block of this shape
since T-A9 has recorded the D4 and the D2 it was dealt as *second* roofs for the carpenters and the
labourers, passing rule 6's three tests read literally and refused on a conservative reading. Both
were dealt here and both are refused again. But the D4 is also the **first** roof of the
**teamsters**, and the D2 the first roof of the **laundresses** — two more of the four trades method
rule 2 argues from the town's building rate rather than from a roof cap, each housed in that one
family and in no other, and each already placed in the South Division. Both pass all three tests,
and **no block parcel has ever named them.** Sixteen anonymous D2 and D4 roofs stand in the South
Division today under exactly that description. **ROADMAP K28** is therefore settling a larger
question than the one it was opened on: not whether a trade may take a second roof, but whether rule
6 admits a roof for a trade that has not asked for one.

**Consequence:** the town gains its eleventh platted block and its first on a row with no front,
whose presence, lots, positions and footprints a visitor can see are interpretive: flagged massing
in the confidence view, with the reasoning on the building card. Standing roofs move **306 → 314**
against the 665-roof target; **351 remain, 13 of them on ground the project has coverage for** (was
21). Inferred households move 96 → 98 and inferred persons 108 → 110; two more anonymous roofs stop
being anonymous.

**The ninth K20 measurement is 61 of 108**, against 67-of-106 at T-A13, 59-of-104 at T-A12,
7-of-102 at T-A11, 72-of-100 at T-A10, 19-of-98 at T-A9 and 32-of-96 at T-A8. Nothing was fixed or
broken in between; seven measurements now span 7 % to 72 % and the mechanism is L101's. No grade
moved, every `name_basis` kept its pool citation and `check.sh` re-derives all 110. K20 still owns
the fix.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for this block,
and a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves. A named discovery substitutes
for a compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total. Any evidence that states what stood
on Randolph or Washington Street between Franklin and Wells in July 1835 — a directory, an
assessment roll, a fire-insurance sheet — bounds the arrangement above, and until then the family
mix on this block is a bound on invention rather than a claim about Chicago.

### L106 — A store and the town's two best houses invented opposite the courthouse, and the adoption tests made a command because two of the last block's three candidacies do not reproduce

**Decision:** `blk_randolph_clark` — bounded by Randolph, Dearborn, Washington and Clark —
now carries **eight anonymous roofs**: a store-residence, five dwellings on five more of its
seven free lots, a woodshed in the yard of lot 6 and a privy in the yard of lot 3, both off
the block alley. It is the twelfth block of this parcel shape, the first to be dealt **both**
of the crosswalk's larger house families together (`H1` and `H2`), and the first block parcel
to stand a **`C2` store-residence** — though four `C2` roofs already stand elsewhere in the
town and `blk_randolph_wells` built an `H1` and an `H2` at T-A2, so what is new is the
combination and not the families. The ceiling and the family mix are the 665-roof programme's
schedule and **everything below that is invented** — which family stands on which lot, which
lot is left open, how far each building stands back from its frontage and how far it sits to
one side. No coordinate is authored: every metre is read off the committed lot polygons of the
K7 grid. One of the eight is adopted — the `D1` log cabin on lot 3, as the twenty-second
inferred labouring household — and the rest stay anonymous count-units. Lot 0 arrives taken,
by the inferred gunsmith's shop, and is not touched.

**THE SCHEDULE PUT THE TOWN'S BETTER HOUSES OPPOSITE THE COURTHOUSE, AND THAT IS A
COINCIDENCE.** This block's west face stands across Clark Street from the public square block,
which carries the Cook County courthouse, both Wright buildings to let and the estray pen; its
east face is Dearborn Street, the street of the only crossing of the main stem in July 1835.
Being dealt the merchant house, the larger one-and-a-half-storey house and the store on that
block reads like the programme recognising where it is. It is not: the apportionment is a
district remainder spread across schedule units by `tools/reconcile_665.py`, which knows
nothing about what stands across the street. **The agreement is recorded here so that no later
parcel mistakes it for evidence**, which is the same failure mode the third-layer exclusion at
L105 exists to prevent.

**THE FACE RULE REPRODUCES EXACTLY, WHICH IS THE FIRST TIME THAT SENTENCE CAN BE WRITTEN.**
`tools/measure_street_frontage.py randolph washington`, the command L105 committed: **Randolph
7 research-layer records and 7 inferred-household buildings, Washington 1 and 0** — the same
14 against 1 that L105 measured on the same pair of streets, from a tool rather than from a
memory. Washington Street's entire documented 1835 frontage is still the estray pen. So
Randolph's three free lots take the better roofs. The rule is still the invention it always
was: no source says a better dwelling stood on the better street.

**THE FACE RULE WAS EXTENDED HERE, NOT APPLIED, AND THE EXTENSION IS THE THING TO ARGUE
WITH.** As committed at T-A13 and T-A14 the rule ranks **dwellings**; this is the first block
that had to place a **store**. The extension made is that a store-residence's claim on the
better frontage is functional rather than social — it is the only roof of the six whose
purpose requires that a stranger can find it. So the `C2` takes Randolph and the `D6`
one-and-a-half-storey cottage, which would have taken that lot under the rule as written, goes
to the head of the back street. **This is an invention about which street a shopkeeper would
have chosen, made by an agent and not by a source**, and it is flagged as ROADMAP K32 so the
next block dealt a commercial family follows it or refutes it rather than re-deciding it
privately.

**THE END RULE IS EXHAUSTED ON THIS BLOCK AND THE REASON IS GEOMETRIC.** T-A11's criterion —
distance to the Dearborn Street drawbridge — runs **318.3 m** at lot 6, **321.1 m** at lot 4
and **325.8 m** at lot 2 on the Randolph frontage, and 376.4 / 378.8 / 382.7 / 388.2 m behind.
The far end of the front face stands **1.02 times** as far from the bridge as the near end,
against T-A14's 1.11, T-A13's 1.13 and T-A12's 2.93, and the front face's absolute spread is
**7.5 m** — less than a third of one lot's 24.6 m frontage. The bridge bears **10.4° east of
north** from the block centre while the block face runs east–west, so the criterion sees only
sin(10.4°) = **18 %** of any displacement along the street: the 49.3 m between the lot 2 and
lot 6 centroids projects to 8.9 m of range, and 7.5 m is what survives. **A criterion that
separates three lots by 7.5 m is not ordering them, it is breaking a tie with rounding.** It
was followed anyway, for T-A13's reason, and the successor question is opened as ROADMAP K31
rather than answered here. On this block a stronger criterion agrees with it — lot 6 is the
block's corner on Dearborn Street, the street that carries the bridge — which is why following
the exhausted rule costs nothing here and is exactly what K31 must not assume elsewhere.

**TWO OF L105's THREE ADOPTION CANDIDACIES DO NOT REPRODUCE, AND THIS IS THIS ENTRY'S SHARPEST
ADMISSION.** L105 recorded that the `D2` its block was dealt passes all three of method rule
6's tests for the **laundresses** and the `D4` for the **teamsters**, both being trades method
rule 3 argues from the town's building rate rather than from a roof cap. Tests 2 and 3 hold
for both. **Test 1 does not.** Rule 6 asks whether the trade's *own argument* states in its
committed text that its count is **a floor rather than a bound**, and neither of those two
arguments contains any such statement — the only occurrence of the word in the laundress
argument is Andreas's *"with the floor covered besides"*, which is a plank floor in a boarding
house. Only the **carpenters** and the **labourers** state it, and they have since they were
written. L105's sentences stay verbatim, because this document is append-only and the
candidacies it named are real under the other reading; what is corrected is the method.
`tools/measure_adoption_tests.py` is committed with this parcel so the next block **runs** rule
6 instead of recalling it, and prints the sentence each verdict rests on. **ROADMAP K28's
question narrows as a result**: not "may a trade that has not asked for a roof be given one",
but "does test 1 mean the trade's own text or method rule 3's list of unbounded trades" — two
readings that disagree for exactly two trades.

**THE `D2` IS REFUSED FOR THE EIGHTH TIME, AND THIS TIME THE TESTS WERE RUN.** Measured by the
new command, exactly one trade passes all three on a South Division `D2`: the **labourers**,
taking a second roof, on the same conservative reading that has refused it seven times before.
The `D1` on lot 3 passes for the labourers as a first roof of its own kind and is adopted. The
`C2`, both `H` roofs and the `D6` pass for no trade at all — the grocers hold the `C2` family
in this division but their count is capped by a roof target rather than stated as a floor, and
the boarding-house keepers hold `H1` and `H2` only in the North Division.

**Consequence:** the town gains its twelfth platted block, whose presence, lots, positions and
footprints a visitor can see are interpretive: flagged massing in the confidence view, with the
reasoning on the building card. Standing roofs move **314 → 322** against the 665-roof target;
**343 remain, 5 of them on ground the project has coverage for** (was 13). Inferred households
move 98 → 99 and inferred persons 110 → 111; one more anonymous roof stops being anonymous.
The eight roofs ship as **flagged placeholder GLBs** — no Blender runs on the improve runner —
so their massing is the archetype's until the nightly bake reaches them.

**The tenth K20 measurement is 12 of 110** carried-over invented persons renamed, against
61-of-108 at T-A14, 67-of-106 at T-A13, 59-of-104 at T-A12, 7-of-102 at T-A11, 72-of-100 at
T-A10, 19-of-98 at T-A9 and 32-of-96 at T-A8. Eight measurements now span 7 % to 72 % with
nothing fixed or broken between them, and this is the second-lowest. No grade moved, every
`name_basis` kept its pool citation and `check.sh` re-derives all 111. K20 still owns the fix.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or surveyed building evidence for this
block, and a reading of Thompson's lot numbering from the sheets themselves. A named discovery
substitutes for a compatible anonymous roof and never increases the total. Anything that states
what stood on Randolph or Washington Street between Clark and Dearborn in July 1835 — a
directory, an assessment roll, a fire-insurance sheet — bounds the arrangement above, and the
block facing the courthouse across Clark Street is likelier than most to have left such a
record. Until then the family mix here is a bound on invention rather than a claim about
Chicago.

### L107 — The town's public square was being offered to invented houses, and two documented ones were already standing on it

**Decision:** the block bounded by Randolph, Clark, Washington and LaSalle — **the public square**
— is withdrawn from the buildable town. It is no longer subdivided into lots, it is dealt no roofs
by the 665-roof programme, a recipe naming it is refused by name, and a gate fails if anything
stands on it that the reservation does not permit. Three structures are permitted and stay exactly
where they are: the **estray pen** on the square's south-west corner, the **log jail** on its
north-west, and the **first Cook County court-house**. Two are not, and have moved: **both of John
Wright's buildings to let**, which were standing on the square and are now on the Randolph Street
frontage of the two blocks directly across Randolph from it.

**Why:** the plat module subdivides every block it can build into four lots to a face, because
that is what the Thompson module says a block is. It has no way to ask whether a particular block
was ever offered in lots, and `tools/reconcile_665.py` reads its output as the ground available to
the town. So the square arrived in the schedule as eight ordinary lots with four free, and was
dealt an `A1`, a `D3`, a `D4` and a `D5` — four invented private roofs on ground the county was
using. ROADMAP T-A16 claimed it as an ordinary block parcel and could not build it.

**THE RESERVATION IS INFERRED AND THE BLOCK'S IDENTITY IS NOT.** Andreas names this block *the
square* and *the court-house square* and puts three of the county's own buildings on it: the estray
pen, Chicago's first public building, on its south-west corner in March 1833; the log jail on its
north-west corner in the fall of 1833; the first Cook County court-house in 1835. This project's own
ground control labels its corners in the same words — `data/traces/gcp/wright_1834_gcps.json` marks
LaSalle and Randolph *NW corner of the Public Square block*. What is **inferred** is the consequence:
that the ground was not for sale, and that no anonymous dwelling may be scheduled onto it. No source
this project holds says in terms that the block was reserved from sale, so the grade is the middle
tier and the reasoning is written down instead — a block carrying the county's pound, jail and
court-house is ground the county is using; the same dossier's own reading of the rest of it is *open,
unimproved, fenced or unfenced prairie block*; and the one further period description of it reached
is water: *"Our public Square was then a pond, where the Indians had trapped the muskrat, and where
the first settlers hunted ducks."* Three readings from three directions and not one of them is a
house.

**THE POND IS DOCUMENTED AND IS NOT MODELLED.** The terrain carries no standing water on this block
and the marsh flora zone is a buffer of the mapped water, so the square renders as dry prairie with
three public buildings on it. That is a second false statement about the same ground, smaller than
the one being fixed and not fixed here; it is opened as ROADMAP T-E5 rather than closed quietly.

**THE OLD PLACEMENT PASSED EVERY GATE THIS PROJECT HAD, WHICH IS THE FINDING.** The two Wright
cottages were put in *"the South Division band the recipes use for ordinary dwellings"* and that
band ran straight across the square. Their placement was tested for clearance from other buildings,
for its own lot lines, for the platted roadway and for buildable ground — every question this
project knew how to ask about a position, and not one of them was whether the ground was for sale.
They stood there from the day the household layer landed. L106, written the day before this entry,
describes the square as the block "which carries the Cook County courthouse, both Wright buildings to
let and the estray pen" and reads straight past it.

**WHERE THEY WENT, AND BY WHAT RULE.** Each building takes the nearest free platted lot that no
committed block recipe has already spoken for — the recipes name their open lots and say why, and
taking one would rewrite a parcel that has already landed. Under that rule building *a* moves **83 m**
to lot 7 of `blk_lake_wells` and building *b* **69 m** to lot 7 of `blk_lake_lasalle`, both on the
Randolph Street frontage, facing the square they were wrongly standing on. The coordinates are
computed from the committed lot polygons through the same lot frame and 5.0 m setback that places
every anonymous roof in the town, not typed. **What is still invented is everything that was invented
before**: the block, the lot, the setback — and now also that the two buildings stood near each other
at all. The earlier record placed them together; the ground to keep them on one block was 200 m
further away and faced two different streets, so the pair is split and the split is stated rather
than the distance being hidden behind a better-sounding sentence. One advertisement offering two
buildings was never a statement that they shared a holding.

**Consequence:** the town loses four scheduled roofs from ground it should never have been offered.
Standing roofs are unchanged at **322**; **343 remain, 1 of them on ground the project has coverage
for** (was 5), because the square held four of the five. The reserved block is reported in the
schedule as `platted_block_reserved` / `state: reserved` rather than as `at_capacity`, which would
have been a claim that the square was built out — the opposite of what the evidence says. The plat
grid drops from 152 lots to **144**: eight conjectural lot lines this project had drawn across public
ground are withdrawn with the reservation, and `lots_per_face_withheld` records what the module would
have drawn so the withdrawal is visible rather than looking like a block the generator failed on.

**The eleventh K20 measurement is 0 of 111** carried-over invented persons renamed, against 12-of-110
at T-A15, 61-of-108 at T-A14, 67-of-106 at T-A13, 59-of-104 at T-A12, 7-of-102 at T-A11, 72-of-100 at
T-A10, 19-of-98 at T-A9 and 32-of-96 at T-A8. It is zero for a structural reason rather than a lucky
one — this parcel inserts and removes no person, so the allocator has nothing to shift — which is
the first evidence in nine measurements about **what** perturbs it. K20 still owns the fix.

**How to resolve:** any statement of the square's tenure — a canal commissioners' plat text, a
county record, a deed or an assessment roll — would move this reservation from `inferred` to
`attested` or refute it outright, and a refutation is welcome: the file is authored data, the
withdrawal is one entry, and `tools/measure_reserved_ground.py` prints what would change. Anything
that gives either Wright building a street or a corner retires the placement half entirely. Until
then the square is empty of private roofs because the evidence says it was public ground, and the
positions of the two cottages remain claimed by the entry that has always claimed them rather than
by this one.

### L108 — A quarter of the modelled land was federal ground or a sand bar, and nothing refused a house on either

**Decision:** two grounds outside the plat are withdrawn from the buildable town. The **United
States Reservation** — the 75.69-acre military reservation east of State Street — and the **sand
bar across the river mouth** take no roof of the 665-roof programme's anonymous infill. Seventeen
structure records stand on them and every one keeps its place: the fort's stockade, parade and
eleven buildings, the garrison garden, the 1832 lighthouse, Col. Jean Baptiste Beaubien's homestead
and barn, and the south pier, which touches both because a pier run out from a shore through a bar
does. Nothing moved and nothing was deleted. The refusal is authored in
`data/reconstruction/1835_no_build_ground.json`, enforced in `tools/generate_block_infill.py`, and
gated by `tools/measure_no_build_ground.py --gate` as a step of `tools/check.sh`.

**Why:** the infill generators test a placement for clearance from its neighbours, for its own lot
lines, for the platted roadway, for modelled terrain and for relief. Not one of those five asks
whether the ground was ever open to a private builder. L107 found that hole inside the plat two
parcels ago; outside the plat it is larger, and nobody had measured it. **32.10 ha of the 121.18 ha
of modelled land standing above the water surface in this scene — 26.5 % of it — is the reservation
(22.57 ha) or the bar (9.53 ha).** Every gate this project had would have let an invented dwelling
for an invented household stand on any of it.

**THE REFUSAL IS DOCUMENTED AND THE BOUNDARY IS INFERRED, and they are graded separately because
they are not the same claim.** Andreas I, scan p. 183 gives the reservation as 75.69 acres, the
southwest fractional quarter of Section 10, T39N R14E. It was unplatted in 1835 — the August 1833
town order has South Water Street pitched only *from the United States Reservation to Randolph
Street* — and State Street was the town's own eastern boundary on the south side, with the
reservation beyond it. It was federal ground under an active claim on the scene date: Beaubien's
pre-emption certificate for the whole of it is dated 1835-05-28 and was recorded 1835-06-26 at
$94.61, about five weeks old on 1835-07-01. Ground the United States has not sold, that carries no
street and no lot line, is not ground on which to invent a dwelling. The bar needs no argument
beyond what it is, and the committed trace already declines to claim any elevation for it at all:
*a bar is a surface a few feet of lake stage moves, no source gives its height.*

**THE INVENTION IS THE BOUNDARY, AND IT IS DERIVED RATHER THAN DRAWN.** Not one vertex is authored.
The reservation's west and south sides are the two survey lines of the fractional quarter, resolved
from a single committed control point — `wright_1834_gcps.json` G1, State & Madison, whose own note
has said since the datum work that it is the *PLSS section corner: sections 9/10/15/16* and that
*Madison's line continues east as the reservation's south boundary* — carried on the plat's
east-west bearing, which Lake, Randolph and Washington agree on to the sixth decimal. Its third side
is the committed waterline whose own name in the trace is *the Fort Dearborn reservation's lake
shore*. The bar is the committed `bar` polygon, unmodified. The tool re-derives all of it on every
`check.sh`, the same discipline `data/datum.json` is held to.

**AND THE DERIVED POLYGON DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE DOCUMENTED ACREAGE, WHICH IS RECORDED RATHER THAN
TUNED AWAY: 65.70 acres against Andreas's 75.69, 13.2 % short.** Three candidate causes and not one
of them measured — a fractional quarter is surveyed to the lake's meander line, which lies east of
the 1834 waterline and encloses the water of the old southward channel; the traced shore carries
+/-20 m because it is drafted off a cadastral plat; and the shore trace's own note says it leaves
its window south of Madison. **So the polygon is a floor, not the reservation**, and the honest
consequence is stated as an assertion rather than a hope: no cell of the committed heightfield
standing above the water surface, east of the west line, north of Madison and south of the main
stem, falls outside the two polygons. The count is **zero**, it is re-counted on every `check.sh`,
and it is the assertion that will fail when T-E3 extends the terrain past the traced shore.

**Consequence:** no invented roof stands anywhere it would not have stood, because none was there
to move — the gate lands green on the day it is written. Every recipe so far has been keyed to a
platted block and the reservation was never platted, so the ground was spared by the order the work
happened in rather than by any rule. What the parcel removes is an answer that was never available:
the 177 roofs the schedule holds in `south_plat_beyond_committed_control` wait on street control
reaching east of State and south of Washington, and the ground immediately east of State is not
coming at any date.

**How to resolve:** a survey plat of the reservation, or the Book of Original Entry, would move the
boundary from `inferred` toward the acreage it is 13.2 % short of and would say where the meander
line ran. A source stating in terms what the reservation permitted would settle the permission list.
The refusal itself is unlikely to move; the boundary is what wants better evidence.

### L110 — A building taken out of the town, and the three public roofs that are all of them there were

**Decision:** the first Cook County court-house **no longer stands in the 1835 scene**. Its record
is kept and re-dated rather than deleted — `documented_range` opens 1835-10-01 instead of
1835-01-01, so it resolves into 1836 and not into this scene — and 331 structures are included
where 332 were. Nothing else moved: no coordinate, no footprint, no dimension and no confidence
grade, and the town's roof ledger is unchanged because the physical-roof reconciliation had
already given this record a roof count of zero on the same suspicion this entry settles.

**This is the first record this project has taken OUT of a scene on evidence, and the removal is
the honest direction.** The record modelled the court-house as complete on 1 July 1835 under a
note saying in as many words that no source fixed a month and that a building finished somewhere
in a twelve-month window is about half likely to be finished by 1 July. It reasoned well from what
it had. What it had was a **caption**: its Andreas citation pointed at "a section headed 'THE
FIRST COURT-HOUSE.' at scan p. 373", and scan p. 373 is a plate, the words printed under
"Copyright secured by A. T. Andreas, 1884." The narrative is four scan pages earlier and fixes the
season, and the chronology fixes the month at November, and a third passage has the county
Recorder moving his office into "the new building recently erected by the county on the public
square" toward the end of October. Three statements, none earlier than the fall.

**The dataset had already contradicted itself about this for four days and no gate reads the two files together.** The physical-roof reconciliation gave the record `roof_count: 0` on 2026-08-12 — *"Production chronology places construction in fall 1835; no courthouse roof should stand on 1 July"* — one day after the structure record was committed standing it on the square, and the walkthrough's own release notes told visitors about *"a courthouse that was not built until the autumn"* while the walkthrough drew it. The reconciliation was right and cites nothing; the record was wrong and cites a caption.

**What is admitted here is a year of a visitor seeing a building that was not there**, on the most
looked-at block in the town — the public square carries the pen, the jail and, until today, a
court-house — and the reason nothing caught it is worth more than the correction. Every gate this
project had asked whether a building was inside its lot, clear of the roadway, on permitted ground
and clear of its neighbours. The one that asks whether it existed yet is the date gate, and the
date gate can only be as good as the range on the record. A range authored from a caption passes
it perfectly.

**Two further claims are now attested and are deliberately NOT applied.** Andreas gives the
court-house the **north-east corner** of the square, in the same sentence that dates it, which
refutes this record's own stated undercut that the north-east description belonged to the 1837
building; and he gives it as **brick**, against the record's invented plank and the reasoning that
brick is excluded before 1837 — a claim that is about the first brick *house* and not about a
county building. Both are recorded on the record as amendments and neither changes a graded value,
because a changed form value stales the placeholder mesh and geometry belongs to the nightly bake.
An upgrade made in the same commit as the correction that took the building off screen would also
be a promotion nobody could see. They belong to the parcel that re-bakes it.

**The scope claim, stated so it can be disagreed with.** The enumeration behind this entry —
`docs/RESEARCH/civic_public_buildings_1835.md` — is that Chicago's public buildings with a roof on
1 July 1835 are **three**: the log jail, the council house and the lighthouse. The estray pen is
public and roofless. Everything else a visitor might expect is either later (the court-house, the
engine house, the market house, the custom house) or was a public FUNCTION carried on inside a
private building (the post office, the United States Land Office, the county's own offices until
late October 1835). That is a claim about completeness drawn from one book, and one book is how
this project knows most of what it knows about 1835. A new source can add a building. What it may
not do is add an anonymous one: `tools/measure_institutional_claims.py` now refuses, absolutely,
any invented roof typed into the worship or civic families, and holds the schools at the one
anonymous roof L93 already records.

**Consequence:** a visitor standing on the public square in this scene sees the jail and the pen
and open ground where the court-house was, which is what the sources describe, and the walkthrough's
researched-exclusions panel gains three guards — the land office, the custom house and the town
hall — saying why the town's most conspicuous public functions have no building. The programme
still schedules six I3 roofs and every generator still refuses them; three of those six are now
known to be a count of nothing, and correcting the number is an owner decision recorded as ROADMAP
T-I3(b), because the two ways of correcting it are two different claims about how many roofs the
town had.

**How to resolve:** for the court-house, a month rather than a season — a contract, a commissioners'
minute or a newspaper notice — and the bake that applies its attested corner and fabric. For the
enumeration, any source naming a public building this list does not have; it arrives as a named
record, never as a slot.

**Recorded:** 2026-08-16.


### L113 — Six researched plants are handed to no renderer at all, and the woody layer draws no flower

**Decision:** six of the 154 species records in `data/flora/` reach **no reader**, and three
recorded July inflorescences on records that *are* read draw **no flower**. Nothing is deleted
and no grade moves — every one of them stays committed, cited and shipped to the browser. The
omission is recorded here, and `tools/measure_flora_reach.py` holds all three populations exact
so none of them can grow quietly (ROADMAP **K44**).

**What a visitor does not see.** Four are the lakeshore's woody scrub — **eastern cottonwood,
quaking aspen, balsam poplar and sandbar willow**, three of them graded `attested` off the
Michigan Natural Features Inventory's open-dune survey and Cowles 1901 — and the zone's own
`reads_as` sentence promises them in as many words: *"a scrub of sand cherry and leaning
cottonwood"*. The sand cherry is drawn and the cottonwood is not. Two are the riverbank's vines,
**riverbank grape and Virginia creeper**, whose `vine_drape` form the manifest publishes in
`forms_unimplemented` — that one is a stated gap rather than a silent one, and it is recorded
here because a published list of unimplemented forms is a note to a programmer, not to a
visitor. The three flowerless records are the **American basswood in bloom** (its record:
*"pale flower clusters on their strap bracts, heavily bee-worked"*, colour and size both
written down), the **ironwood in fruit**, and the grape.

**Why, and it is a routing rule rather than a decision anybody made.** `renderers/web/js/flora.js`
draws five of the manifest's seven roles and fifteen of its forms, over every zone.
`renderers/web/js/trees.js` draws the other two roles, five forms, and **four of the ten zones** —
a `TIMBER_ZONES` list written when the woody records lived only in the timber communities, which
`z08_lakeshore` was never added to. Neither file is wrong on its own terms; the gap is between
them, and it is invisible from either. It is also invisible from the read-set that was supposed to
catch exactly this: K42 measured which FIGURES a renderer reads, and every figure these records
carry is read — on somebody else's record.

**Consequence, stated so a reader can weigh it.** Wherever the lakeshore community is planted it
is planted without its trees — bare sand, marram and sand cherry — which is a claim about the dune
this project's own dossier does not make. (Whether that community reaches modelled ground at all
today is a separate open question, ROADMAP K42 finding 4b; this entry is about what happens when
it does.) In the timber, July's most conspicuous bloom is missing: a basswood in flower is what
the record describes and the drawn tree is plain foliage. And the same routing has one more
visible edge — a plant's `common` name and its July `appearance` sentence are read by `trees.js`
alone, so of 154 plant records the **30** woody ones can be named to a visitor and the **124**
herbaceous ones cannot.

**What this entry does NOT admit, because the measurement refuted it.** K42 reported that *"31
flowering plants record the fruit they carry in July, which nothing draws"*, and ROADMAP K43 was
opened to record that omission here. It is not owed. **29 of the 31 are drawn**, in the fruit's
own recorded colour, shape, size and height on the plant — the cattail's brown spadix, the
dogwood's white berry cluster, the iris's green capsule — because a fruiting head is drawn from
`july.inflorescence` exactly as a flowering one is. What no renderer reads is the **boolean**
`inflorescence.fruit`, which `tools/validate.py` requires whenever `phenology` is `fruiting` and
which is therefore the one part of that record already implied by another field. The two
exceptions are the grape and the ironwood, and both are in the paragraph above for a different
reason than the one K42 gave.

**How to resolve:** three separate repairs, none of them a bake. Add `z08_lakeshore` to
`TIMBER_ZONES` and the four dune records are drawn by the archetypes that already exist. Give
`trees.js` a head path and the basswood and the ironwood get the flower and the fruit their
records describe. The vines need a `vine_drape` archetype, which is a renderer parcel of real
size. Each of the three is a line this entry can be moved to **Resolved** for, and the gate will
demand the bank be updated in the same commit.

**CORRECTION, 2026-08-16 (ROADMAP K45(a)) — the first of those three repairs is wrong, and the
paragraph above is kept verbatim because it was believed when it was written.** Adding
`z08_lakeshore` to `TIMBER_ZONES` draws **zero** stems. That list is a **species table**:
`trees.js` reads those zone files for height, crown width, July foliage, density and confidence,
and then places from a hand-written `COMMUNITIES` mix — a zone's `extent` is read by `flora.js`
and never by `trees.js`. Two of the four dune records (`populus_deltoides`, `salix_interior`)
already take their spec from `z05_riverbank_timber` and the loader is first-zone-wins; the other
two (`populus_tremuloides`, `populus_balsamifera`) are in no mix, so `pick()` can never return
them. The real repair is a **dune community with a placement rule** plus the woody planter's
square carried east over the ground it stands on — ROADMAP **K45(b)**, and see **L114** for the
two omissions that measurement exposed. Nothing in the entry above about what a visitor does not
see has changed; only the sentence about how to fix it.

**Recorded:** 2026-08-16.

**PARTLY RESOLVED, 2026-08-16 (ROADMAP K45(c)) — the second of the three repairs is done, and it
was one step short of what this entry said it was.** `trees.js` has a head path now, and the
**American basswood in bloom** and the **ironwood in fruit** are drawn from their own records:
`tools/measure_flora_reach.py` banks **one** headless flower where it banked three, and the
remaining one is the grape, whose `vine_drape` form is still unimplemented and which was never
this repair's. What the sentence above got wrong is the size of it — handing `trees.js`
`flora.js`'s own `HEAD_OF_SHAPE` verbatim draws `cluster_terminal`'s **1 to 4** heads, a count
calibrated for a forb whose whole plant is one flowering scape, and four 3-pixel specks on a
580-pixel crown is not a tree in flower. The multiplicity that makes it one is **L115**. The
first repair remains refuted (K45(a)) and the third — the vines — is untouched.


### L114 — A researched tree that no mix can choose, and three quarters of the modelled ground the timber layer has never visited

**Decision:** two omissions in the woody layer stay exactly as they are, and are recorded here
rather than repaired, because both repairs are renderer parcels with their own smoke and their own
questions (ROADMAP **K45(a)**, which measured them, and **K45(b)**, which is the fix).

**What a visitor does not see, one.** `data/flora/zones/z05_riverbank_timber.json` carries the
**American sycamore** — *Platanus occidentalis*, graded `inferred` off McBride & Bowles, with
`density_per_ha` **[1, 3]**, a July height of 18–25 m, a crown of 12–18 m, and its appearance
written down: *"Rare, at its northern edge; white mottled bark flashing on the upper limbs."* Its
form is `tree_gallery`, which has an archetype. `trees.js` receives the record, builds a render
spec from it — and **no community mix holds the species**, so `pick()` can never return it and not
one sycamore stands in the scene. It is the only one of the **20** routed, archetyped woody
species in that position. The white bark the record describes is the most conspicuous thing about
the tree and it is nowhere in the frame.

**What a visitor does not see, two.** The woody planting loop sweeps a **fixed square**, E/N
−316..+316 m, while the heightfield S2e carried east runs **E −320..+1700, N −400..+400**. Of the
192,844 heightfield nodes standing above the planter's own dry floor, **52,163 — 27.05 % — are
inside that square and 140,681 are outside it: 87.9 ha of modelled dry land on which the timber
layer has never placed a stem.** `flora.js` builds its lattice around the camera and follows the
visitor over all of it, so a visitor who walks east leaves the trees behind at a line nothing
draws and keeps the grass. That is a claim about the ground east of the town — that it carried no
woody plant at all — which this project's own dossier does not make; `z08_lakeshore`'s box begins
1,084 m east of the planter's edge and describes *"a scrub of sand cherry and leaning
cottonwood"*.

**Why, and it is one cause with two faces.** `trees.js` was written when the modelled ground was a
640 m square and the woody records lived in the communities around the town, so a fixed sweep and
a hand-written mix were both the whole of the world. The ground has since grown to four times the
area and the dataset to 154 species records, and neither literal moved with them. Nothing caught
it because every gate this project had asks a question one step short: `tools/validate.py` asks
whether a record is well formed, K42 asks whether a figure is read by any renderer file, and K44
asks whether the record reaches a reader. All three say yes about the sycamore.

**Consequence, stated so a reader can weigh it.** The town's timber is right where it is drawn —
this is not a claim that the gallery is wrong. What is unstated is the negative: the scene asserts
by omission that 87.9 ha carries no tree, and that the floodplain wood holds nine species when its
own record holds ten. Both are omissions rather than inventions, which is why they are here and
not a confidence downgrade: no attribute is overstated, and nothing in `data/` moved.

**How to resolve:** the sycamore is a one-line mix entry weighted at the density its own record
carries, and it changes the frame, so it belongs to a parcel that runs the smoke — not to the
measurement that found it. The 87.9 ha needs the planting loop's square carried out to the
heightfield's own extent AND a community that can stand on dune sand, because the classifier the
loop already has would read the beach as gallery bank and plant silver maple on it. ROADMAP
**K45(b)** holds both. `tools/measure_planting_reach.py` banks both populations exactly, so
neither can grow quietly and a repair has to un-bank itself in the commit that makes it.

**Recorded:** 2026-08-16.

**PARTLY RESOLVED, 2026-08-16 (ROADMAP K45(b1)) — the sycamore is in the gallery, and the
sentence above about how to weight it was the only part of this entry that needed correcting.**
`['platanus_occidentalis', 2]` is in `COMMUNITIES.gallery.mix`, so the routed-archetyped-and-
selected-by-nothing population is **0 of 20** where it was 1, and the floodplain wood holds the
ten species its own record holds. *"Weighted at the density its own record carries"* is right and
K45(b)'s own worked line — `['platanus_occidentalis', 1]` — is not: 1 is the bottom of the
recorded `[1, 3]` band and **2** is its midpoint, which is the figure `trees.js` would have used
whatever was written, because **the literal beside a species id is a fallback**. `mixes` is
rebuilt at load as `records.density[id] ?? fallback` and `records.density` is the band's midpoint
from the first `TIMBER_ZONES` entry naming the species. **Seventeen of the twenty-six mix entries
are written to one number and place stems at another**; all twenty-six are banked in pairs now,
and which of the two ought to win is ROADMAP **K46** — a question about the ecology, not about
this entry. Half two of this entry — the **87.9 ha** — is untouched and stands.

**HALF TWO IS RESOLVED, 2026-08-16 (ROADMAP K45(b2)) — the planter sweeps the field, and what it
now refuses is a smaller and a stated omission.** The planting loop's `const half = 320 - step` is
gone; it sweeps the heightfield's own extent inset by one planting step, so **189,700 of the
192,844 dry nodes — 98.37 %, against 27.05 % — are ground the loop visits**, and the 87.9 ha it
had never offered a stem to is **2.0 ha**, the one-step margin at the field's own rim. A hundred
and forty-seven stems now stand east of the old square's edge where one did.

**What replaces the omission, because the loop reaching ground is not the same as a wood standing
on it.** Andreas is quoted in `z05_riverbank_timber`'s own note and he ends both divisions'
timber: the South Side belt runs *"east as far as Wells Street"*, and the North Side's *"body of
thrifty heavy growth of timber"* excepts *"the sandy hills near the lake and the marshy places."*
So `communityAt` now carries an east limit per division, read at load from
`data/streets/1835.json`: **Wells Street, E +329.3, for the South Division; State Street,
E +825.8, for the North.** Ground east of its division's limit carries no woody community, which
leaves **64,385 nodes — 40.2 ha — swept and refused.**

**The two inventions in that, stated plainly.** *One:* Andreas names no street for the North
Division; he names the sandy hills. State Street is this project's reading of where they start,
taken from `z09_sand_prairie`, whose relict beach-ridge belt begins at the State Street
break-of-slope that `generators/terrain_gen.py` builds between E +780 and +880 off two committed
ground-control points. A different reading of *"near the lake"* would move that line, and moving
it moves stems. *Two:* the mean easting of a centreline is used rather than either of its ends —
Wells runs E +328.1 at N −400 to +330.5 at N +7 — which is a 1.2 m convention, not a source.

**And the 40.2 ha is still an omission; it is only an honest one now.** `z08_lakeshore` records
*"a scrub of sand cherry and leaning cottonwood"* and carries the eastern cottonwood, quaking
aspen and balsam poplar at sourced dune densities. None of them is in any mix, so the sand carries
no woody stem in this build. That is **ROADMAP K45(b) change one** — a dune community with its own
placement rule — and it is the whole of what is left of this entry.
`tools/measure_planting_reach.py` banks the swept domain (may grow, may not shrink), both east
limits (exact, in both directions) and the refused hectares, so neither the reach nor the limit
can move without a commit that says so.

**AND THAT IS THE END OF IT — RESOLVED 2026-08-17 (ROADMAP K45(b) change one). The sand has
trees on it.** `COMMUNITIES.dune` stands the three recorded poplars on the lakeshore: the eastern
cottonwood in its dune form, the quaking aspen and the balsam poplar, weighted at each record's
own midpoint — 9, 5 and 5 per hectare — over a stand density of **[7, 31]/ha** that is the sum of
those three bands rather than a canopy figure, because ZONE 8 records no canopy and on open sand
the three densities add. **88 stems stand on 4.30 ha of dry lakeshore** where none did.

**Where they stand is the sward's answer, not this file's.** Every other community here is chosen
from the heightfield, and a dune cannot be: what makes it a dune is the substrate. So `trees.js`
asks `flora.js`'s zone classifier — the one that already decides which sward a visitor is standing
in, by the committed extents and their priorities — and plants the dune where the beach is DRAWN.
The 40.2 ha refused east of the timber limits is now **4.30 ha of dry lakeshore planted** and the
rest is `z09_sand_prairie`, whose own record carries no tree at all: its only woody entry is the
bur-oak grub, a `shrub_low` no woody reader takes. That is a stated omission of a different kind
and it is not this entry's.

**One omission does survive, named so it is not lost.** ZONE 8c also records willow scrub —
`salix_cordata` at 15–50 clumps/ha, `salix_interior`, red-osier and juniper — and none of it is
planted: the shrub roles are no woody reader's cohort. The river's point-bar branch is explicitly
refused on the dune, because a point bar is a river feature and ZONE 8a says the active beach is
85–98 % bare sand, *"do not vegetate this"*.

Related: **L113**, which recorded the four dune trees this leaves unplaced, **L116**, the
sycamore's borrowed bark, and **L120**, the dune archetypes this repair had to invent.

### L118 — The sycamore's pale limbs are two invented colours, and the mottling is still not drawn

**Decision:** the American sycamore is drawn in **two bark tones that no source states** — a pale
grey-brown bole and a cream-white upper bole and limb set — because the one thing its record
singles the species out for is a colour, and until now the tree was drawn in the American elm's
dark brown (**L116**, resolved by the same parcel, ROADMAP **K47**). Both hexes are inventions of
this project. So is every other bark, foliage and ground colour in `renderers/web/js/trees.js`;
what makes this one worth its own entry is that it is **conspicuous** — the palest wood in the
scene, and the first thing a visitor will notice on that stretch of river.

**What bounds the invention, and it is three things rather than taste.**

1. **The record fixes the direction and the place.** `data/flora/zones/z05_riverbank_timber.json`
   reads *"Rare, at its northern edge; white mottled bark flashing on the upper limbs."* Pale, and
   **upper** — a sycamore's lower bole is the brown scaly half, which is why one tone would have
   been the wrong repair even in the right colour.
2. **This file's own barks fix the range.** The eighteen bark constants standing before this run
   span `0x332e26` (black oak) to `0x6a6355` (white oak). The sycamore's bole is `0x7a7263` — just
   past the palest of them, because the species is pale wood all over — and its limbs `0xd9d3c2`,
   far outside that range on purpose, since *being the palest thing in the timber* is the whole of
   what the record's sentence describes.
3. **Warm off-white, not white.** A pure `0xffffff` limb reads as painted rather than as bark, and
   the scene's other woods are all warm greys, so the cream is desaturated toward them.

**What is still NOT drawn, stated plainly because the record's word is "mottled".** The tone break
is between the bole and the limbs — one colour each — and the **mottling itself, the patchwork of
cream against olive and grey within a single limb, is not drawn at all.** That needs a second
material or a vertex-colour break inside one stem, which is R-W2b/R-W2c territory. A visitor can
now identify the sycamore across the floodplain, which is what the sentence is about; a visitor
standing under one sees a plain pale limb rather than a piebald one.

**Consequence, stated so a reader can weigh it.** Nothing in `data/` moved and no attribute was
regraded: the tree's presence, height, crown and July foliage remain the record's, and the colours
were never a data attribute — no record in `data/flora/` carries a bark colour at all. The
sycamore stands at 1–3 per hectare on the gallery bank, so this is a handful of stems, not a
repainted wood.

**How to resolve:** a source stating either colour, or the mottling drawn as a break within the
limb. Until then the two hexes stay this project's, and `renderers/web/js/trees.js` says so at the
entry that carries them.

**Recorded:** 2026-08-16.


### L128 — The town pound's fence: six feet, five rails, and not one of them recorded
**Decision:** the estray pen on the south-west corner of the public square is drawn as a **post-and-rail
fence 1.83 m high, five rail courses, posts 0.18 m square at 2.44 m**, closing the same 9.144 × 6.096 m
rectangle its structure record has always carried, with a **1.35 m gateway centred in the north side** and no
gate leaf hung in it. It is drawn by `renderers/web/js/enclosures.js` from `data/enclosures/estray_pen.json`;
`data/structures/estray_pen.json` builds no mesh at all now and remains the evidence record.
**Why:** because the alternative was the roof. **L60** stood for a week over a log box with a shed roof on
it, admitting in as many words that a pound is an enclosure, that nothing mentions a roof, and that the only
archetype which would build a low walled rectangle could not build a roofless one. The enclosure layer built
for the Western Hotel's yard (**L127**) can, so the pen is a fence. That much is a repair. What it costs is
this entry: the pen is now a *specific* fence, and no source describes any fence here at all.
**What bounds the invention, since that is what `reconstructed` means.** The OUTLINE is not new — it is the
committed footprint re-expressed as a perimeter, and its own invention is still claimed at L60. The MATERIAL
is the reading the retired record wrote down against itself: *"THE LIVE ALTERNATIVE IS A SPLIT-RAIL OR
POST-AND-RAIL FENCE, which is what most frontier pounds actually were, and which would look completely
different — open, horizontal, see-through — from what this record builds."* It is a swing from one invention
to the other invention already on the record, not from an invention to a finding. The HEIGHT is bounded by
the use and by the fence beside it: 6 ft, where the wagon yard's is 4 ft 6 in for the reason L127 gives —
*"a yard fence turns a team and does not have to hold a horse that means to leave — that is the pound's
job"* — and the pound's job additionally included holding prisoners for the first months of its life. The
retired 2.4 m was not evidence either: that record says plainly it was "the minimum this archetype will
accept with a gate a beast can be led through". FIVE courses puts a rail every 0.37 m against the yard's
0.46 m, because a fence a calf steps through is not a pound; 2.44 m bays and 0.18 m posts because a pound
fence is leaned on. The GATEWAY keeps the retired mesh's own 1.35 m clear width and its north-side
convention, deliberately, so that this run changes the roof and not a set of numbers restated in passing.
**Consequence:** a visitor crossing the public square sees the town's first public building as a fence, which
is what the sources say it was, and every stick of that fence is invented. The confidence view is the
counterweight and it is wired: every vertex of this layer is graded `reconstructed`, so hiding that level
removes the pen entirely and leaves the corner as the sources leave it — an empty piece of prairie with a
municipal function attached to it. **The ground inside the pen is not drawn**, exactly as at the wagon yard:
a pound's yard was not sward and it is still sward here, because nothing states what it was.
**How to resolve:** a town or county order establishing the pound. Such an order carries a pound-keeper's fee
schedule and often a size and a materials specification, and it would settle the material, the height and the
rectangle together — which is the same document L60 has been waiting for since it was written.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-18.


### L129 — Eighteen garden fences on lots where no source puts a garden
**Decision:** eighteen house lots in the platted town are drawn with a **picket-fenced garden plot
at the back of the lot** — a pale fence 1.22 m high, pales 0.089 m wide with a 0.089 m gap on two
stringers, posts 0.10 m square at 2.44 m, and a 1.07 m gap in the side that faces the house. The
plots are up to 8.53 x 6.10 m (28 x 20 ft), set 3.05 m or more behind the house's own back face
and 0.91 m inside the lot lines. They are drawn by `renderers/web/js/enclosures.js` from
`data/enclosures/town_dooryard_pickets.json`, which is generated by
`tools/generate_dooryard_pickets.py` and re-derived byte for byte by `tools/check.sh`.
**Why:** because the evidence here is a TREATMENT and not a location, and this project had been
using that as a reason to draw nothing. `docs/ROADMAP.md` K5 (a) cites the Kinzie-view plate for
*"picket-fenced garden plots and Lombardy poplars"* and in the same sentence excludes the house
itself from the 1835 scene. So there is a picture of what a garden fence in this place looked like,
and not one word about which lot in the town had one. Under this project's own tiers that is a
`reconstructed` treatment, not a blocker: the plate bounds the invention, the rule bounds who gets
it, and the alternative was a town of houses standing in undivided prairie.
**What bounds the invention.** WHICH LOTS is the part that matters, and it is a rule rather than a
list, stated in the generator's docstring and enforced on every commit: a platted lot in
`data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json`, holding exactly ONE committed building, that building a
dwelling by both archetype and function, with a household recorded as living in it, and room at the
back for a plot that hits no other footprint. Every clause refuses something real — the Mansion
House, Eliza Chappel's infant school and the Temple Building each sit alone on a platted lot and
are not house lots; John Wright's two buildings to let are excluded because their own records say
*"the honest reading of 'to let' is a building whose tenant this project cannot name"*; and five
lots are refused in the record itself because the committed house stands at the rear of the lot,
one of them 7.40 m past its own rear line. THE PERIMETERS ARE DERIVED, not placed: every metre
comes from the committed lot polygon and the committed footprint. THE TREATMENT is the plate's —
close-set vertical pales rather than the open horizontal rails at the wagon yard and the pound,
because a rail fence turns a team and a picket fence keeps poultry out of the vegetables. THE
HEIGHT is bounded by that use read against the two fences already in the dataset: 4 ft, under the
yard's 4 ft 6 in (L127) and well under the pound's 6 ft (L128). The PLOT SIZE, its position at the
back of the dooryard, the pale rhythm, the post size and the gateway are invented outright. THE
PLOT'S CEILING IS INVENTED TWICE OVER, and the second reason is worth stating because it is not
about 1835: a paled fence is thousands of very small boxes drawn in one pass, and 28 x 20 ft is
also what the scene's `light` triangle ceiling will carry. That is the same kind of admission as
**L121** — a number in this dataset settled partly by the renderer's own budget — and it is
recorded rather than dressed up as a finding about kitchen gardens.
**Consequence:** a visitor walking the South Division sees fenced gardens behind eighteen houses,
and no source says any of those households kept one. The confidence view is the counterweight and
it is wired the same way as the rest of this layer: every vertex is graded `reconstructed`, so
hiding that level removes all eighteen and leaves the lots as the sources leave them — houses on
open ground. **The ground inside the fences is not drawn**, exactly as at the yard and the pound: a
kitchen garden is beds and bare earth and a crop that changes with the month, and it is prairie
sward here, because nothing states what was grown on any lot in this town. **And the plate itself
is not held as a source record** — it reaches this repository only as an owner-supplied reference
image with a README, so `existence.sources` on the record is deliberately empty and the citation is
a committed path.
**How to resolve:** a Chicago or Cook County fence ordinance of the 1830s would settle the height
and probably the pale rhythm at a stroke — a lawful-fence specification is exactly what such an
order carries. Any tax, insurance or sale description of a town lot naming a garden or a fence
would turn one of these eighteen from a rule's output into a finding. And holding the Kinzie-view
plate as a proper `chicagology_*` source record would give the treatment a citation instead of a
path.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-18. **Revised:** 2026-08-21 — one sentence above is no longer true and is
kept rather than edited: *"The ground inside the fences is not drawn."* It is drawn now (T-0067),
as short kept green with tilled beds and a path in from the gateway, and it is a NEW invention
rather than a resolution of this one — **L158** states it and carries its own grade. Nothing else
in this entry moves: the rule, the perimeters, the pale rhythm and the plate's standing are
exactly as recorded above.

### L130 — Twenty-four shop signs in a town that documents one
**Decision:** twenty-four of the town's business frontages carry a **blank weathered signboard**
— a plank 0.88 x 0.50 m hung by two straps 0.20 m under a 1.15 m bracket arm, 1.7 m to one side of
the facade's centre and clear of the eave. They are drawn by `renderers/web/js/signage.js` from
`data/signage/town_business_signboards.json`, which is generated by
`tools/generate_business_signboards.py` and re-derived byte for byte by `tools/check.sh`. **No
board carries lettering, an image or a trade device** — L25's decision for the one documented sign,
applied to all of them.
**Why:** because the alternative was a town of stores and taverns that announces itself to nobody.
`docs/ROADMAP.md` K5 (b) asked for *"signboards on businesses — attested"*, and worked strictly
that clause is already finished: exactly ONE structure record in this dataset attests a sign, the
Wolf Point Tavern's painted wolf, and it has hung in that building's GLB since the archetype grew a
`sign` parameter. Every other shopfront in Chicago stayed mute for want of a sentence naming its
board. Under this project's own tiers that is a `reconstructed` treatment and not a blocker, and
AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER says so in as many words.
**What bounds the invention.** THE FACT of a board, and nothing else. What is held: one Chicago
business of these years is attested to have hung a sign; the town's own sources speak of a public
house's NAME as its sign — the Wolf Point house traded *"under the sign of the Travelers' Home"*
and the Exchange Coffee House's later *"Illinois Exchange"* is recorded on its own record as *"a
change of use and of sign"*; and the first issue of the Chicago Democrat, 26 November 1833, is full
of businesses trading under names at named addresses. WHICH FRONTAGES is a rule rather than a list,
stated in the generator's docstring and enforced on every commit: a NAMED record (the archetype
tables' own rule — *never invent business, sign text or goods for an anonymous slot* — refuses
`inf_`/`recon_` slots), a PUBLIC TRADE whose customer arrived on foot off the street, that trade
`attested` or `inferred` rather than `reconstructed`, standing on the scene date, and no sign on
the record already. Every clause refuses something real: Frederick Thomas's shop is refused because
its own record says no source reached says what he sold, so a sign for it would be an invention
resting on an invention; the reconstructed grocery and the reconstructed physician's office are
refused as anonymous slots; and the Wolf Point Tavern is refused because it already has the only
real board in the town. Warehouses, packing and slaughter houses, smithies, cooperages, tanneries,
brickyards, manufactories, stables, the churches, the schools, the court-house, the jail, the
agency house and the fort are all outside the trade list, because their custom came by name and by
cart. WHERE the board hangs is derived, not placed: `docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md` fixes the frame, so the
front wall is the committed footprint's own max-`v` edge and the way it faces is the committed
facade bearing. THE BOARD'S GEOMETRY is not new invention — arm, board and hangers are copied from
`generators/archetypes/log_dwelling.py::_sign`, the wolf sign's own numbers, so the town has one
convention for hanging a board rather than two.
**AND A CITATION IS STRUCK.** K5 (b) offers *"the Green Tree plate's hanging sign"* as its second
piece of evidence. It is not evidence this project holds:
`data/sources/chm_green_tree_1859.json` records in its own `access_notes` that the image has never
been retrieved, that the identification comes from aggregator metadata rather than the holding
institution, and `verified` is false. Nothing here rests on it, and the roadmap box now says so.
**Consequence:** a visitor walking South Water Street sees two dozen blank boards swinging over the
footway, and no source says any of those particular buildings hung one. The confidence view is the
counterweight and it is wired the same way as the fences: every vertex is graded `reconstructed`,
so hiding that level takes all twenty-four down and leaves the town as the sources leave it —
mute, with one wolf sign at the forks. **The blankness is the second half of the honesty**, and it
is the part a visitor is most likely to read as an unfinished model: no wording, device or colour
of any sign in this town survives, the wolf's included, and two dozen invented shop names painted
across the scene would be the most conspicuous fiction in it.
**How to resolve:** a Chicago or Cook County sign ordinance of the 1830s; an insurance, tax or sale
description naming a shop sign; a traveller's account of walking South Water Street; or any
pre-fire photograph of a surviving 1830s frontage actually opened at its holding institution — the
Green Tree plate, ICHi-040230, is the nearest and is unseen. The first of those that gives a
WORDING would be the first thing this project has ever held that could put lettering on a plank.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-18.

### L131 — Goods at twenty-six doors, from an ordinance that gives no address
**Decision:** twenty-six of the town's trading frontages carry **goods on the footway** — 102
upright casks, an empty laid on its side outside the public houses, and 46 packing cases, all
standing 0.55 m out from the wall they belong to — and **one wagon** stands in the Western
Hotel's yard. They are drawn by `renderers/web/js/yard.js` from
`data/yard/town_trade_goods.json`, which is generated by `tools/generate_yard_goods.py` and
re-derived byte for byte by `tools/check.sh`. **No barrel carries a brand, a merchant's name, a
stencil or a mark, and no case is labelled** — L25's decision for the one documented sign,
generalised again.
**Why:** because this one does not start from silence, and that is what makes it worth doing.
`data/sources/chicago_democrat_1833_11_26.json` carries the village ordinances of 7 November
1833 complete, and **Ordinance 9 is about timber, stone, brick, boxes and barrels stacked in the
streets**. A corporation does not legislate against a thing nobody does: that is a tier-1
contemporary statement, by the people who had to walk round them, that this town's streets had
boxes and barrels standing in them. What the ordinance does not give is a single address. So the
FACT is well founded, WHICH DOOR is not, and the answer is a rule — the shape L129 and L130
already use one layer over.
**What bounds the invention.** THE FACT of goods at these particular doors on this particular
day, the COUNT at each, and the objects themselves. The rule is stated in the generator's
docstring and enforced on every commit: a NAMED record (the archetype tables' own rule — *never
invent business, sign text or goods for an anonymous slot* — names goods in as many words), a
GOODS-KEEPING trade whose stock arrived in boxes and barrels, that trade `attested` or `inferred`
rather than `reconstructed`, standing on the scene date, on the TOWN's ground, and a strip in
front of the facade clear of every other committed footprint. Every clause refuses something
real: the fort's provision store and the sutler's store are refused because they stand on federal
ground inside a palisade, outside the corporation whose ordinance is the whole evidence, with no
public street in front of either door; the reconstructed west-side grocery is refused as an
anonymous slot. HOW MANY is arithmetic and not a lottery — one cask per 2.2 m of usable wall to a
cap of four, a case past them at 4 m, a second case stacked at 7 m, a public house's empty at
5 m — and WHERE is derived: the front wall is the committed footprint's own max-`v` edge, and the
goods pile from the end the signboard does not occupy, because `generate_business_signboards.py`
hangs its board 1.7 m the other side of the facade's centre. THE OBJECTS' SIZES are invented and
recorded on the record itself, each with its own note: a 33-inch provision barrel 21 in at the
bilge, a case 1.05 x 0.72 x 0.62 m, a wagon 10 ft by 3 ft 6 in on 4 ft 6 in and 3 ft 6 in wheels.
No hoop is drawn as separate geometry — at any distance a visitor stands, 20 mm of iron is a line
and not a solid.
**THE WAGON, AND WHY THERE IS ONE RATHER THAN TWENTY.** No source this project holds puts a wagon
at any place in Chicago on any day. One place is NAMED for them: `chicagology_prefire278`'s *"In
the rear was the large stable and the yard into which the trains were driven"*, which is the
attestation behind `data/enclosures/western_hotel_wagon_yard.json` and L127. So the wagon stands
in that yard and nowhere else, at a point SEARCHED rather than chosen — a 0.25 m lattice over the
yard's own bounding box, keeping the stand whose least clearance to every committed wall and
every fence line is greatest, which is 8.39 m here. `docs/ROADMAP.md` K5 (c) offers *"wagons/drays
(documented mired on Lake St)"* and **this project holds no source record for that**; a dray
dropped into Lake Street on the strength of a roadmap parenthesis would be traffic invented to
look busy, and it is refused in writing on the record.
**Consequence:** a visitor walking South Water Street passes casks and cases at two dozen doors,
and no source says any of those particular buildings had anything outside it. The confidence view
is the counterweight and it is wired the same way as the fences and the boards: every vertex is
graded `reconstructed`, so hiding that level takes all 149 objects down and leaves the town
standing on bare ground. **The restraint is the second half of the honesty.** The ordinance is
about goods IN THE STREETS, which is the stronger reading; nothing here is drawn in a roadway,
because a cask in the travelled way is a claim about the width of the road as well as about the
goods. And Ordinance 9's **timber, stone and brick are not drawn at all** — they are building
material on a lot under construction rather than a merchant's stock on his own frontage, they
belong to whichever building was going up that week, and this record has no way to say which.
**How to resolve:** the missing fourth page of the Democrat's first issue, which would carry more
of the ordinances and may carry Ordinance 9's own text and penalty; any later Chicago corporation
order about obstructions; an insurance, tax or sale description of a South Water Street lot; or a
traveller's account of walking the street. The first that names a wagon standing anywhere in the
town would be the first thing this project has held that could put a second one in the scene.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-18.
**Revised:** 2026-08-18 (T-0084) — **the tongue is now drawn at an inclination, and the
inclination is invented.** It was drawn as a horizontal box deep enough to span the drop from the
front axle to the ground, on the stated reasoning that a stick's exact angle is not a claim this
record makes; the effect was a 2.75 m pole 0.055 m thick rendered 0.48 m deep, which reads in the
scene as a plank lying in the grass, and the owner read it that way from the Green Tree's yard on
the day it shipped. It is now a box of the tongue's own section along its own line, which puts the
angle on the record instead of hiding it inside a slab: the pole runs from the front axle's centre
down to the ground with its far end resting on the grass, **10.6 degrees**, because nothing is
hitched to it. What bounds that number is the two ends — the recorded front-wheel radius sets the
root and the ground sets the tip — so it is the only angle an unhitched pole of this length can
lie at, and it moves if either of those recorded values moves. The recorded 2.75 m is now read as
the pole's LENGTH rather than its horizontal run, which is what the number means; the tip lands
2.70 m ahead of the body instead of 2.75 m. Nothing about the wagon's sizes changed, and no new
value was invented.
**Revised:** 2026-08-22 (T-0065) — **the "no marks" clause of this entry is superseded by L166.**
Its decision above reads *"No barrel carries a brand, a merchant's name, a stencil or a mark, and
no case is labelled"*; the owner overruled that on 2026-08-18 (*"you can add period correct names
and brands and labels to things"*), and every cask and case on this record now carries a
stencilled commodity word, the house's own brand or a shipping mark. The reasoning above is kept
verbatim because it was the honest reading before he ruled, and L166 states what now bounds the
marks. Nothing else in this entry changes: the frontages, the counts, the placements and the
objects' sizes are exactly as they were.

### L132 — Two river docks, stated in one clause and invented in every dimension
**Decision:** the two warehouses whose records state a dock — `newberry_dole_warehouse` and
`kinzie_hunter_warehouse` — stand at a **drawn timber wharf**: a plank deck 8.0 m across, running
the building's own river frontage plus 3.0 m at each end, its face 6.0 m beyond the traced 1834
bank line and its heel tied 2.0 m back into the bank, carried on a 1.20 m timber crib under the
face and both ends and stepped down to the bed the heightfield gives at each bent, with three
snubbing posts along the face. They are drawn by `renderers/web/js/wharves.js` from
`data/wharves/river_landings.json`, which is generated by `tools/generate_river_wharves.py` and
re-derived byte for byte by `tools/check.sh`. **No vessel, cargo, crane, gangway or name is drawn.**
The two `dock` attributes move from `geometry: "absent"` to `geometry: "simplified"`, which is the
exact claim: a reconstructed wharf of standard form stands in the place of the attribute, and the
attribute's own value — *true* — is all of it that comes from evidence.
**Why:** because the alternative was the river trade that the town existed for being represented by
two sheds standing back from an empty bank. What is held is one sentence and one phrase, and they
are strong: *"Kinzie & Hunter and Dole & Newberry each had a warehouse with its dock along the river
front"* (docs/research/03-structures-north.md §3.10) is the clause that attests the Kinzie & Hunter
building at all, and Andreas independently names *"Newberry & Dole's wharf"* as the place the
schooner *Illinois*, the first vessel through the new cut, was cheered on 12 July 1834 (scan p. 503).
**L66 recorded the consequence of not building it** — `documented` chips over nothing, on the two
records where the dock was the half that made the building worth building — and left it owed. Under
this project's own tiers a dock whose existence is stated and whose size is unrecorded is a
`reconstructed` treatment and not a blocker, and AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER says so in as
many words.
**What bounds the invention.** THE FACT of a dock at these two frontages, and nothing else. WHICH
frontages is a rule rather than a list, stated in the generator's docstring and enforced on every
commit: a sidecar standing on the scene date whose own `dock` attribute is true and graded
`attested` or `inferred` — the last clause refusing a wharf drawn on a reconstructed dock, which
would be an invention resting on an invention. Run over the whole town it selects exactly two
records and refuses every other river frontage in the dataset, including the ones a person would
have guessed at: the South Water stores, the lumber landing, the ferry. **WHERE the deck stands is
derived, not placed** — the wall it serves is the committed footprint's own max-`v` edge through
`docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md`'s frame, and the deck runs along the traced bank's own tangent at the nearest
point to it, which at both sites differs from square-to-the-building by about 20°. **The deck's
HEIGHT is neither invented nor stated**: it is sampled from the terrain along the landward edge at
load, which is T-0001's lesson about the bridge deck, with a 0.90 m floor above the water plane
because a working deck stands clear of its own river and this project's water surface is a
summer-1835 mean with no stage record behind it. **What the invented reach implies is measured and
reported rather than assumed**: at 6.0 m out the modelled bed gives 1.28–1.32 m of water at Newberry
& Dole's face and 1.14–1.29 m at Kinzie & Hunter's, which the record carries as `depth_at_face_m`.
A loaded lake schooner needs more than that, so what this scene draws is a face a lighter or a scow
lies at — the restrained reading, chosen because a longer deck would be a claim about the tonnage of
the river trade as well as about the dock.
**Consequence:** the largest reconstructed object added to this town since the buildings themselves,
at two sites whose BANK is itself disputed or unattested (L66, still open) — so if either warehouse
is on the wrong side of the river, its wharf is on the wrong side with it. Neither deck is a walk
surface: `walkHeight()` keeps its wading barrier over the water, so a visitor sees the wharf from
the bank and cannot walk out along it, which reads as a missing rail rather than as the deliberate
absence of a claim it is. And a wharf with nothing lying at it is a quiet overstatement in the other
direction: these were working docks, and this one is empty.
**How to resolve:** the *Chicago Democrat*'s advertising columns, where a forwarding house states its
street and sometimes its wharf; the harbour engineers' reports of 1833–1836, which measure the
river's depth and may carry a private wharf line; a marine list giving the *Illinois*'s draught,
which would say whether she could have lain at a face in 1.2 m of water or was warped in to a deeper
one; or the c. 1835 view that docs/research/03-structures-north.md describes and this project has
never been able to cite.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-18.


### L133 — Wagons and a bench at the Green Tree, from a drawing made decades later
**Decision:** two farm wagons stand in the yard behind the Green Tree Tavern and a plank bench
stands against its front wall. The wagons' stands, their spacing and their bearing, the depth of
the yard they stand in, and the bench's size and its place on the wall are all invented and
graded `reconstructed` in `data/yard/town_trade_goods.json`.
**Why:** the Trowbridge drawing of this inn — `data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md`,
image 7 — shows farm wagons in its yard and a bench of sitters against its front wall. That is a
TIER 5 pictorial source: a retrospective view drawn decades after 1835, which the brief's own
ruling lets drive **furniture and setting** as this project's third tier and never a coordinate.
So the plate is taken for WHAT stood there and never for WHERE, and where is derived from the
building's own committed footprint. Until today the only wagon in this town stood at the one
address a text names for wagons (L131); the owner's ruling of 2026-08-18 — *"of course there
would be more wagons all over the place in a frontier town"* — is what makes a second address
legitimate, and a picture of THIS inn is a better warrant than the generalisation is.
**Consequence:** three things here are inventions a visitor should be able to name. **The yard's
depth**: nothing measures the ground behind this building, so it is taken to run back as far as
the front is wide — 7.62 m, the building's own 25 ft, which is a bound rather than a measurement
and would be wrong the moment a lot line is traced. **The count**: two, because two is what that
width holds at the 3.2 m a parked wagon is given, not because anything says two. **The bench's
size**: 6 ft by 14 in and 18 in to the seat, read off the wall it stands against. The wagons
themselves are the same invented farm wagon L131 already claims, drawn from the same numbers.
And the people are missing on purpose: the plate's bench is a bench of SITTERS, AGENTS.md's
standing constraint is not relaxed by a picture, and v1 ships no human figures at all — so the
bench is drawn and nobody is on it. Turn `reconstructed` off in the confidence view and all four
objects go, leaving the inn on the bare ground the texts leave it on.
**How to resolve:** the plate identified and held as a proper source record (T-0075), which would
say who drew it and when and how much of it is observation; the lot geometry on Wright 1834 or
Hathaway 1834, which would replace the invented yard depth with a traced line and would settle
this building's larger Canal-against-West-Water question at the same time; or any text describing
the Green Tree's yard, which nothing this project holds does.
**And it contradicts L131 in writing, which is why this is a new entry rather than an edit.**
L131 says the first source *naming* a wagon standing anywhere in the town "would be the first thing
this project has held that could put a second one in the scene". That was written the same day and
it is too strong: it counts texts and not pictures, and a retrospective drawing of one named inn
showing wagons in that inn's yard is evidence about that yard in a way a general text about the
town would not be. L131's own claim stands and its wagon has not moved; what has changed is the
bar, and the bar moved because the owner moved it.

### L134 — A wagon shed at the Green Tree, and the covered wagon standing in it
**Decision:** an open-sided wagon shed stands against the north side wall of the Green Tree
Tavern with a covered wagon under it. The wall it is attached to, the bay it covers, its two
plate heights, the fall between them, the section of its posts and plates, and the tilt's rise
and overhang are all invented and graded `reconstructed` in `data/yard/town_trade_goods.json`.
**Why:** the Trowbridge drawing of this inn — `data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md`,
image 7 — shows an **open-sided wagon shed attached at the left of the house with a covered
wagon standing under it**. That is a TIER 5 pictorial source on the ruling L133 already applied
to the same plate: it may drive furniture and setting and it may never drive a coordinate. So
the shed is taken from the picture and its stand is derived from the building's own committed
footprint. Neither a shed nor a tilt existed anywhere in this renderer before; the owner's
ruling of 2026-08-18 — *"you are totally fine to be liberal with adding reconstructed items
when i ask for things, you can just label and mark them as such"* — is the warrant for building
one rather than filing the ask.
**Consequence:** four things here are inventions a visitor should be able to name. **Which
wall.** The plate's word is "left", which describes a viewpoint rather than a building, so it is
read as the end away from the streets: the placement record puts the front on Canal and the long
side on Lake, T-0080's two wagons already stand off the rear wall, and the north side wall is
the only one of the four that is neither a street frontage nor occupied. Three committed facts
agree, and not one of them is the plate. **It is not a gable, and the entry says so rather than
letting the word pass.** `frame_tavern` lays this building's ridge along its longer axis, which
puts its gables on the front and the rear and makes the north wall an eaves wall — so the shed
stands at the left END of the elevation and not at a gable. Correcting the fabric to the three
views is bake-gated and is T-0083's; this entry does not pre-empt it. **How big.** The bay is
the wagon's own 3.05 m body with half a metre of air at each end by the 3.20 m of ground a
parked wagon is already given, the open eave stands a hand's breadth over the tilt it has to
cover, and the roof falls 12 degrees — every one of those a bound rather than a measurement.
**The tilt.** Canvas on bows, 1.10 m of rise, open at both ends; the bows are not drawn for the
reason the barrels' hoops are not, and the canvas tone is chosen weathered rather than white
because white duck at noon would be the brightest thing in the town. Turn `reconstructed` off in
the confidence view and the whole shed and its wagon go with the rest of the layer.
**What this is NOT:** the low one-storey additions John Gray describes at each end of this house
(`green_tree_tavern.attributes.side_additions`, `inferred`, `geometry: absent`). Those are
attributes of the BUILDING, described three to six years after the scene date and deliberately
excluded from its footprint for that reason. This is a yard structure on the yard's own ground,
it does not date them, and it must not be read as having built them.
**How to resolve:** the plate identified and held as a proper source record (T-0075), which
would say who drew it and when and how much of it is observation; the lot geometry on Wright
1834 or Hathaway 1834, which would replace the invented yard with a traced line; or the fabric
pass at T-0083, which would settle where this building's gables actually are and may move the
shed to one of them.

### L135 — The Green Tree's frontage: plank walks nobody recorded, and the first lettering this project has drawn
**Decision:** the Green Tree Tavern's two street walls carry a **plank walk** 1.83 m wide laid
0.20 m off the wall, its deck 0.11 m over the ground on 55 mm boards at a 0.26 m pitch; a **board
crossing** 1.22 m wide and four boards laid the way a foot travels runs from that walk across
Canal Street and 0.6 m past the far edge of the travelled track; and a **3.60 m post** with a
1.55 m cross-arm stands at the Lake-and-Canal corner, 2.93 m out from each of the two walls, with
a 1.30 x 0.55 m board hanging under the arm **lettered GREEN TREE**. All of it is drawn by
`renderers/web/js/frontage.js` from `data/frontage/green_tree_frontage.json`, which
`tools/generate_frontage_works.py` derives and `tools/check.sh` re-derives byte for byte.
**Why:** two of the owner's reference views of this inn describe the ground in front of it, and
`data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md` records them verbatim — image 6, the
Braunhold engraving of 1838: *"post-mounted hanging signboard at the corner; plank sidewalks with
board crossings"*; image 7, the Trowbridge drawing: *"the hanging 'GREEN TREE' sign on its post"*.
Both are tier-5 pictorial and retrospective, so they may drive setting and may never drive a
coordinate. WHERE everything stands is therefore derived from three committed things — the
footprint, the placement, and the street's own travelled-track half-width out of
`data/streets/1835.json` — and a wall with no street outward of it, or a walk that would lie in the
travelled way, is refused in writing rather than nudged. Two of the four walls are refused here for
exactly that reason.
**What bounds the invention, and it is split in two.** THE FACT of a walk, a crossing and a board
on a post at this inn is the plates'. Every DIMENSION is invented: nothing in this project measures
a Chicago sidewalk of 1835, so 6 ft is two people passing and the rest is ordinary sawn stock. And
that a walk stood on this ground at noon on 1 July 1835 is invented, the same claim L133 and L134
make for the wagons and the shed beside it.
**THE LETTERING, which is the part that needed arguing rather than deriving.** L25 leaves the
town's one documented board blank, and L130 leaves twenty-four more blank on the same reasoning.
**That reasoning does not reach this board.** L25's subject is an IMAGE nobody has described — no
source says how the wolf was painted, and a wolf drawn from imagination would be the most
conspicuous invention in the scene. This board's subject is a NAME; image 7 states it in as many
words; and the name is already committed on `data/structures/green_tree_tavern.json`. Leaving it
blank would not be caution, it would be discarding evidence the project holds, which is the
reading AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER exists to refuse. So the WORDING is graded `inferred`
against the plate and drawn, and what stays invented and is claimed here is the **letterform**: a
serif face, its size fitted to a board whose width is itself derived, its spacing, its dark-brown
paint and the absence of any wear on it. No other board in the town is lettered, because nothing
states what any of them said.
**Consequence:** `tools/generate_business_signboards.py` now REFUSES this frontage in writing
(clause 6) rather than also hanging a blank board on its wall. The plates show one board at this
inn and it is on a post, so the town no longer draws the same claim twice — and the refusal is
visible in `data/signage/town_business_signboards.json` rather than being a silent omission. The
count of blank business boards falls from twenty-four to twenty-three, which is what L130's own
title should now be read against.
**How to resolve:** a Chicago town order on sidewalks — the corporation legislated wooden walks
within a few years of 1835, and an order of the right date would give a width and a material at a
stroke; any tax, insurance or sale description naming a walk in front of a lot; or holding the
Braunhold and Trowbridge plates as proper source records (T-0075), which would turn the committed
path this entry cites into a `source_id` and the lettering's warrant into a citation.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-18.
**Amended 2026-09-03 — this walk is held between STRING PIECES (T-0460).** The one renderer that draws every plank walk in this project now lays a 0.09 m edge timber down each side of one, its top flush with the boards and its foot in the ground, taking the outermost 0.09 m of the walk's own width so nothing widens. It replaces a row of board ENDS at the walk's edge, which is what the owner reported as a jagged sawtooth where the boards met the dirt. **The invention this adds — that these walks had edge timbers at all — is argued in full at L160**, and it is the same class as the width, the rise and the plank pitch this entry already claims.


### L136 — The Sauganash's frontage: two more plank walks, a crossing, and two posts nobody measured
**Decision:** the Sauganash Hotel's two street walls carry a **plank walk** 1.83 m wide laid
0.20 m off the wall, its deck 0.11 m over the ground on 55 mm boards at a 0.26 m pitch; a **board
crossing** 1.22 m wide and four boards laid the way a foot travels runs from the Lake Street walk
15.87 m across the road and 0.6 m past the far edge of the travelled track; and **two hitching
posts** 1.30 m tall and 0.16 m square, under a 0.22 m capped head, stand in the verge 0.90 m
beyond the outer edge of the front walk, at 0.28 and 0.72 of the frontage's own length. All of it
is drawn by `renderers/web/js/frontage.js` from `data/frontage/sauganash_frontage.json`, which
`tools/generate_frontage_works.py` derives and `tools/check.sh` re-derives byte for byte. Every
dimension above is the same one L135 claims at the Green Tree; what is new here is the two posts,
which are this project's first piece of horse furniture.
**Why:** three of the owner's reference views of this hotel describe the ground in front of it,
and `data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md` records them verbatim — image 8, the
Petford watercolour of 1831: *"plank sidewalk with a board crossing over the road; two posts
(hitching/corner posts) at the road edge"*; image 9, the Braunhold engraving: *"plank walks on
both frontages, hitching posts"*; image 10, the Trowbridge drawing, which ties a saddled horse to
one of them. All three are tier-5 pictorial and retrospective, so they may drive setting and may
never drive a coordinate. WHERE everything stands is therefore derived from the same three
committed things L135 names — the footprint, the placement, and the street's own travelled-track
half-width out of `data/streets/1835.json` — and two of the four walls are refused in writing.
**What bounds the invention.** THE FACT of walks, a crossing and posts at this hotel is the
plates'. Every DIMENSION is invented, including the two posts' height and section and the capped
head, which no plate resolves and no town order ever will. That there were TWO of them and no
more is image 8's; WHERE along the frontage they stand is the rule's — the thirds, because a post
at the very corner would stand on the ground L135's sign post occupies at the other inn and a post
at the middle would stand in front of the door. And that any of it stood on this ground at noon on
1 July 1835 is invented, the same claim L135 makes a block away.
**THE HORSE IS NOT DRAWN.** Image 10's saddled horse is reference for use and scale only. The
standing L1 constraint is about people; the reason this one is left out is narrower and is stated
here so it is not mistaken for the same rule: nothing in this project models an animal, and a
horse invented at the one post that has a plate behind it would be the most conspicuous
reconstruction in the town.
**NOTHING HERE IS LETTERED, and that is a reading rather than an omission.** L135 letters the
Green Tree's board because image 7 states the wording. None of this hotel's three views shows a
name board at all — the posts they show are hitching posts — so the Sauganash keeps the blank wall
board `tools/generate_business_signboards.py` hangs on it by rule (L130), the frontage layer draws
no board here, and clause 6 of that generator is NOT extended to this building. The record's
`board_on_a_post` block carries that argument on its own face.
**Consequence for the rule itself, and it is the reason a second building was worth doing.** The
walk rule asked only that a street lie *outward* of a wall. The Sauganash's east wall is a flank
in the middle of its block, and Lake Street's centreline — which crosses the far END of it —
stood 0.13 m outward out of 16.00 m, enough to pass. The rule now also asks that the street lie
IN FRONT of the wall rather than beside it: at least half the distance to it standing outward, a
60-degree cone. Every real frontage at both buildings clears that by 0.998 or better; the flank
measured 0.008. The Green Tree's own walks, crossing, post and refusals are unchanged to the byte.
**How to resolve:** as L135 — a Chicago town order on sidewalks, a tax or sale description naming
a walk in front of this lot, or holding the Petford, Braunhold and Trowbridge plates as proper
source records (T-0075), which would turn the committed path this entry cites into a `source_id`.
None of those would ever give the posts their dimensions.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-18.

### L137 — The far sward is an aggregate, and its height is the tallest plants in the patch
**Decision:** past the detailed rings the sward is drawn as **`flora-far`, a band of clump cards
standing for ground rather than for plants** (`renderers/web/js/flora.js`, `rebuildFar`). Each card
is dealt a species off the community's own recorded weights, and then drawn at a height taken from
the **upper half** of that species' recorded range and multiplied by **1.14** in the near band and
**1.20** in the deep one, at a width of **1.4–4.6 m** depending on the band and the detail level.
Nothing in the records states any of those five numbers, and no record could: a species record
gives the height of a PLANT and this is the silhouette of a patch of them.
**Why:** what an aggregate shows against the sky is not the mean of a stand, it is the tallest
plants in it — the short ones stand behind the tall ones and are hidden by them. Drawing the mean
put the far field visibly LOWER than the detailed sward it hands over to, which is a seam where
there should be none. The two lift factors and the widths are what closed that seam at the
crossover; they were chosen by eye at the two stands the owner reported (South Water at 084° and
Wells at 185°) and by nothing else.
**What is NOT invented here.** The species, the colour and the recorded height RANGE the draw is
taken from are the community's own compiled records, dealt by the same `dealt` call the mid ring
uses, so a far card is never a plant the community does not carry and never a colour the palette
does not give it. And the card is ROOTED: it stands on `terrain.surfaceHeight` at a station
`station()` allows, so it obeys the same footprints, the same travelled track and the same
waterline every other plant in this renderer obeys.
**Consequence:** a photograph of the far field is not a measurement of the far field. The band's
population is deliberately **excluded from the drawn census** (`stats.draws`) for that reason — a
card is not a stem and counting it as one would inflate every community's matrix count by the area
of an annulus four times the size of the ring the census is about.
**How to resolve:** nothing about 1835 would resolve it, because it is a drawing decision and not a
claim. What would retire it is a far-field representation that carries the recorded stand instead
of standing in for it — the same shape of answer L32's tuft bundle is waiting on.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-18.


### L138 — The wagons' running gear: every timber between box and axles is invented
**Decision:** each farm wagon on the yard layer is now drawn with a **bolster over each axle**, a
**reach** (coupling pole) tying the rear axle forward to the front gear, **two hounds** bracketing
that reach and running on past the front axle to the tongue's root, and a **kingbolt** through
bolster, hounds and axle (`renderers/web/js/yard.js`, `buildWagon`). Six timbers, none of them in
any source this project holds, all graded `reconstructed`.
**Why:** until now there was nothing at all between the box and the axles. The floor sits at
0.95 m, the rear axle at 0.685 m and the front at 0.535 m, so the box hovered **0.27 m above one
axle and 0.42 m above the other**, carried by air, and the two axles were not joined to each other
by anything. The owner read it from the Green Tree's yard on 2026-08-18 — *"it looks like that bar
is supposed to be below the carriage of the wagon holding the wheels together but not sure. all the
wagons seem off"* — and the bar he had found was the tongue (T-0084), because the member he was
looking for did not exist. A wagon with no running gear is not a simplification of a wagon; it is a
different object.
**What bounds the invention, and it bounds it tightly.** Only the six SECTIONS are free numbers —
a bolster 0.11 m thick fore-and-aft showing 0.06 m past the box's side, a reach 0.09 m across,
a hound 0.07 m, a kingbolt 0.038 m square with 0.05 m of its nut showing below the axle. Every
POSITION is derived from figures the record already carries. Both bolsters are the same depth
because a bolster's whole job is to bring two different axle heights up to one level floor, so the
**larger rear wheel sets that level** and the front bolster reaches down to the same line; what is
left underneath is exactly the space the hounds and the reach occupy. The reach sits on the top of
the front axle and passes under the rear one because that is where the two recorded wheel diameters
put it. Change `wagon_body_m` or either wheel and the whole gear follows.
**What is NOT invented here.** No recorded dimension moved to accommodate the gear. The wheel
diameters (1.37 m and 1.07 m), the body (3.05 x 1.07 x 0.55 m) and the bed height (0.95 m) are the
values L131 already claims and they are untouched — the gap was closed by drawing the members that
belong in it, not by dropping the box or shrinking the wheels.
**Consequence:** the wagon is 72 more triangles, and there are four of them in the town. It is also
now a wagon whose front gear visibly turns, which is a claim about the TYPE of vehicle — a farm
wagon, steering on a kingbolt — and not merely about its timber. Nothing in the record states the
type either; it follows from L131's invented dimensions, which are a farm wagon's.
**How to resolve:** any period drawing or description of a wagon in this town at this date detailed
enough to show what is under the box. The 2026-08-18 owner brief's images 7 and 11 (farm wagons in
the Green Tree's yard, and the ox-drawn covered train) both show gear under the box and are what
this entry was drawn from in spirit; they are tier-5 pictorial sources and settle the SHAPE, never
a dimension.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-18.

### L139 — The Sauganash's yard: a fence three plates draw and nobody measured, and three trees behind it
**Decision:** the ground behind the Sauganash Hotel is enclosed by a **vertical-board fence**
1.83 m tall, on posts 0.14 m square at 2.44 m centres, with three stringers behind boards
0.254 m wide butted at a 6 mm gap, and one 3.66 m gateway centred in its Market Street run; and
**three trees stand inside it** — two American elms at 17.0 and 16.5 m and an eastern cottonwood
at 18.5 m. The fence is `data/enclosures/sauganash_yard.json`, drawn by
`renderers/web/js/enclosures.js`'s new `board` branch; the trees are
`data/flora/plantings/sauganash_yard.json`, drawn by `renderers/web/js/trees.js` with the same
archetype the near-field wood uses. Neither carries a GLB and neither needs a bake.
**Why:** three of the owner's reference views of this hotel describe its yard, and
`data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md` records them verbatim — image 8, the
Petford watercolour: *"a vertical-board fence running off to the right; trees behind the fence"*;
image 9, the Braunhold engraving: *"board fence at the right"*; image 10, the Trowbridge drawing:
*"the tall board fence enclosing the rear yard"*. L136 took the FRONT of this building from the
same three plates and left the yard side of them unbuilt. All three are tier-5 pictorial and
retrospective, so they drive the setting and never a coordinate.
**What bounds the invention.** THE KIND of fence, that it was tall, that it enclosed the rear yard
and that trees stood behind it are the plates'. WHERE it stands is derived from three committed
things and nothing else: the hotel's own footprint and placement (12 x 8 m at 101.40 / -130.60),
Philo Carpenter's log shop on the same lot (6.096 x 4.877 m at 113.40 / -127.50), and the platted
lot under both of them (`data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json`, block `blk_lake_market`, lot 0).
The line leaves the hotel's south-west corner, runs south on its west wall line, turns east along
a rear line and returns north on the shop's east wall line to that shop's south-east corner — the
two buildings closing the fourth side themselves. **THE ONE INVENTED COORDINATE IS THE REAR LINE**,
and it is a rule so it can be audited: the segment joining the midpoints of the committed lot's two
side lines, which puts the yard on the front half of the lot and leaves the back half unclaimed.
Half is a convention. It is chosen rather than the rear lot line because Carpenter's shop stands on
this same lot, so the whole of it demonstrably was not the hotel's.
**Every dimension is invented**, and the gateway most of all: no view shows one, and a fence with no
opening encloses a yard nobody can enter. 6 ft, 8 ft centres, 10 in boards, a 6 mm shrinkage gap and
a 12 ft gate are period-plausible sawn work and none of them is a measurement. The board gap is the
number that makes this a fence you cannot see through, which is the whole difference between this
record and the picket gardens of L129.
**The trees are invented individually and not ecologically.** Their species, height bands, July
foliage colour and crown widths are `data/flora/zones/z10_settled_town.json`'s three relict
survivors — the record whose own note reads *"Survivor elm in a part-cleared block"* — and the
renderer refuses any stem whose stated height falls outside its species' recorded band rather than
drawing it. What is invented is that there are THREE, where each one stands, and that each sits at
the bottom of its band on the argument that a tree kept in a yard is a tree cut back from a building
for years. Image 8 shows crowns and resolves neither a count nor a species.
**What is NOT claimed.** The ground inside the fence is untreated — still the prairie sward the
flora layer plants over the whole town, where image 12 of the same brief shows fenced ground reading
as garden and dooryard green. That is the honest residual of this record and it is T-0067's, not
this entry's. And the fence is not a collision surface: a visitor walks through it, the same stated
shortcoming every enclosure in this layer has.
**How to resolve:** holding the Petford, Braunhold and Trowbridge plates as proper source records
(T-0075), which would turn the committed brief path both records cite into a `source_id`; or any
Chicago fence ordinance of the 1830s, which would settle height and construction at a stroke; or a
tax or insurance description of the Lake and Market corner lot, which would settle the yard's depth
and end the one invented coordinate here. None of them would ever give the trees their positions.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-18.


### L140 — The fort road: a line the 1830 plan implies and nobody ever drew
**Decision:** a travelled way, `fort_road` in `data/streets/1835.json`, runs from the east end
of South Water Street across the United States Reservation to the **south gate of Fort
Dearborn** — eleven vertices, a 5.5 m worn-earth track inside a 12 m corridor, drawn by
`renderers/web/js/streets.js` with the town's own streets and needing no bake. Its
`geometry_confidence` is **reconstructed** and its `wear_confidence` is reconstructed, so the
whole road dithers out with everything else invented when a visitor turns `reconstructed` off.
**Why:** T-0044's image-accuracy pass on the two Fort Dearborn plates
(`docs/RESEARCH/fort_dearborn_image_accuracy.md`). Both views show a travelled way at the
fort and the render had trackless prairie between the town and the gate — a garrisoned post
that mustered, traded and drew its stores through the town for nineteen years, standing at
the end of nothing.
**What bounds the invention.** THAT there was a road on this reservation is not invented: the
1830 Harrison plan draws one, and this dataset has been reading it since the garrison garden's
position note was written — that record places the plot *"west of the road"*. WHERE it arrives
is not invented either: *"large gates opened to the north and south"* (Kinzie, inside the fort
in 1831), *"one on the north and the other on the south side"* (Andreas), and a break in each
of those two walls and in neither of the others on the same 1830 plan. So a road that is east
of that garden and arrives at that gate has to run about where this one runs. The line is
routed to clear the garden's east corner and the two Beaubien buildings by more than the
platted half-corridor, and it is clipped by the water mask like every other track, so it
breaks rather than fords where the ground is wet.
**THE WESTERN REACH IS THE INVENTION, and it is most of the length.** South Water Street stops
at the United States Reservation, matching the 1833 order, and nothing reached draws what
carried on to the fort. Its eleven vertices are a plausible line across dry committed ground
and not a trace of anything: no source measures this road, states its width, says whether it
was one road or several beaten tracks, or names it. **The 1835 name is descriptive.** "The
fort road" is what this record calls it so the readout can call it something; the 2026 name is
the street that runs over this ground today, not a descent of name.
**What is NOT claimed.** The road stops at the gate. The track `p4_0` draws descending the
bank from the NORTH gate to the water is not drawn, because the bank it descends is the flat
plateau T-0004 exists to grade and a ramp down an ungraded bank would be two inventions
stacked. Nothing here touches the fort's own records.
**How to resolve:** the 1830 Harrison sheet re-read for its road line specifically — this
project has taken the fort, the garden, the barn and the ferry off that plate and never the
roads; or any survey of the reservation before its 1839 subdivision, which would fix the line
and probably its name at the same time.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-19.

### L141 — The Lake Street row at Dearborn: four roofs moved onto one line, and the party walls between them
**Decision:** four anonymous reconstructed roofs of the phase-one South Division parcel —
`recon_1835_south_d3_013`, `_d4_014`, `_c3_015` and `_d5_016` — no longer stand at the recipe's
northing seventeen to twenty-four metres inside the Clark–Dearborn block. They stand **on the
Lake Street frontage of that block, shoulder to shoulder on shared party lines**: a
nineteen-metre run packing west from the block's own Dearborn corner with the two-storey store
at the corner, and the fourth butted onto the west wall of `inf_butcher_market`, with a 3.6 m
gangway between the two runs. Their bearing is the block face's own and they carry none of the
jitter the parcel's interior rows carry.
**Why:** T-0077, and it is an owner ask made in as many words on 2026-08-18 — *"there should be
more and denser buildings. this is important."* — with a plate of this exact corner (the
Tremont House street scene, `data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md` image 5)
beside a screenshot of this exact corner in the render. The plate is a continuous two-storey
storefront row on shared party lines; the render was the Tremont standing alone on grass with
cottages scattered behind the frontage. The gap was not a missing building, it was a missing
TREATMENT: the parcel had only ever been able to say "a roof of this family somewhere in this
block", which is the right shape for a block's interior and the wrong shape for a street.
**What is NOT invented here, and it is worth being exact.** No roof is added, none leaves its
block, none is renamed, re-dimensioned or re-familied; the parcel still deals 40 principal and 8
ancillary roofs, the 665-roof programme's totals are unchanged, and every baked mesh is the one
it was. The frontage line, its bearing and the corner the run packs back from are **read from
the committed block boundary** in `data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json`, and the recipe
authors no coordinate for any of the four. The 0.80 m setback is not a measurement either: it is
the line the two frontage buildings already standing on this face use.
**WHAT IS INVENTED.** That these four particular units stood shoulder to shoulder, and that a
party-line row stood on this face at all. The plate supports the treatment for this street at
this date; it cannot say which buildings, and these buildings are inventions to begin with. The
corner unit stands 1.0 m clear of the platted Dearborn corridor, which is a choice and not a
kerb line. The gangway is 3.6 m because that is what the two runs leave between them once the
corner and the butcher's market are fixed — nobody picked the number, and nothing states that a
gap was there.
**And it crosses the conjectural side lot lines.** The row runs over the boundary between lots 4
and 6 of the generated grid, and three of its roofs now stand on one 24.6 m lot. That is a real
consequence and it is defensible only because those side lines are themselves conjectural — the
plat module states in its own prose that no lot here is numbered and that the side lines and the
alley are invented — and because a business frontage of 80 ft lots is exactly the ground that got
subdivided into narrow store fronts. One dooryard garden was lost to the move, derived away by
its own rule when its lot stopped holding a single dwelling; that is the rule working, not a
deletion.
**Consequence:** the three-metre separation rule that has applied to every generated roof in this
dataset now has one narrow exemption — a record that NAMES its neighbour in
`reconstruction.frontage.abuts`. It is one-directional, written into the record, and gated at
both ends: `check_frontage` in `tools/generate_inferred_infill.py` refuses a "party line" that is
actually a gap, and the household generator exempts only the named pair. A building that merely
happens to be close still fails.
**How to resolve:** any period document that puts a named business on a numbered lot on this
block face — a Chicago American or Democrat advertisement giving an address, or the 1839 fire
losses Andreas quotes, which itemised the Lake Street buildings that burned. That would replace
an invented unit with a named one on the same frontage, which is what the 665-roof programme's
substitution clause exists for.

### L142 — The South Water river row: fourteen roofs moved onto the frontage line, and turned to face the water
**Decision:** the fourteen anonymous reconstructed roofs the schedule dealt to the South Water
frontages of the five platted blocks between Franklin and State no longer stand centred on their
own lots, seven metres back from the street and facing the block's interior. They stand **on the
South Water frontage itself, shoulder to shoulder on shared party lines**, at a uniform 1.5 m
setback from the platted lot line, with their fronts on the block face's own bearing — which
means facing the river street, as every documented store on this reach does. Six runs in all:
one of three at Franklin, two at Wells (the second broken around a documented store), one of
three at LaSalle, one of two at Clark and one of three at Dearborn. 85.6 m of the row is now
continuous built frontage on one line; before, the same fourteen buildings were 6 m islands with
14-20 m of grass between them, each nudged off any line by its own lateral offset.
**Why:** T-0078, under the owner's standing ruling of 2026-08-18 — *"there should be more and
denser buildings. this is important."* — and its reference for this exact reach: *"South Water
Street in 1834 — now Wacker Drive"* (`data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md`,
image 11), which shows the south bank as a CONTINUOUS WORKING ROW of one-storey log and frame
buildings shoulder to shoulder facing the river, the street between them and the grassy bank.
The render had the town's business front as detached cottages on grass, with their backs to the
water. As at Lake and Dearborn (L141), the gap was a missing TREATMENT rather than a missing
building: the platted-block generator could only ever say "a roof of this family, centred on
this lot, at a period setback", which is the right shape for a residential back street.
**What is NOT invented here.** No roof is added, none leaves its block, none is renamed,
re-familied or re-dimensioned; every id, family band and baked placeholder mesh is the one it
was, and the 665-roof programme's totals do not move. The frontage line, its bearing and the end
each run packs back from are **read from the committed block boundary** in
`data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json`; the recipe authors no coordinate for any of the
fourteen. The 1.5 m setback is not a measurement of this frontage either — it is the closest
line the plat module's own lot margin allows, adopted so that the street wall is one wall.
**WHAT IS INVENTED.** That these fourteen particular units stood shoulder to shoulder, and that
a party-line row stood on these faces at all. The view supports the treatment for this street at
about this date; it cannot say which buildings, and these buildings are inventions to begin
with. Which end of each face the run packs back from is a choice — the town-centre end, on the
same gradient the blocks' original arrangement notes already argued from the Dearborn bridge —
and not a finding. The 2.4 m break in the Wells run is the smallest the three-metre separation
rule allows against Carpenter's store; nobody chose the figure, and nothing states that a gap
was there.
**And it crosses the conjectural side lot lines, and frees platted lots by doing it.** A run of
three roofs packed against one another occupies about 19 m where three lots span 75, so lots
that carried a roof now carry none: the 665-roof programme's re-derivation reports three roofs
schedulable on committed ground where it reported one. That is an honest consequence of density,
not new headroom anybody voted for — the lots are free because the row is tighter than the grid,
and a later parcel that builds on them is making its own claim.
**The row also turned round, and that is a correction rather than a liberty.** The platted-block
placement takes its bearing from the way INTO the lot, so every roof it has ever placed faces
away from the street it fronts; `docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md` pins `rotation_deg` as the facade bearing,
0 = facing north, and every documented South Water store carries 0. The row now carries the
face's own bearing. The same 180° flip still stands on this generator's other placements —
Lake-facing and alley-facing roofs across twelve blocks — and is filed as its own ticket rather
than swept into this one.
**How to resolve:** any period document that puts a named business on a numbered lot on this
frontage — a South Water Street advertisement in the Chicago American or Democrat giving an
address, or an itemised loss list — would replace an invented unit with a named one on the same
line, which is what the 665-roof programme's substitution clause exists for.
**Two of the fourteen were re-dealt on 2026-08-19 (T-0102) and are no longer named above.** `..._dearborn_d5_01` and `..._dearborn_d4_02` were the deep-plan and two-room cottages at the west end of the Dearborn run. The schedule re-deal that put two two-storey stores on the row's east end took those two slots (L143), so the ids no longer name a building and this entry's Covers field can no longer claim them. Nothing above is withdrawn: the twelve that remain still stand exactly as described, and the two that went are described where they went.
**The Lake-face roof of `blk_south_water_dearborn` was re-dealt on 2026-09-04 (T-0593) and is
named above under a new id.** `..._dearborn_d3_03` is now `..._dearborn_h1_03`: the same slot, on
the same lot, at the same 5.5 m setback and −2.0 m lateral offset, re-dealt out of the D3
one-room cottage band into H1 because a documented notice calls the house on that lot LARGE
(**L222**). The position this entry admits is unchanged and invented on the same reasoning, so
the Covers token follows the id rather than being dropped — unlike the two T-0102 retired in the
paragraph above, which stopped naming a building at all.

### L143 — Two two-storey stores anchor the South Water row, and two cottages were re-dealt to buy them
**Decision:** the east end of the South Water row — the corner of the last block of it, between
Dearborn and State, where State Street is the platted town's eastern limit — now carries **two
narrow two-storey frame stores** instead of two one-storey cottages. `blk_south_water_dearborn`
was dealt an all-D-family mix; two of those slots, the D5 deep-plan cottage and the D4 two-room
cottage, are now **C3 narrow two-storey stores**, and the run is re-chained so the two stores take
the block's east corner and the surviving D3 one-room cottage stands west of them. Both stores are
about 6 m wide, 13 m deep and 5.9 m to the eaves, against the 2.5 m eaves of the cottages beside
them; they stand on the same line, at the same 1.5 m setback, on the same shared party walls.
**Why:** T-0102, and the owner's reference for this reach — *"South Water Street in 1834"*
(`data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md`, image 11) — which shows the row's east end
anchored by two-storey frame stores over a terrace of one-storey log and frame buildings. T-0101
(L142) put the row on its line and could not build that: `check_block` holds a parcel to the family
mix it claims, and the five South Water blocks were dealt dwellings throughout, so the town's
business front read as a terrace of cottages.
**The choice, and why it went this way.** The ticket named two routes — re-deal the schedule, or
grow the 665-roof total under a liberty. **The total does not move and did not need to.** The
programme carries seventeen C3 roofs and eight of them stand, so nine narrow two-storey stores were
already unbuilt and apportioned to the districts rather than to any block; the programme file says
in its own words that a per-unit family mix is *"an apportionment of that district's remainder, not
a claim about any block"*. Two of those nine stand here. The D4 and D5 they displace go back into
the south district's remainder, which held thirty-four of each before this run and holds
thirty-five after it. Growing 665 to buy roofs the programme already owned would have been
inventing headroom the town does not need, so it was refused. The block still builds six roofs,
five principal and one ancillary, against the same headroom of six.
**WHAT IS INVENTED.** That a store stood on this corner at all, that there were two of them, and
that they were two storeys. The reference supports the TREATMENT — a business front whose east end
is anchored by taller frame stores — for this street at about this date; it cannot say which
buildings, and these buildings were inventions before they were stores. Both dimensions are
sampled inside the C3 band the reconstruction spec authors, exactly as every other anonymous roof's
are, and every value on both records grades `reconstructed` with its own note saying so. No
coordinate is authored: the line, its bearing and the corner the run packs back from are read from
the committed block boundary in `data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json`.
**What is NOT invented here.** No roof is added and none is removed; no roof leaves its block; the
surviving D3 keeps its id, its band and the household the inferred-household layer housed in it.
**How to resolve:** any period document placing a named South Water business on a numbered lot at
the State Street end — an advertisement in the Chicago American or Democrat giving an address, or
an itemised loss list — would replace an invented store with a named one on the same line, which
is what the 665-roof programme's substitution clause exists for.

### L145 — Five South Water landings, stated by no source and asked for by name

**Decision:** five merchant records on the South Water river frontage now STATE a dock —
`value: true, confidence: reconstructed` — where no source states one: J. H. Kinzie's
forwarding store, Jones's grocery and provision store, Harmon & Loomis's store, P. F. W.
Peck's store and Philo Carpenter's South Water store. Where the traced 1834 bank reaches the
frontage the wharf layer draws the landing in its standard form (Kinzie's and Jones's today);
where the trace runs out — it ends at local E 390, and Carpenter's, Peck's and Harmon &
Loomis's frontages lie east of it — `tools/generate_river_wharves.py` refuses the landing
with the reason on the record (clause 4b) until the trace is extended (T-0106). The Temple
Building on the same frontage gets no landing from the same rule: worship and a school take
nothing off a schooner.
**Why:** the owner, 2026-08-18, verbatim — *"you can add more docks!"* — with the standing
ruling not to ration reconstructed items to the attested instances (AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED
IS A TIER; T-0062). T-0041 drew the only two docks any source states and its own record named
the South Water stores as frontages the evidence refused; the ruling overrides that rationing,
and this entry is the honest cost of the override: THE EXISTENCE of each of these five
landings is invented, one tier below the two warehouses whose dock is stated.
**What bounds the invention:** the TRADE, per record in its own dock note — a forwarding and
commission house takes goods off schooners by definition; Jones's did forwarding work by 1834;
the others stocked heavy waterborne freight. The REACH — all five stand on the working bank
between the forks and the Dearborn drawbridge that the 2026-08-18 brief (image 3) shows
crowded with masts. The PRACTICE — wharfing-out along the south bank, the habit T-0041's
research note records. Every DIMENSION of each drawn landing is the wharf layer's standard
form, already claimed at L132; this entry claims only the statements themselves. What would
replace them: the Chicago Democrat's advertising columns or the 1833-1836 harbour reports
naming any of these merchants' wharves — the same instruments L132 waits on.

### L146 — Thirteen boats on the river, every hull of them invented

**Decision:** the river carries watercraft now — `data/boats/era_boats.json`, drawn by
`renderers/web/js/boats.js`: three two-masted lake schooners moored in the reach of the main
stem below the Dearborn Street drawbridge, TWO MORE AT THE WOLF POINT LANDINGS (T-0140 — one
in the branch reach above the forks, one in the South Branch reach below them abreast Robert
Kinzie's store), two rowboats on the water off the South Water bank and two drawn up at its
edge, one skiff afloat off the west bank at Wolf Point and one hauled out below its cabins,
and two bark canoes hauled out on the bank below Fort Dearborn.
Every boat is unmanned, unnamed, and graded `reconstructed` at every vertex; every position,
heading and dimension is authored in the record with its own note. The layer refuses rather
than adjusts — a boat without its own draft of water under the whole keel, a beached hull
authored onto open water or up on the prairie, or any hull within 30 m of the drawbridge's
crossing line is not drawn, with the reason on the record.
**Why:** the owner, 2026-08-18, verbatim — *"you can add boats correct for the era! they
would exist"* — and, of the drawbridge engravings, *"also note the boats there"* (T-0063),
under the standing ruling to be liberal with reconstructed items and label them as such
(AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER). No source names, places or measures any particular
vessel in this river on 1835-07-01, so every hull is an invention; the schooner Illinois,
cheered at Newberry & Dole's wharf in July 1834, is deliberately NOT drawn or named, because
a named vessel at a berth on a date is a claim no source makes.
**What bounds the invention:** the TYPES — the 2026-08-18 brief's two drawbridge engravings
(images 2 and 3) show schooner-rigged vessels moored close by the bridge and masts crowding
the reach below it; image 11, the South Water 1834 view, draws rowboats on the water and at
the bank; the committed 2026-08-11 fort plates put bark canoes at the fort reach; and 1830s
lake commerce ran on schooners, with steamers rare calls. The SIZES — a restrained 16.5 m
schooner because the modelled channel gives under 3 m of water; skiff and canoe dimensions at
the ordinary proportion of their kinds. The PLACES — the same reaches the engravings crowd,
against the committed heightfield, which is what the refusal rules hold each hull to; the
WOLF POINT berths are DERIVED rather than picked, each one an offset off the committed west
bank abreast a frontage this project already stands, at close to the westernmost line where
the heightfield floats that hull at all — so the reach's own shoaling, not taste, decides how
near the bank a schooner may lie. WHAT THOSE TWO DO NOT REPRODUCE, and it is recorded rather
than glossed: plate "11" hangs its masts over the GREEN TREE's roofline, and from that inn's
own visitor stand these read beside and beyond it instead — the committed placement puts the
tavern a full block back from the bank, and no mast at 157 m can subtend a ridge that
subtends 10 degrees at 24 m. T-0141 carries the arithmetic and the placement question to the
owner. The
CANOES are trade watercraft drawn unmanned from the plates: the standing constraint on
depicting Native presence stands in full — no figures, no encampment, no staging — and any
depiction of the Potawatomi themselves remains out of scope pending consultation. What would
replace the invention: harbour-master or newspaper records of vessels lying in the river in
the summer of 1835 — the Chicago Democrat's marine columns are the instrument.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-19; extended 2026-08-22 (T-0140).

### L147 — Terrain: the bridge approaches are invented earthworks
**Decision:** eight graded road corridors (`approaches` in `terrain_spec.json`, all
`reconstructed`) meet each bridge deck at grade: earth fills rising at 1 in 12 onto the two
branch bridges and the Dearborn Street drawbridge, and shallow cuts grading the banks down to
the slough crossing's low deck. Each fill's crest is carried 3 m past the deck end into the
shallows — the fill the attested log abutment cribs retain, and the only places the generator
deliberately raises traced water above the plane.
**Why:** the 1883 old-settlers statement makes the branch bridges WAGON bridges — "these were
both wagon bridges", "about six feet above the water, so that teams passed under them on the ice
freely" — and the drawbridge carried Dearborn Street over the main stem, so approaches existed
as surely as the bridges did; no source reached describes their form, length or grade (L30's
long search stands). What bounds the invention: the crest heights are the records' own deck
heights, restated — if a deck moves, the ground-contact gate reopens the gap and fails; 1 in 12
is a comfortable team haulage grade, inside period wagon-road practice; the 1-in-2 side slopes
are inside the angle of repose of loose fill; and the 4.0 m crest half-width is a modelling
allowance on the 2.5 m ground grid — the crest must hold every cell the bilinear sampler mixes
into a deck-corner reading, or the sampled ground misses the deck it exists to meet. The crest
is packed 0.06 ft under the plank line (`APPROACH_SEAT_FT` in the generator), so the last stride
onto the boards is a small step — which is what an earth approach against a plank deck is.
**Consequence:** the ground's Z = 0 contour no longer coincides with the traced 1834 waterline
in exactly eight declared places. Every modified cell is conjectural in the confidence channel:
turn off `reconstructed` in the confidence menu's colouring and the earthworks dither like every
other invention. The streets that reach the crossings ride up over the fills, which is the
point.
**How to resolve:** a period depiction of any crossing, or a levelled section — the same
instruments L30 named; a sourced approach length or grade would replace the invented figures one
for one.
**Covers:** `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.approaches.north_branch_west`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.approaches.north_branch_east`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.approaches.south_branch_west`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.approaches.south_branch_east`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.approaches.dearborn_south`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.approaches.dearborn_north`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.approaches.slough_west`, `terrain.e1834_harbor_cut.approaches.slough_east`.

### L148 — Every named frame building's siding stock is dealt, not found

**Decision:** the exposed face of the clapboard on the 24 named frame buildings is a per-record
value, `siding_exposure_m`, one of four period mill sidings — 4.5, 5, 5.5 or 6 in to the weather
— dealt by `tools/deal_siding_stock.py`: keyed to the phase's construction season, then advanced
so no frame building standing within 60 m shares its neighbour's stock. Derived records — the
anonymous parcels and the five frame buildings the inferred-household programme regenerates
byte-exact — stay on the archetypes' 0.14 m default, counted by the deal as fixed neighbours.
**Why:** no source states the exposed face of any Chicago building's siding, and until T-0049
every frame building wore one rhythm — the archetypes' shared 0.14 m constant, which is L22's
finding wearing a number. A town sided from separate seasons' shipments of St Joseph sawn lumber
(docs/research/02-flora.md) did not hang every wall from one pile, so a uniform course is as much
an invention as a varied one; this one is declared. The season key is a tendency the supply
argument can carry, and the 60 m separation is not a claim about 1835 at all — it is the surface
variety the owner asked for (K4: "no two share a face"), reconstructed as such.
**Consequence:** a visitor reading two neighbouring facades sees genuinely different board
courses — h_jones_store hangs ~25 courses where carpenter_south_water_store hangs ~19 on the
same wall height — and cannot tell from the mesh that the difference is dealt rather than
documented. The Evidence panel's `reconstructed` grade and the note on every value say so.
**How to resolve:** any survivor's account, bill of lading, mill advertisement or measured
photograph stating a board width for a named building replaces that building's dealt value one
for one; a document on the town's lumber stock would replace the whole set's bounds.
**Covers:** `bates_auction_room.form.siding_exposure_m`, `carpenter_south_water_store.form.siding_exposure_m`, `chicago_american_office.form.siding_exposure_m`, `chicago_democrat_office.form.siding_exposure_m`, `dole_warehouse_south.form.siding_exposure_m`, `exchange_coffee_house.form.siding_exposure_m`, `first_presbyterian_church.form.siding_exposure_m`, `frederick_thomas_shop.form.siding_exposure_m`, `goss_cobb_saddlery.form.siding_exposure_m`, `green_tree_tavern.form.siding_exposure_m`, `h_jones_store.form.siding_exposure_m`, `harmon_loomis_store.form.siding_exposure_m`, `jh_kinzie_forwarding_store.form.siding_exposure_m`, `old_bank_building.form.siding_exposure_m`, `peck_store.form.siding_exposure_m`, `pruyne_kimball_drugstore.form.siding_exposure_m`, `sauganash_hotel.form.siding_exposure_m`, `st_marys_church.form.siding_exposure_m`, `steamboat_hotel.form.siding_exposure_m`, `temple_building.form.siding_exposure_m`, `thomas_church_store.form.siding_exposure_m`, `tremont_house_1.form.siding_exposure_m`, `lasalle_lake_house.documented_1834.form.siding_exposure_m`, `watkins_school_house.form.siding_exposure_m`, `western_hotel.form.siding_exposure_m`.

### L152 — The Green Tree's fabric from the plates: bays, end stacks, and the rear ell

**Decision:** the Green Tree Tavern is dressed to the retrospective views (T-0083): even
6-over-6 sash bays along both eaves elevations with the attested mid-side door on the Lake
Street elevation, doors and small attic lights on the gable faces, one chimney stack on the
ridge at each gable end, and a low gabled rear ell — 5.5 × 4.5 m, 2.6 m walls, its own gable
carrying a 2.4 m carriage door to the yard — off the rear gable end. The wagons of L133 draw
up square to the ell's far wall now, the same derivation measured from the built rear face.
**Why:** plate "11" of the owner's 2026-08-11 reference set
(`data/sources/assets/prefire_views_kevin_2026_08/p6_0.png`) and the Braunhold/Trowbridge
views written up in the 2026-08-18 owner brief draw all of it — even bays, end chimneys, the
lower gabled wing with its wide carriage door — and John Gray attests low one-storey
additions at both ends by 1838-41. Tier-5 pictorial sources may drive massing and
fenestration rhythm as `inferred` and never a coordinate, so the SCHEME is inferred and every
SIZE here is invented: the bay count is arithmetic on the footprint (the plate draws a longer
building than the attested room module carries), the stack inset, the attic light, the door
leaves and every ell dimension are the archetype's numbers, and whether the ell stood on
1835-07-01 at all is a reconstruction under the owner's 2026-08-18 standing ruling. Only the
REAR ell is built although Gray names both ends: the committed placement puts the west face
on Canal Street's frontage with no ground for a wing — an asymmetry that itself leans on the
record's open "Lake and West Water" placement question, and is recorded on the attribute.
**Consequence:** a visitor at Lake and Canal sees a clapboarded, regularly fenestrated long
elevation with a door in it, end stacks, and a low tail with a carriage door — none of which
any 1835 witness describes — and cannot tell from the mesh which parts are the plate's and
which are this entry's. The Evidence panel's grades and the notes on `elevation_scheme`,
`chimney_placement`, `side_entrance` and `rear_ell` say so value by value.
**How to resolve:** the c. 1859 photograph (`chm_green_tree_1859`) settles the bay count, the
end stacks and the ell in one look; T-0075's plate identifications would raise the citations
from committed paths to source records; dating Gray's additions replaces the ell's
reconstruction with a phase. The scheme, the side door and the stack placement are graded
`inferred` on the record — their reasoning lives in their own notes, which is where the gate
requires it; this entry's Covers admits the parts that are invented outright.

### L154 — The Sauganash's fabric from the three views: wing door and hood, frontispiece, brick and moss, and the louvre pitch

**Decision:** the Sauganash Hotel (`sauganash_hotel`, frame_1831) is dressed to the three
retrospective views of the 2026-08-18 owner brief (T-0092): the log wing gets its own door
direct to grade — a 1.0 × 1.85 m leaf centred on the wing's street face — under a shed-roofed
porch hood 1.7 m across, projecting 0.8 m and falling 2.12 → 1.90 m onto two slim hewn posts;
the main block's front door gets a small flat-hooded entrance frontispiece — 0.23 m pilasters
to 2.18 m and a flat hood slab-and-crown to 2.31 m spanning 1.9 m; the stacks turn unpainted
brick and the shingle roof takes the Petford view's dark green/moss tone (0.20/0.26/0.17
linear RGB); and the attested bright-blue shutters gain louvred slats, eight to the leaf.
**Why:** images 8, 9 and 10 of `data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md` — the
Petford 1831 watercolour, the Braunhold/Andreas engraving and the Trowbridge drawing — draw
all of it, and tier-5 pictorial sources may drive form, fenestration and materials as
`inferred` and never a coordinate or a measurement. So every SCHEME here is the views' and
every NUMBER is the archetype's: no source states a dimension of the leaf, the hood, the
frontispiece or a slat, and both colour claims rest on the one coloured witness (the
watercolour), the engravings being monochrome. The claims are graded value by value on the
record at their own honest strength — the door on two views, the hood on the engraving alone,
the louvres on the Trowbridge drawing alone, which the record's own note calls the weakest of
the three claims.
**Consequence:** a visitor at Lake and Market sees the wing keep its own working entrance
under a hood, a dressed front door, brick stacks and a moss-dark roof — none of it described
by any 1835 witness, whose one vivid sentence gives the white paint and the bright-blue
shutters — and cannot read a single size off the mesh as evidence. The Evidence panel's
grades say what each claim rests on; the geometry carries each claim's own confidence (the
louvre slats are graded weaker than the leaves they sit in); this entry admits the numbers.
**Superseded in part, 2026-09-04 (T-0626):** the log wing this entry dressed is not the
hotel's to draw. `drloih_beaubien` captions the very engraving cited here — "The log cabin on
the left was Chicago's first drugstore" — so the annex in all three views is
`philo_carpenter_log_shop`, a record this dataset already held and already stood at the same
corner; the hotel was drawing it a second time, in front of its own street face, which the
owner reported. `log_wing`, `log_wing_door` and `log_wing_porch_hood` are `false` on the
record from that date, so the leaf, the hood and their two posts are no longer built. Nothing
else in this entry moves: the frontispiece, the brick, the moss roof and the louvre pitch are
the main block's and are unchanged, and the door and hood are not withdrawn as READINGS —
they belong to the cabin's own record. **L217** carries what replaced the wing.
**How to resolve:** T-0075's identifications would raise the citations from committed README
paths to source records; a better scan of any of the three views could correct the sizes; a
photograph does not exist — the hotel burned in 1851 — so the dimensions stay this entry's
unless a measured description surfaces in Andreas p. 106 or an insurance record.

### L157 — The material sheet paints the town: the programme's dealt finish outranks a defaulted `paint`, and a roof's weathering is not its covering

**Decision:** `generators/common/materials.py` — `docs/RESEARCH/materials.md` written as code
— now decides the colour and the roughness of every wall, roof, log, chinking and heavy-timber
surface in the shipped GLBs (T-0007), and three choices inside it are this project's rather
than any source's. **First**, where a record carries both a `reconstruction.finish_key` and a
`form.paint`, the dealt finish decides the wall. **Second**, the roof colour of every archetype
building is taken from `reconstruction.roof_condition` — fresh, weathered, darkened, patched —
so a town whose 234 roof slots were one colour now carries four. **Third**, the roughness of
every wall in the town moves onto the sheet's per-substrate values (clapboard 0.86, hewn log
0.92, sawn board 0.94, brick 0.90, rubble stone 0.93, trodden earth 0.95) with the three
coatings overriding them (limewash 0.90, lead paint 0.60, iron oxide 0.85), replacing the flat
0.75 / 0.85 / 0.92 each archetype used to apply to everything it built.
**Why:** the first is not a tie-break between rival claims — all 44 records carrying both
attributes AGREE, stating `whitewash` against `whitewash` and `red` against `red_oxide`. It is
a choice between a value the 665-roof programme dealt against a committed, gated schedule and a
`paint: unpainted` that the archetypes' own defaults wrote into the record with a note saying
in terms that the family band does not speak to paint or finish and the value is the
generator's type default. The dealt finish is the better evidence of the two, and 156 records
were carrying it into nothing. The second and third are the sheet's own numbers, and the sheet
grades them honestly: the finish and condition vocabularies are `reconstructed`, bounded by
`owner_chicago_1835_reconstruction_spec_2026`, and every roughness in the sheet is reasoned
rather than sourced — no source this project holds measures the gloss of anything, and none
ever will.
**Consequence:** a visitor walking South Water Street sees a town of many finishes where
before every unpainted wall was one brown and every roof one grey, and **none of that variety
is evidence.** It is a schedule's deal, rendered. The one thing it does NOT do is claim a roof
covering: R-W2a finding 2 stands, no record in this dataset states what any Chicago roof of
1835 was made of, and the sheet carries no `shingle` and no `roof_board` row. A `darkened` roof
is a statement about weather. Each archetype's roof ROUGHNESS is left as its own committed
literal for the same reason — the sheet separates a board roof from a shingle field by 0.03 of
roughness, and moving that number either way would be choosing between two coverings nobody
wrote down.
**How to resolve:** a source that states a covering for any Chicago building of 1835 turns the
roof half from a condition into a material and is worth a parcel of its own (materials.md §5
names the schema question it raises across 315 records). A source that states a finish for any
named building would raise that building's wall out of the programme's deal and into its own
attestation. Neither would change the mechanism, only the rows it reads.

### L158 — Fenced ground is not prairie: a working yard's dust, a pound's trodden earth and a dooryard's kept green, all of it invented

**Decision:** the ground inside every fence in this town is drawn, and it is drawn DIFFERENTLY
from the ground outside it (T-0067, `renderers/web/js/yards.js`). The prairie sward is
suppressed inside each enclosure's interior and one of three treatments is laid on the committed
heightfield in its place. **`worn_earth` — a working yard:** bare hoof- and wheel-worn dust with
the tracks a turning team leaves in it, and sparse trampled grass surviving in a 1.3 m fringe at
the fence line where the wheels do not reach (the Western Hotel's wagon yard). **`trodden_earth`
— an animal pen:** bare, fine, poached earth, darker than the yard's dust, with no wheel rut
anywhere in it and almost no grassy fringe (the estray pen). **`dooryard_garden` — a dooryard or
garden:** short kept green over the whole plot, a bank of up to four tilled beds in drills on the
side away from the gateway, and a trodden path in from the gateway itself (the town's fifteen
picketed plots and the Sauganash's rear yard).
**Why:** the owner asked for it in as many words on 2026-08-18 — *"everplace that is fenced in
would have a different ground, the wagon yard would probably be dirty dusty ground and fences
around properties inside the fence would not be wild prairie but curated lawn and garden or
animal pens"* — and the model agreed with him before he said it. **Three of the four enclosure
records already declared this exact omission in their own `ground` blocks**, with
`geometry: "absent"` and a note beginning *"NOT DRAWN, AND SAYING SO IS THE POINT"*; the estray
pen's research note listed its sward as the first of three residuals; and L129 says of the garden
pickets that the ground inside the fences is not drawn *"and it is prairie sward here, because
nothing states what was grown on any lot in this town."* A fence whose inside is identical to its
outside says nothing about why it is there. The reference for what fenced ground in this place
looked like is the same one the fences themselves rest on: the Kinzie-view plate's picket-fenced
garden plots, and image 12 of the 2026-08-18 owner brief, which shows fenced ground reading as
garden, orchard and dooryard green rather than as prairie.
**Nothing here is attested and the scheme IS the invention.** No source this project holds states
the surface of any yard, pen or garden in Chicago in 1835 — not what it was worn to, not what was
grown in it, not whether any of it was gravelled, planked or plain mud. What the three treatments
rest on is USE, read off each record's own attested function: a yard that wagon trains were driven
into daily was not grass; a pound that held a beast until its owner claimed it was trodden; a plot
fenced with pales at a hand's width to keep poultry out of the vegetables had vegetables in it.
Every vertex of every treatment carries `reconstructed`, so hiding that tier removes the whole
scheme and leaves the ground exactly as the sources leave it.
**What bounds it, and what is a rule rather than a claim.** WHICH ground gets WHICH treatment is
stated on the enclosure records (`ground.treatment`) rather than decided in the renderer, so it is
auditable where every other claim in this project is. WHERE the ground is comes from one of two
places and never from a guess: the pound's perimeter and each of the fifteen garden plots already
CLOSE A RING, and their interiors are that ring, with no new coordinate authored for any of them;
the Western Hotel's yard and the Sauganash's yard have a fourth side that is BUILDINGS rather than
fence, so each authors an `interior_local_enu_m` walked entirely from committed building corners
and coordinates already on its own runs. The BEDS and the PATH are derived inside the plot from its
own axes and its own recorded gateway — beds inset from the fence, laid away from the gate, capped
at four so that one rule fills a 28 x 20 ft kitchen plot and leaves a hotel's back yard mostly green
with a garden patch in one corner; the path runs in from the gateway on the inward normal of the
side it stands on. Both are clipped to the interior, so neither can escape its fence. The fringe
widths, the tones, the bed pitch and the drill spacing are the renderer's own numbers and are the
same kind of invention as the treatments themselves.
**Consequence:** a visitor standing in the Western Hotel's yard is standing on dust, and a visitor
at a picketed lot on Randolph is looking at green, beds and a path. None of it is evidence. The
counterweights are the confidence view — all of it disappears at `reconstructed` — and the records
themselves, each of which now states what its ground is and that nothing attests it. **The TREES
are deliberately not suppressed:** the dooryard plantings (L151) and the Sauganash's own three
stems stand inside these fences by record, and a suppression that reached the woody layer would
delete every one of them. This entry takes the sward and nothing else.
**How to resolve:** a Chicago or Cook County ordinance about yards, pounds or nuisance ground would
settle the two earths; any tax, insurance or sale description of a town lot naming a garden, an
orchard or a yard surface would turn one of these interiors from a rule's output into a finding;
and holding the Kinzie-view plate as a proper `chicagology_*` source record (T-0075) would give the
garden treatment a citation instead of a committed path. Related: **L127** and **L128** (the two
fences), **L129** (the garden pickets, whose "the ground inside the fences is not drawn" this
answers), **L139** (the Sauganash's yard fence), **L151** (the stems inside them).
**Recorded:** 2026-08-21.

### L159 — The town's signs say what they are: thirty-three invented names, in ten colourways, on five mountings
**Decision:** every sign on the business layer now carries the **name of the business behind it**,
painted on the board or straight onto the front of the building, in one of **ten colourways** and
**four letterforms**, on one of **five mountings** — `bracket_board` (the wolf sign's own arm and
straps), `awning_board` (the same plank hung under a hood that falls 0.34 m to its outer edge),
`wall_board` (a board fixed flat on the front under a cap), `post_board` (a pole at the street edge
1.90 m out from the wall, with a cross-arm and the board under it) and `facade_painted` (the name
on the boards of the building and no board at all). The count rises from 23 signs to **33**: the
trade list gains a WORKS AND WAREHOUSE class — smiths, warehouses, packing houses, a tannery, a
soap and candle manufactory, a brickyard — which paints its firm on its front and hangs nothing.
The wording, the colours, the letterform, the mounting and the panel are all `reconstructed`, on
every vertex. `tools/generate_business_signboards.py` chooses all of it, `tools/check.sh`
re-derives the record byte for byte, and `renderers/web/js/signage.js` draws what the record says.
**Why:** the owner asked for it, 2026-08-18, verbatim: *"you can and should put the name of the
location on the sign board. the sign boards should have variation in color and style and signage
font and color, some signs may hang from an awning and others may be on the building or painted on
the face of the building. you need to add more signage and be period correct and it is fine if
they are reconstructions."* The standing ruling on invention covers the tier: *"you are totally
fine to be liberal with adding reconstructed items when i ask for things, you can just label and
mark them as such."*
**WHAT THIS OVERRULES, AND IT IS THIS PROJECT'S OWN WRITING.** L130 ended *"**The blankness is the
second half of the honesty** … two dozen invented shop names painted across the scene would be the
most conspicuous fiction in it"*, and the generator's docstring said the same in stronger words.
That reasoning was sound and it has been overruled by the person it was written for. Read it now
as the argument that was available before the ask, not as a rule still standing. **L25 is NOT
overruled and is not touched.** Its subject is an IMAGE — the Wolf Point Tavern's painted wolf,
which no source describes — and no board in this town carries a picture or a trade device. A NAME
is a different object: the dataset already holds it, the card already shows it, and the only thing
invented in painting it on a plank is that a signwriter was paid to do so.
**What bounds the invention, in three parts.**
*The WORDING* is `sign_text`, which is the record's own `name` and nothing else, less a trailing
parenthetical where the dataset carries one ("Tremont House (the first)" is this project telling
itself which Tremont it means, not something a signwriter put on a board). So the sign and the
card agree by construction, and the smoke asserts the agreement at the Tremont's own board rather
than trusting it. What is invented is that the business announced itself under that name, and it
is graded `reconstructed` even where the name itself is attested.
*The STYLE* is a table of ten grounds and four faces in
`tools/generate_business_signboards.py`, and **not one entry is a Chicago record**. No wording,
device or colour of any sign in this town survives. What the table is not is arbitrary: black
grounds with gilt letters, white lead with black, ochre (the cheapest pigment on a colourman's
shelf), Venetian red, Prussian blue and Brunswick green are the trade's ordinary stock, and the
four faces are the period's working letters — the signwriter's roman, the fat face that IS the
1830s display letter, the Egyptian slab that arrives beside it, and the plain block. WHICH sign
gets which is a rule, not a list: a stable hash of the structure id sets a preference order, and
the first style is taken that no sign within 40 m already uses — neither its id nor its ground
colour. That is the owner's *"no two are alike"*, enforced on every commit and asserted in the
smoke over every pair of signs a walker can see at once.
*The MOUNTING* is chosen by the trade's class from a cycle, so the cycle advances down a class
rather than repeating: a public house draws from awning / bracket / post, a counter from bracket /
wall / awning / painted, an office from wall / bracket / painted, and a works is always painted. A
mounting a neighbour within 40 m already uses is passed over, and a POST — the one mounting that
stands in the street rather than on the building — is refused in writing wherever the fronting
street's travelled track comes within a metre of where it would stand, or where the frontage layer
already lays a plank walk outside that wall. Every refusal is in the record's own `mounting_note`.
A painted band stands with its foot 2.30 m up so it clears a door head, and drops back under the
eave only where the wall has not the height for that — which is where paint goes on a front, and
also invented. Not one dimension of any mounting is a record's.
**THE ONE MOUNTING THAT IS NOT INVENTED IN KIND.** The post-hung board is the arrangement images 6
and 7 of `data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md` actually show at the Green Tree,
and T-0082 drew it there from that evidence (L135). This entry copies its SHAPE to one other
frontage, the Mansion House, which has no such plate — so the shape is a plate's and the claim
that this inn used it is not.
**Consequence:** a visitor walking South Water Street now reads the town instead of guessing at
it, and **every word of what they read is ours**. The counterweight is the same one L130 built and
it is unchanged: every vertex of the layer is graded `reconstructed`, so hiding that level takes
all thirty-three signs down at once and leaves the town as the sources leave it — mute, with one
wolf sign at the forks. What a visitor cannot see from the street is that the names are the
dataset's and the paint is not; the card behind each sign says so, and this entry is why.
**And the tier got cheaper, not dearer.** The layer draws **1,106 triangles** where it drew 1,380,
because a painted band is two triangles and a board fixed flat on a wall is twenty-four where a
bracket is sixty. The lettering costs nothing at all: the whole town's paint is ONE canvas atlas
and every triangle carries a `uv` into it, so the layer is still one draw call with one material,
which is the invariant `tools/smoke_renderer.mjs` has held since T-0039.
**How to resolve:** unchanged from L130 and now with more to answer for — a Chicago or Cook County
sign ordinance of the 1830s; an insurance, tax or sale description naming a shop sign; a
traveller's account of walking South Water Street; or any pre-fire photograph of a surviving 1830s
frontage opened at its holding institution (the Green Tree plate, ICHi-040230, is the nearest and
is unseen). One that gave a WORDING, a COLOUR or a MOUNTING for a named house would be the first
thing this project has ever held that could take one of those three off the reconstructed tier.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-21.

### L160 — South Water, Lake and Randolph Streets get plank sidewalks, board crossings, street-lining fences and hitching posts, all of it invented and all of it derived from the plat
**Decision:** `data/frontage/town_street_edge.json` lays the STREET EDGE along the two
streets that run beside the river's south bank — **South Water Street, which is the bank
itself, and Lake Street one block behind it, both frontages, from Market Street to State
Street**: **1,147.7 m of plank sidewalk** in 21 runs at the platted lot line, **9 board
crossings** (212.5 m — at the corners over the cross streets, and over Lake Street itself
between facing walks), and **12 board fences** (504.9 m) standing on the frontage line with
the walk at their foot. Every run, every board and every post is `reconstructed` on every
vertex; the record is GENERATED by `tools/generate_frontage_works.py` and re-derived byte
for byte by `tools/check.sh`, and `renderers/web/js/frontage.js` draws only what it says.
**Why:** the owner, 2026-08-18, of the first Cook County jail engraving, verbatim: *"note
the fences lining the street and what appears to be plank sidewalks. all of the streets
should be updated like this... at least south of the river or near the river."* Four
plates in `data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md` agree — image 1 (the
jail: board fences at the frontage line with a plank walk beside them), image 6 (the
Green Tree: *plank sidewalks with board crossings*), image 8 (the Petford watercolour of
the Sauganash: *plank sidewalk with a board crossing over the road*) and image 9 (the
Braunhold engraving of the same hotel: *plank walks on both frontages*). All four are
tier-5 pictorial and retrospective: they may drive setting, materials and treatment and
may never drive a coordinate. The standing ruling on invention covers the tier: *"you are
totally fine to be liberal with adding reconstructed items when i ask for things, you can
just label and mark them as such."*
**NO SOURCE IN THIS REPOSITORY STATES THAT A WALK OR A FENCE STOOD ON ANY PARTICULAR
STRETCH OF EITHER STREET ON 1 JULY 1835.** What is invented is: that a walk stood there at
all; its 1.83 m width, 0.11 m rise, 55 mm boards at a 0.32 m pitch and its stringer bays;
the crossings' width, board count and that they existed at these corners; the fences'
4 ft 6 in height, their 0.305 m butted boards, their two courses and their 2.44 m bays;
and every clearance and threshold in the rule below.
**WHAT IS DERIVED, and it is the half that makes 1.1 km auditable rather than 1.1 km of
typing.** A walk's LINE is a committed street centreline offset by half the committed
80 ft corridor — that is exactly what a block face of
`data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json` is, and `tools/generate_plat_lots.py` re-derives
every one of them from `data/streets/1835.json` on every commit. Move a centreline and
every board here moves with it; nothing is hand-placed on one block. Each face is then
MARCHED in 5.2 m steps and a step carries boards only if the ground under it is dry
committed ground (≥ 0.15 m over datum), rolls no more than 0.07 m (so the whole step can
be ONE surface a visitor stands on), leaves ≥ 0.35 m of verge outside the street's own
travelled track, and carries no committed footprint. A crossing exists only where two
runs stop either side of one corridor. A lot gets a fence only where it is improved and
its nearest committed wall stands 3 m or more back from its own frontage line — where it
does not, the BUILDING is the street wall and no fence is drawn in front of it. Every
stretch refused says which clause refused it, in the record's own `refused`.
**IT IS A SURFACE, NOT A STRIPE.** Each run publishes `footway_decks` — flat rectangles
at the highest ground under them plus the walk's rise — into the same walker deck registry
the bridges use (T-0045) and the river footway uses (L153). The visitor steps UP onto the
boards and stays on them for 220 m of Lake Street's north frontage and over the board
crossing at Wells Street, which the gate walks end to end rather than assuming.
**WHERE THE WALK BREAKS, AND WHY EACH BREAK IS A FINDING RATHER THAN A FAULT.** The
La Salle and State Street sloughs cross these frontages, and no crossing is committed over
either, so the walk stops at the water exactly as the river walk stops at the La Salle
mouth (L153). And the SOUTH WATER frontages come out in pieces — 46 to 71 m of a 97 m face
— because several documented stores on that side (Carpenter's, Jones's, Peck's, Kinzie's
forwarding store, the two newspaper offices) were placed against the MODERN kerb rather
than against this project's own platted line and stand up to 6.9 m out past it. The march
refuses those steps in writing and names the building in each one. Reconciling those
placements with the committed plat is filed as its own work (T-0127); until it happens the
gaps are the honest drawing of a disagreement this project holds.
**What it cost, measured on the published mirror at the release gate's own stand
(`frame('sauganash_hotel', 26)`), desktop:** full 794,916 → **855,832** of 1,000,000;
balanced 718,994 → **752,164** of 800,000; light 557,311 → **576,335** of 600,000. Draw
calls 65 → **78**, against a ceiling the owner raised the same day from 80 to 120 (argued
at `renderers/web/js/main.js` BUDGET). Three drawn decisions paid for the triangles and
not one of them moves a board: the boards carry no underside (two triangles facing the
earth they lie on), the stringers are laid in 2.08 m bays rather than under every board
wherever the generator has audited the ground flat enough for a bay-length stringer to
reach it, and each run shares ONE mesh with the crossings and the fence on it. Together
they take the walk from 61.6 to 42.8 triangles a metre.
**Consequence:** walking either street now reads as the jail engraving reads — a boarded
walk at the fence line, fences where the lots are improved and set back, and the buildings
themselves lining the street where they are built to it. Every metre of it disappears when
a visitor hides `reconstructed`, which is the truthful behaviour: this is a treatment the
plates show, applied by a rule, and not a record of what stood there.
**How to resolve:** a Chicago town order on sidewalks — the corporation legislated wooden
walks within a few years of 1835, and an order of the right date would give a width and a
material at a stroke; a Cook County lawful-fence ordinance of the 1830s, which would
replace the fence's height and stock outright; a tax, insurance or sale description naming
a walk or a fence in front of a named lot; or holding the jail, Green Tree and Sauganash
plates as proper source records with their institutions and dates (T-0075), which would
turn the committed path in `existence.note` into a source_id.
**Amended 2026-08-27 — the trading frontages get hitching posts (T-0194):** twelve posts
now stand in the verge outside the walk, one at each frontage the rule accepts. THE POST
ITSELF IS NOT NEW AND NEITHER IS ITS PLACE: it is the Sauganash's own post — 1.30 m of
0.16 m timber under a 0.22 m capped head, standing 0.90 m beyond the walk's outer edge —
carried across unchanged from **L136**, where it is claimed from that hotel's three
reference views and the saddled horse tied to one of them. What is new here is only WHICH
OTHER FRONTAGES get one, and that is a rule with five clauses, every one of them already
argued somewhere in this repository: a committed building stands on the lot; its
`function` is one of the trades `tools/generate_business_signboards.py` already rules take
their custom from a stranger off the street (the table is IMPORTED, not restated, so the
two layers cannot drift — a works or a warehouse took carts and drays at a yard gate and
is refused in writing); that trade is held `attested`, `documented` or `inferred` rather
than dealt by the roof schedule, which is what keeps posts off the anonymous slots; the
walk was actually laid in front of it; and the post's own stand is dry committed ground
with ≥ 0.35 m still between its outer face and the travelled track. It stands at 0.28 of
the BUILDING's own projected frontage rather than the lot's, because two trades can share
one platted lot on these streets and a fraction of the lot would put both posts in the
same hole. Seven frontages are refused and each names its clause — including the Sauganash
itself, which already stands its own two under L136 and is refused rather than given a
third. **What it cost: nothing in draw calls.** A post is standing timber, so it lands in
its street's existing standing mesh beside the fences (`frontage.js` `standingChunk`,
renamed from `__fences` because it is no longer only fences) — twelve posts, twenty-four
boxes, no new mesh and no new bounding sphere. **What is invented remains what L136
invents:** that a post stood on this ground at noon on 1 July 1835, and its height, its
section and its capped head. No source in this repository states that one did.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-21.
**AMENDED 2026-08-27 — RANDOLPH STREET IS NOW INSIDE THIS LIBERTY (T-0240).** Everything
above holds unchanged: the same rule, the same invented widths, rises, pitches, board
counts, fence heights and clearances, the same march in 5.2 m steps over the same committed
plat, and the same `reconstructed` on every vertex. **What changed is the scope, and only
the scope** — `EDGE_STREETS` in `tools/generate_frontage_works.py` carries a third street,
so **13 of Randolph Street's 14 platted block faces** are now laid by it. The record's own
`rule` block, which is the auditable statement of the whole scope, reads:

|  | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| block faces laid | 16 | **29** |
| plank sidewalk | 1,297.3 m | **2,468.3 m** |
| board crossings | 11 | **25** |
| street-lining fence runs | 11 (494.4 m) | **26 (1,345.6 m)** |
| walking decks | 96 | **190** |

The fourteenth Randolph face is refused rather than laid, and the record's `refused` names
the clause that refused it, exactly as every other refusal here does.

**No new invention is claimed and none is needed.** Not one number in the paragraphs above
moves; a third street is the SAME reconstruction applied to more of the plat, which is what
made it a generated layer rather than 1.1 km of typing. The owner's ask — *"all of the
streets should be updated like this... at least south of the river or near the river"* —
is the same ask, and Randolph is one block further from the bank than Lake.

**WHY IT COULD NOT BE LAID UNTIL NOW, and it was never about Randolph.** This street was
built and measured for T-0188 and taken back out: it read 97,588 triangles over `full` and
145,638 over `balanced`. That ledger's own conclusion was that the binding fact was the
frame, not the street — `balanced` stood 0.35 % under its ceiling **before** the parcel.
T-0223 then found the sun drawing 180,100 triangles of timber outside the ±240 m shadow
box, casting nothing the shadow map can hold, and culled it. Re-measured on the published
mirror with `tools/measure_detail_ceilings.mjs`, worst of T-0135's five stands:

| tier | desktop 1280×800 | mobile 390×780 | ceiling | original ceiling |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `full` | 1,369,835 | 1,272,801 | 1,425,000 | 1,400,000 |
| `balanced` | 1,201,248 | 1,148,172 | 1,260,000 | 1,210,000 |
| `light` | 745,904 | 695,030 | 1,050,000 | 1,050,000 |

Draw calls at the worst stand: 155 desktop, 146 mobile, of 215. Every tier is inside its
ceiling at every stand at both viewports, **and inside the ORIGINAL ceilings T-0229 exists
to restore** — `balanced` clears the original by 8,752 — so this street does not stand on
the temporary raise and is not unwound with it.

**WASHINGTON STREET IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN THIS LIBERTY (T-0241).** Both streets were
generated together first: 36 faces, 3,129.1 m of walk, and desktop `balanced` read
**1,260,174 of 1,260,000 — over by 174 triangles.** Washington's seven faces cost 58,926
at `balanced` and about 15,400 at each tier either side, so what refuses it is that one
rung rather than the town. It is filed with its number attached rather than bought with a
sixth re-basing of a ceiling, which is what T-0223, T-0229 and T-0237 exist to make harder.

**AMENDED 2026-09-03 — THE WALKS GET STRING PIECES, AND ONE MORE INVENTED MEMBER (T-0460).**
The owner reported the plank walk meeting the dirt road in a **jagged sawtooth**, from a
close stand, and said it was among the first things a visitor sees. It was: a walk laid as
boards alone ends, at each side, in a row of board ENDS — at a 0.32 m pitch with a 0.02 m
gap between them over a deck standing 0.11 m proud of the road, the outer edge of 3.17 km
of sidewalk was about twenty thousand short end-grain faces with daylight between them, and
the one member that did reach the ground (the 2.08 m bay stringer) stood 0.09 m inboard,
in shadow under the overhanging ends. He named the only two treatments he would accept:
the walk sits **consistently over** the road, or the boards **meet the mud** as boards in
mud do. **The first was taken.**
**What is now drawn, and what of it is new invention.** Each walk is held between two
**string pieces** — 0.09 m stock running ALONG the walk down each side, taking the outermost
0.09 m of its own 1.83 m width so the walk does not widen, its top flush with the boards it
holds and its foot reaching the lowest ground under its own length. The boards stop at its
inner face. This costs no timber the layer did not already draw: the string piece IS the bay
stringer, moved out to the walk's own edge and brought up flush with the deck instead of
stopping under it, so the box count does not move. What is NEW invention is exactly one
thing — **that these walks were built with edge timbers at all**, and its 0.09 m section.
No source in this repository states it. It is the same class of invention as the width,
the rise and the plank pitch this entry already claims, and it is claimed on the same
grounds: a plank sidewalk of ordinary sawn stock is what the plates show, and boards held
between string pieces is how such a walk is built.
**And a second thing moved with it, which is a correction rather than an invention.** A
board used to sample the terrain under its own centre, which put a fresh height on the deck
every 0.32 m — a walk laid in stringer bays does not do that, because the bay is the timber
that carries the boards. Every board in a bay now takes THAT BAY's height, which is what
makes the top of the string piece and the tops of the boards it holds one line to the
millimetre. Measured over the whole town: the largest height step between two consecutive
string pieces is **0.026 m**, against the 0.04 m the generator already audits a bay's ground
flat to. The rises are NOT reduced — the walk standing 0.11 m over the road is the point of
the treatment the owner chose, and what changed is that the rise now presents as one made
face instead of a row of end-grain steps.
**What is NOT treated, stated rather than left to be found.** The **board crossings** keep
their 0.06 m rise and take no string piece. A crossing lies in the wheel track, its boards
are laid ALONG the way a foot travels, and its sides are therefore already one continuous
board face rather than a comb of ends — there is no sawtooth on a crossing to resolve, and
an edge timber raised across a road is a thing to catch a wheel on.
**Held by the gate:** `tools/smoke_renderer.mjs` marches one named 98.6 m run in 0.2 m
stations and asks each of the 487 for timber from the deck down to the ground at the walk's
own edge line. On the geometry this replaced, **487 of 487** stations read as an open edge;
on the string piece, **0 of 487**.


**AMENDED 2026-09-03 — THE FENCE FOLLOWS THE LOT AND THE POST FOLLOWS THE DOOR (T-0426).**
Two of this liberty's clauses read the same test — *does a committed building stand inside
this platted lot* — and on a DEEP lot that test answers a question neither of them asked.
`blk_south_water_clark` runs two lot tiers, north onto South Water and south onto Lake, and
**no lot in that block fronts Dearborn Street at all**; a shop addressed in Dearborn
therefore stands on a lot whose frontage is Lake, 49 m from its own door. Found while
placing the New York Clothing Store (T-0385), measured on that branch, and it forced the
question of which street the furniture belongs to. **The two clauses were ruled apart, and
this liberty now says so.**

**The street fence stays with the LOT.** The owner ruled, 2026-08-31, verbatim: *"a lot that
fronts a street takes its street-lining board fence at that frontage, whatever way the
building standing on it faces."* That is `L160` read literally — the first Cook County jail
engraving shows the fence standing on the lot line, and a house set at the back of a deep lot
does not make the lot unimproved. **Nothing in the fence rule changes**, and no metre of the
1,669.0 m already laid moves; what changes is that the clause is now correct BY RULING rather
than by default, and a later reader meeting the same collision has the answer instead of the
argument.

**The hitching post follows the DOOR, and that half is a new refusal.** A post is furniture
for a stranger off the street, so it belongs at the face the trade opens onto.
`EDGE_HITCH_FACE_TOL_DEG` — **45 deg**, the midpoint of a right-angled grid where a building
fronting its own lot's street reads within a few degrees of the face and one fronting the
cross street reads about 90 off, with no population in between to tune to — refuses a post
whose building faces further than that from the platted face it would stand on, **and the
refusal is written into the record with both bearings**, exactly as every other refusal here
is. **Measured across all five frontage records, before the clause and after it: 18 posts
against 83 stated refusals, unchanged.** Exactly one committed building trips it —
`bates_auction_room` on `blk_south_water_clark`'s north face, facing 90.0 deg against a face
that looks 0.9 deg, 89.1 deg apart — and it was already being refused further down the same
rule for want of a walk to stand outside of. So no post moves; what moves is that its refusal
now names the reason that is actually true, which is that the lot fronts South Water Street
and the auction room's door does not. The clause bites for the first time when a shop like
the New York Clothing Store stands on such a lot with a walk laid in front of it, and landing
it before that building rather than after it is the whole reason it is here.

**What the record now states.** The generated `rule.note` in
`data/frontage/town_street_edge.json` carried four hitching clauses and the generator applied
five; the fifth is now stated there, together with the sentence saying the fence deliberately
does NOT follow the door. **No source in this repository states that either rule is right** —
both are the same tier-5 pictorial invention the rest of this liberty rests on, and the ruling
is an owner's reading of the plate, not a document.

**What is left over is a different fault and is filed as T-0461**: the Tremont House's goods
are laid on ground inside lot 7 while `tremont_house_1`'s own placement point falls 1.5 m
outside that lot, so one building's goods sit on another lot's frontage. The fence ruling is
what exposed it; it is not what caused it.

### L161 — The town encloses its property: a yard fence on 109 platted lots, in three types, every metre of it invented

**Decision:** the YARD of every improved platted lot in this town is enclosed (T-0068,
`tools/generate_lot_line_fences.py`, three generated records under `data/enclosures/`). A fence
runs up one side lot line, along the rear lot line at the alley, and down the other side lot line;
the fourth side is the lot's own buildings and the dooryard in front of them, which is the same
argument `data/enclosures/sauganash_yard.json` already makes about its own missing side — *"the two
buildings that stand on this lot close the fourth side themselves"*. **109 of the town's 120
improved platted lots**, on every one of the plat's 18 built blocks, carry one: **24 in board**,
**28 in picket** and **57 in split rail**, over 4.55 km of committed lot line, with a 10 ft cart
gateway on the alley. The other eleven are refused for want of room behind their buildings and
each of them says on the record which measurement refused it.
**Why:** the owner, 2026-08-18, verbatim — *"i think there should be more fences."* Image 12 of
`data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md`, Chicago circa 1833 looking east, is what he
was reading: **split-rail and board fences line the roads and enclose every property in the view.**
An enclosure is the NORM of an 1830s town lot and this model had four of them — a wagon yard, a
pound, a hotel's rear yard and fifteen garden plots. A town whose lots are open prairie to the
alley is a claim about property nobody made.
**Nothing here is attested and the scheme IS the invention.** No source this project holds names a
fence on any of these lots — not that there was one, not what it was made of, not how high it
stood. What is attested is a NORM, and it arrives as two retrospective pictures: image 12 above,
and the Kinzie-view plate's picket-fenced garden plots that L129 already rests on. Both are tier-5
pictorial: they may drive treatment, materials and setting and they may never drive a coordinate,
which is exactly how they are used here. Every vertex of every run carries `reconstructed`, so
hiding that tier takes all 3.5 km down at once and leaves the lots exactly as the sources leave
them.
**What is a rule rather than a taste.** WHERE the timber stands is the committed plat's and nothing
else: every run is a piece of a lot line out of `data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json`, corner to
corner, and the only derived numbers on it are where along that line the fence starts (the head of
the yard, 10 ft or more clear of the committed building nearest the street and no more than 40 ft
from the rear line) and where it stops for a committed footprint standing on the line. A side line
claimed by two neighbours carries ONE fence — a party fence is one fence — and the heavier type
wins, because the man who wants his yard private is the one who pays for it. WHICH TYPE follows
the traffic class this project already grades its own streets with in `data/streets/1835.json`: a
block all four of whose bounding streets are `principal` or `ordinary` is in the built core, and on
it a lot carrying a trade takes **board** (the yard behind a store is private working ground —
which is what the town's one attested board fence encloses) and a lot carrying only dwellings takes
**picket** (the Kinzie plate's treatment, the same one the garden plots are drawn with); a block
that touches a street classed `light` — Washington, State, Clinton — is on the town's edge or up an
outlying lane and takes **split rail**, which is what image 12 shows running out of the town.
`tools/check.sh` re-derives all three records byte for byte, so the rule stays the answer to "why
this lot and why this fence" rather than several hundred numbers somebody typed.
**What is invented inside the rule** is every dimension: the heights (5 ft 6 in board, 4 ft picket,
4 ft 6 in rail — each read against a fence already in this dataset rather than chosen fresh), the
post rhythm, the post sizes, the stock widths and the gaps beside them, the 40 ft cap on the yard,
and the gateway. A Chicago or Cook County lawful-fence ordinance of the 1830s would replace most of
those numbers outright and this project holds none.
**What these records deliberately DO NOT say is what is inside them.** L158 draws the ground within
a fence from the record's own `ground.treatment`; these three state none, and carry
`geometry: "absent"` with it. A town lot's yard held a woodpile, a privy, a stable, a patch of
trodden mud and a patch of grass in an arrangement that changed with the season and the household,
and nothing states which was where on any lot in this town. A garden can say what it is because a
garden is one thing; a yard is not, so the prairie sward stays exactly as the flora layer plants it
and the fence claims only the line it stands on. That is a deliberate difference from L158 and not
an oversight.
**What is NOT here.** The continuous street-lining fences at the road edge — the other half of
what image 12 shows — are T-0069's, and a line fenced twice is worse than a line fenced once. Lots
outside the 19 platted blocks (the West Division beyond the plat, the reservation, the North
Division) have no committed lot geometry to derive a line from at all, which is the same S9 gap
L129 records. And the fence is still not a collision surface: a walker walks through it, as they
have since L127.
**One thing this entry deliberately does NOT record as a liberty, because it is not one.** The
first cut of this scheme held four blocks at the plat's western margin back — 26 improved lots
that pass the rule in every respect — for the renderer's 80-draw-call ceiling, and said so on the
records. A budget is not a claim about 1835, and a model that quietly leaves out what it can
afford to leave out is exactly the omission this document exists to prevent. The owner ruled on
2026-08-21, verbatim, *"ok to raise the draw call budget"*, so the ceiling moved to 96 with its
own reasoning at the definition site (`renderers/web/js/main.js`) and the blocks came back. The
town this record fences is now the town the rule chooses, and nothing else.
**How to resolve:** a Chicago or Cook County fence ordinance of the 1830s; any tax, insurance or
sale description of a town lot naming a fence, a yard or an enclosure; and holding the two plates
as proper `chicagology_*` source records (T-0075), which would give the treatment a citation
instead of a committed path. Related: **L127** and **L128** (the two hand-authored fences),
**L129** (the garden pickets, whose rule this one is built on), **L139** (the Sauganash's board
fence), **L156** (what `light` does to this layer's shadows), **L158** (the ground inside a fence,
which these records decline to state).
**Recorded:** 2026-08-21.

### L162 — Sixty-four more wagons all over a frontier town: three types, every one invented, every one unhitched
**Decision:** the town's streets and working yards now carry **64 more vehicles** than the two
addresses the evidence reaches. Chicago holds **68 wagons** where it held four — **29 farm box
wagons, 24 covered emigrant wagons and 15 two-wheeled carts** — standing at the verges of **17 of
the town's 18 committed streets** and in the one enclosure whose own record calls its ground a
working yard. Not one of the 64 is attested. Every one is `reconstructed` on every vertex, carries
its own note saying what put it there, and disappears with the rest of the layer when a visitor
hides the reconstructed tier.
**Why:** the owner asked for them, 2026-08-18, verbatim: *"there can be more wagons! of course
there would be more wagons all over the place in a frontier town."* And the standing ruling of the
same day grades them: *"you are totally fine to be liberal with adding reconstructed items when i
ask for things, you can just label and mark them as such."*

**WHAT THIS OVERRULES, AND IT IS THIS PROJECT'S OWN WRITING — twice over.** `data/yard/
town_trade_goods.json` carried a refusal that read *"EVERY OTHER PLACE IN THE TOWN, refused in
writing … a dray dropped into Lake Street on the strength of a roadmap parenthesis would be
traffic invented to look busy … the yard whose own name is the attestation gets the wagon, and the
rest wait for a source."* The generator's docstring said the same in a heading — *"THE ONE WAGON,
and why there is one rather than twenty."* No source arrived; the person those sentences were
written for did. Both are kept verbatim on the record with the overrule written beside them,
because a reversal that erases what it reversed is not auditable. **What is NOT overruled:**
nothing is drawn in a travelled track. A dray mired in Lake Street is still a scene this project
has no source for, and it would be a claim about the road as well as about the wagon.

**WHERE EACH ONE STANDS IS A RULE, and the rule is the only part of this that can be argued with.**
A stand is offered every **48 m** along a principal street's committed centreline, **90 m** along
an ordinary one and **140 m** down a lane — the street record's own `traffic` class, which is the
only thing in this dataset that ranks one street above another — at the verge, **1.00 m** clear of
the travelled track's own edge. The **river street** is offered a stand every **20 m** instead,
because image 11 of the owner's brief draws a covered wagon TRAIN on it rather than one wagon
standing by itself. Both verges are tried, in a stated order, and the wagon faces the way traffic
on ITS side goes — so one verge faces up the street and the other faces back down it, and the
river street's train lands on its landward verge without a coordinate being written for it. At
every third stand of a quieter street the wagon is backed square to the road instead. Change a
committed centreline and every wagon on it moves; `tools/check.sh` re-derives the record byte for
byte.

**AND THE GROUND REFUSES MORE THAN IT KEEPS — 34 refusals, in writing, each with its reason.** A
stand is refused if it would put a wagon within a metre of a committed footprint; on a plank walk
or board crossing (`data/frontage/`, the same rectangles `frontage.js` hands the planters as
`keepOut` — a footway is a floor); inside a fence whose own record calls the ground a dooryard
garden or an animal pen (`data/enclosures/` `ground.treatment`, L158 — a wagon belongs on a
working yard's worn earth and nowhere else behind a fence); within a metre of ANY street's
travelled track including its own, which is what refuses nearly every stand offered at a crossing;
on a wharf deck or a hull drawn up on the bank; on ground under 0.60 m over the water surface or
off the modelled field; or where its own ground — body and pole together — comes within 1.20 m of
a wagon already standing. A further **177 stands were never offered at all**, because they fell
more than 16 m from every committed footprint: past that the street is running out into the
prairie, and a wagon parked in the grass two blocks beyond the last house would be this record
inventing a reason for it.

**NO DRAFT ANIMAL, NO DRIVER, AND THE YOKE IS WHAT THAT LEAVES.** This project models no fauna in
the scene — `renderers/web/js/fauna.js` is a card, not a herd — and L1's constraint on human
figures is untouched, so a wagon here cannot be shown hitched or driven. Every one of them stands
**unhitched**: the tongue or the pair of shafts lies DOWN ON THE GROUND at its own inclination,
and the covered wagons and the yard wagons have an **ox-yoke laid on the grass beside them** — a
beam 4 ft 8 in between its bows, invented like everything else here. The yoke is the honest half
of a team, exactly as the Green Tree's empty bench (L133) is the honest half of the sitters in its
plate: it says the oxen are out without drawing one.

**What the pictures did and did not decide.** The owner's brief drives the TYPE and never the
place: image 11's covered train sets the river street's vehicle and its density, image 7's farm
wagons in the Green Tree's yard were already L133's, and image 12's covered wagon on the open road
is why a principal street alternates covered and box. A tier-5 retrospective view may drive
furniture and setting and may never drive a coordinate — the division every layer on this ground
keeps.

**What it cost, and it was mostly paid for before it was spent.** The layer's geometry goes from
**10,336 triangles to 59,064**, and at the release gate's own stand the `light` tier — the safe
floor, the tier for a machine that cannot afford the others — draws **3,432 more triangles than
before**, 560,743 of 600,000. Sixty-four wagons for three thousand triangles, because two things
paid for them. First, the layer stops being one town-wide mesh that no frustum can cull and
becomes **one mesh per 100 m chunk of the town, all on the same material** — T-0115 item 2, the
saving that ticket named, measured and left costed. Second, a wheel gave back **32 triangles**:
five spoke boxes instead of six, and a six-sided hub instead of a ten-sided cask — both the
barrels' own missing-hoops argument, since a 9 cm hub drawn finer than the plank beside it is
triangles the eye cannot resolve. That is 7,744 across the 68 wagons now standing.

**And the DRAW-CALL budget was raised from 80 to 110 to allow it, which is a decision and not a
side effect.** Chunking trades calls for triangles, and the 80 was set when the town was one
batched mesh plus a handful of whole-layer meshes — a number that measured whether the batch
strategy had broken, which is no longer what it measures. Coarse 400 m chunks fit inside 80 and
drew MORE of everything at every tier; the ceiling was buying nothing and costing fidelity. The
owner authorised the raise on 2026-08-21 — *"ok to raise the draw call budget"* … *"or just raise
the budget?"* — and it is argued at `main.js`'s own definition of the number. **The triangle
ceilings did not move and `light` still draws inside the old 80 calls** (62 desktop, measured), so
the safe floor is exactly as safe as it was; the new headroom is spent at `full` and `balanced`.
The full before-and-after for all three tiers is in T-0115's ledger, per that ticket's protocol.
**How to resolve:** a teamster's or forwarding house's day-book naming what stood in a Chicago
street; a corporation order about vehicles left standing, which would put a number on the thing
Ordinance 9 only implies; or any dated view of a Chicago street before 1840. Any of the three
would replace a rule with an address.

### L163 — The Dearborn drawbridge, built to its engravings: the frames' bracing, the hoist chains, a two-leaf draw and a railed deck

**Covers:** `dearborn_street_drawbridge.draw_1834.form.draw_leaves`

**Decision:** the 1834 Dearborn Street drawbridge gains four things it did not have between
2026-08-11 and 2026-08-21 — **knee braces and shores in its gallows frames**, **a hoist chain
each side of the deck at each frame**, **the joint timber of a closed two-leaf draw**, and **a
railed deck**. The owner asked for it in as many words on 2026-08-18: *"the whole bridge area
needs to be improved."*

**Why, and it is a change of EVIDENCE rather than a change of mind.** Everything this record
refused to build, it refused on the strength of two TEXTS — Andreas's paragraph and the
chicagology page that transcribes it — and as a reading of a text the refusal was right and
still is. Neither names a chain, a leaf, a brace or a rail. What the project acquired on
2026-08-18 is a second kind of evidence: two engravings of this crossing, recorded at
`data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md`, images 2 and 3. They draw the frames as
an A, chains falling from them to the draw, and the deck railed. Those are **tier-5 pictorial**
views — retrospective, drawn decades after 1835 — and this project's standing rule for one is
that it may drive massing, form, materials and setting as `inferred`, and may never drive a
coordinate. Three of the four rows are graded `inferred` on that footing. The fourth,
`draw_leaves`, is graded `reconstructed`, because it settles a MECHANISM and a plate is not
strong enough for that.

**What was invented, item by item, because none of it is on any plate at a scale that could
be measured:**

- **The bracing:** two knee braces per frame rising from the posts to the underside of the head
  timber, reaching 1.35 m inboard; one shore per post raking 2.85 m down the span away from the
  opening to the bearing line; 0.105 m and 0.125 m half-sections. The plate shows a braced
  frame, not a schedule of scantlings. Everything but "it was braced, visibly, above the deck"
  is this project's.
- **The chains:** two per frame, one each side of the deck, running from the underside of the
  head to the free end of that frame's leaf at the centre of the opening, outboard of the deck
  edge so nothing crosses the footway. Drawn taut and straight and as a 0.084 m run rather than
  as links — a chain carrying a closed leaf is in fact slack, and a catenary of links would be
  thousands of triangles for a sag nobody can see from the bank. Their colour is a local
  wrought-iron value declared in `generators/archetypes/bridge_timber.py`, because the material
  sheet holds no metal at all (T-0007 owns that gap).
- **The two leaves:** a bearing timber across the deck at each end of the opening, an edge beam
  down each side of each leaf, and the two leaves' ends butted at the centre of the draw with a
  25 mm joint between them. **No leaf is raised.** The deck boards run straight through
  underneath and the timber stands 55 mm proud — a threshold, not a step — so the crossing is
  exactly as walkable as it was and a visitor is shown where the bridge opened without being
  told it is open.
- **The railing:** 0.95 m rails on posts at about 2.2 m, which are the numbers
  `bridge_timber._railing` has carried unused since 2026-08-10. No source gives a height, a
  spacing or a section for this bridge. The archetype's default of no railing is unchanged and
  so is its argument, which is entirely about the two LOG bridges over the branches: the 1883
  old-settlers statement has THOSE two 'without railings, for the first few years'.

**Consequence.** The most conspicuous object on the crossing was already the one the confidence
view dithers hardest — the frames, whose height nothing states — and this entry adds three more
dithered things around it. That is the right way round and it is also a warning: a visitor who
turns the confidence view off sees a considered piece of civil engineering, and the honest
statement is that its silhouette is a nineteenth-century engraver's and its dimensions are
ours. The one claim the mesh still refuses is a leaf in the air.

**The contamination risk, stated because it is the reason this is a liberty and not a finding.**
Every modern retelling of this bridge calls it double-leaf and worked by chains, and neither
word is in either underlying text; on the chicagology page they belong to the 1890s bascule and
the 1907 and 1963 bridges. A retrospective engraver had the same problem and fewer scruples, so
a plate drawn in the 1880s may be reporting the 1834 mechanism or importing a later one. That is
precisely why the arrangement is labelled at its tier rather than argued into the texts, and why
`form.draw_lifting_gear` still records all three readings of the written evidence and asserts
none of them.

**How to resolve:** the February 1834 proposals Andreas mentions, the trustees' specification,
the twenty-five-dollar premium drawing, or the repair accounts of September 1834 and 1835. Any
of the four would replace a plate with a number. A contemporary — not retrospective — view of
the river mouth looking west would settle the silhouette on its own.

**Decision:** the north bank of the main stem at the Dearborn drawbridge carries **four low
freight sheds** where it carried nothing — one west of the bridge line and three downstream of it,
standing back from North Water Street with their wagon doors to the river street. **Not one of them
is attested.** Every value on all four records is graded `reconstructed`, including the fact that a
building stood there at all, and all four disappear with the rest of the reconstructed tier when a
visitor turns it off.

**Why:** the owner's brief of 2026-08-18 supplied an engraving of this reach from farther out —
image 3, written up at `data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md` — and what it draws
below the bridge is *masts crowding the reach, a light structure near the mouth, and low warehouses
on the banks*. The ground either side of the Dearborn crossing was empty in this model until this
run. The standing ruling of the same day grades the answer: *"you are totally fine to be liberal
with adding reconstructed items when i ask for things, you can just label and mark them as such."*
T-0133 is the ticket; T-0071 is the parent ask, whose first half built the bridge itself (**L163**).

**What the plate is allowed to decide, and what it is not.** Image 3 is **tier-5 pictorial** —
retrospective, drawn decades after 1835 — so under this project's standing rule it may drive
massing, form, materials and setting, and it may never drive a coordinate. It therefore decides
**that** working sheds stood on this bank and roughly what they looked like. It decides nothing
about which station, which size, which pitch or which door, and none of those were read off it.

**WHERE is derived, and the derivation is the honest part of the record.** Two committed things and
one stated offset: the drawn track of **North Water Street** (`data/streets/1835.json`,
`track_width_m` 6.0) puts the front wall 2.00 m back from the track's north edge at each station,
squared to the street's own bearing there; and the **committed heightfield**
(`data/terrain/epochs/e1834_harbor_cut`) has to carry every corner on modelled ground above the
water with no more than 0.35 m of relief across the rectangle — the same clause the infill
generators hold themselves to. Both are re-checkable by hand from the numbers in each
`position.note`. No derivation `method` in the schema can recompute it, so all four declare
`not_derivable` and write the rule out instead.

**What was invented, item by item.** The four stations. The four footprints — 20 x 32, 24 x 36,
18 x 34 and 28 x 44 ft, drawn inside family **F1**'s own band (18 x 32 to 28 x 50 ft) in
`data/reconstruction/1835_building_inventory.json`, frontage short and depth running back from the
street, which is the crosswalk's F1 shape. The eave heights, 11 to 12.8 ft inside F1's 10-13 ft
band. The roofs: three gables at 27, 30 and 33 degrees and one shed at 23, all inside F1's 5:12 to
9:12. The construction: vertical boarding on three, **hewn log on one**, which is there to break
the row — four sheds built to one specification would claim they were built together, and nothing
supports that. The wagon doors, their side, and the unpainted boards. **The dates**: the range
opens on 1834-08-01, the day the bridge record opens, because the reason to stand a shed on this
particular reach is the traffic the crossing brought to it.

**They stand back from the water, and that is a decision this entry owns.** The front walls are
4.5 to 10.5 m from the traced 1834 waterline with the river street between them and it, not on the
bank edge where a plate viewed from downstream reads them. Two things put them there: the modelled
bank at this reach climbs from the water to the plateau in three to four metres, so a building on
the slope fails the relief clause above rather than standing on the bank; and the one **attested**
river frontage this project holds a picture of — image 11, South Water Street in 1834 — is exactly
this relation, a working row facing the river across the river street with the bank left open. The
honest statement is that the plate would have them nearer the water and the terrain will not take
them there yet. **T-0004** (raise and graduate the banks) is the parcel that would change the
answer.

**The south bank is empty for a measured reason and not an oversight.** The same plate shows
warehouses on both banks. At the Dearborn reach the platted **South Water Street** corridor runs to
within about 1.7 m of the traced 1834 waterline, so there is no ground on that side for a building
that is not standing in the platted street — and this project's corridor ratchet refuses a new one
by construction. That measurement is its own ticket rather than a liberty, because nothing was
invented to get around it.

**What this costs the count.** The inventory's district matrix allows the **north** division one
warehouse-or-freight roof and the Kinzie and Hunter forwarding store already stands on it. These
four are therefore recorded in
`data/reconstruction/1835_existing_roof_reconciliation.json` as substituting **zero** anonymous
slots: they are an addition above the district's estimate rather than a substitution inside it, and
the programme file reports the excess rather than hiding it. The estimate is a reconstruction too,
and the plate is evidence about this bank that the estimate did not have.

**How to resolve:** a lot record for the north bank below Dearborn, a forwarding merchant's
advertisement giving an address on this reach, or any contemporary — not retrospective — view of
the north bank. Identifying image 3 against the Andreas/chicagology plate numbering and making it a
source record (**T-0075**) would not upgrade the buildings, but it would let these records cite a
`source_id` instead of a committed path.

### L165 — The Wolf Tavern's sign: the pole it flies from, and the wolf painted on it

**Decision:** the tavern's signboard no longer hangs from a bracket on the wall. It flies from a
**cross-arm at the head of a sapling** standing in front of the building, on two iron hinge straps,
and the board carries a **flat dark silhouette of a wolf** on both faces. Every dimension of the
arrangement is the archetype's: the pole stands `POLE_ABOVE_RIDGE_M` = 2.55 m over the ridge with a
7.4 m floor under that, `POLE_BUTT_R` = 0.105 m at the butt tapering to 0.072 m, set 0.40 m into the
ground and 1.15 m out from the facade, the arm reaches 1.52 m, the board is 0.92 × 0.68 × 0.055 m
hung 0.17 m under the arm, and the wolf fills about four fifths of it. Where along the front it
stands — 1.85 m off the door's centre, clear of the doorway — is the archetype's too. The outline
itself is `generators/archetypes/log_dwelling.py` `_WOLF_UV`: a standing canine in profile, ears up,
brush low, no attitude and no ground line.

**Why:** because the source describes all three things and the model was carrying none of them.
chicagology's Wolf's Point note (`chicagology_prefire273`): *"Wentworth was ambitious, and wanted a
sign to attract wayfarers. Lieutenant Allen made one for him out of a piece of a box. He painted a
picture of a wolf on it. The fort blacksmith made hinges, and the wolf sign was hung on a sapling.
The tavern was the first institution to have a sign board in Chicago."* A sapling is a standing
trunk, not a wall bracket; hinges are ironwork, not a bare board; and a picture of a wolf was on it.
That passage sits in a NOTE at the foot of the page rather than in the 1857 magazine body which
earned `chicagology_prefire273` its tier 2, and it names no author and cites nothing — which is
the ceiling on the whole arrangement, and the reason `form.sign_mount` reads `inferred`.
The 2026-08-18 owner brief's engraving of this tavern (image 4) draws the same thing from the
outside — a mast-tall pole with a cross-arm and the board flying from it, which the owner read as
*"almost like a flag"* — and a tier-5 pictorial view may drive form as `inferred`, which is the
grade `form.sign_mount` carries.

**The wolf is the part that needed a decision, and it reverses one this project made.** **L25** held
that the board must stay blank because a wolf painted from imagination would be the most
conspicuous fabrication in the scene. The risk was real and the conclusion was wrong: a source says
a picture of a wolf was on that board, so an EMPTY board asserts the opposite of the evidence, in
the one place every visitor walks up to. What is lost is the draughtsmanship, not the subject, and
the three-tier vocabulary exists for exactly that gap — build at the lowest tier that honestly
carries it and say what bounded the invention (AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER; the owner's
standing ruling of 2026-08-18 says the same in his own words). The bounds: the plainest reading of
"a picture of a wolf", in the one pigment a sign painter at the forks had — lampblack in oil, which
is why it is drawn at 0.116/0.098/0.086 and not at black — laid flat on box stock, carrying no
snarl, no landscape and no lettering, because each of those would be a second invention resting on
the first.

**Consequence:** the most famous object at Wolf Point is now visible from most of the west side and
carries a device a visitor will read as a wolf. That device is ours. Nobody has seen the board since
the 1830s and no description of the painting survives; a visitor who assumes the silhouette is
recovered iconography is assuming more than the confidence chip says, which is why this entry, and
not the chip, is where the distinction is legible. The pole's height is the other soft number: it
was chosen so the sign clears the roof it advertises, which is what "to attract wayfarers" needs,
and nothing states it.

**How to resolve:** a period depiction of the board itself, or the engraving in image 4 identified
against the Andreas/chicagology plate numbering and held as a source record (**T-0075**) at a
resolution that shows the device. Neither would recover the drawing; both would replace a
reconstruction with a citation for the arrangement.

### L166 — The goods say what they are: a stencil, a brand and a shipping mark on 148 casks and cases, every word of them dealt
**Decision:** every barrel and every packing case on `data/yard/town_trade_goods.json` now carries
a **MARK** — 102 casks and 46 cases, at 26 named trading frontages, **70 distinct marks** in three
letterforms. A cask carries a stencilled **commodity word** (FLOUR, PORK, SALT, WHISKEY, LINSEED
OIL, POTASH…), except every third one, which carries the **house's own brand** burned into its
head (P. F. W. PECK, NEWBERRY & DOLE, GREEN TREE TAVERN). A case carries a **shipping mark** — the
consignee over CHICAGO, and the forwarding houses' cases add FROM BUFFALO. The marks are dealt by
`tools/generate_yard_goods.py`, re-derived byte for byte by `tools/check.sh`, and painted by
`renderers/web/js/yard.js` onto one canvas atlas, so a mark costs no triangles and the layer keeps
its one material.
**Why:** because **L131 said the opposite and the owner overruled it**. That entry's decision read
*"No barrel carries a brand, a merchant's name, a stencil or a mark, and no case is labelled"* —
L25's discipline for the one documented sign, generalised twice. The owner, **2026-08-18,
verbatim: "you can add period correct names and brands and labels to things."** It is the third
time the same restraint has been overruled by the same person on the same day — the wagons
(L162), the signs (L159, T-0066) — and his standing ruling of that day is the tier: *"you are
totally fine to be liberal with adding reconstructed items when i ask for things, you can just
label and mark them as such."*
**What bounds the invention, and this is the whole of the fence.** A mark may say **three things
and nothing else**.
1. **The house's own name**, which is not invented at all: it is the record's name, the same
   string the signboard over the door paints (`_house_mark` takes the possessive owner out of it,
   so "P. F. W. Peck's Store" brands P. F. W. PECK and "Tremont House (the first)" brands TREMONT
   HOUSE). A cask at Peck's door and the board above it therefore agree, which is the point.
2. **A commodity word out of the trade's OWN attested description.** The dossiers write these
   businesses up in their own advertisements' words — Peck *"advertising dry goods, hardware and
   groceries"*, Brewster & Hogan *"dealers in dry goods, groceries and hardware"*, Jones's
   *"grocery and provision store"* (`docs/research/04-structures-south.md`). So the CATEGORY a
   stencil names is the source's; what is invented is only which word of that category lands on
   which cask. Six stock lists, one per trade class, are on the record as `mark_rule.stocks`.
3. **A destination and one port.** A case in transit carried its consignee and where it was going,
   so the cases read the house over CHICAGO. The forwarding houses' cases name where they came
   from, and the port is not free either: BUFFALO is the lake head this project has in writing —
   the schooner *Jackson* from Buffalo, 1833-06-27, and the *Illinois* into the river in 1834.
**Nothing else.** No trademark, no maker this town is not recorded as dealing with, no price, no
date, no slogan, no lot number. A word that is neither the house's own name nor a period commodity
of its own attested trade does not go on a barrel.
**What is invented, plainly.** That any of these particular casks carried any mark at all on
1 July 1835; which word each one carries; that every third cask was branded rather than stencilled;
that the cases were marked to Chicago and that the forwarding houses' came from Buffalo rather than
from anywhere else. **The trading house's list is held deliberately short** — flour, salt, powder
and tobacco — and nothing on it names or depicts the people that house traded with, which is
AGENTS.md's standing constraint and is not relaxed by a barrel.
**The letterforms are invented too, exactly as the boards' are (L159).** A browser ships no 1830s
specimen book, so three faces approximate the period's working hands: a condensed, widely tracked
STENCIL drawn with the bridges a cut plate has to leave; a roman BRAND in a browner ink, because a
brand is scorched wood and not paint; and a plain upright SHIPPING mark, brush-written. What they
have to do is be legible from the footway and not read as modern type.
**How it is drawn, and what it costs.** One canvas atlas, 8 columns of 192 px cells, one cell per
distinct mark plus a white one. Every vertex on the layer that carries no mark samples the white
cell, and white multiplies to nothing — so a wagon, a fence rail of a shed and an unmarked stave
are drawn exactly as they were before this layer had a texture. **No triangle was added and no
draw call was added**: the marks ride on the same single material and the same `CHUNK_M` buckets.
**Consequence:** a visitor who walks up to the casks outside Peck's store can read what is in them,
and no source says any of those particular barrels held anything. The confidence view still takes
the whole layer away at `reconstructed`, marks and all, because the mark cannot be more certain
than the barrel it is painted on.
**Ticket:** T-0065, from the owner's brief of 2026-08-18. **Supersedes L131's "no marks" clause**;
L131 keeps its reasoning verbatim and gains a pointer here. Related: **L159** (the boards' names

### L167 — "Vacant" and "to let" on 118 anonymous roofs: a title composed from an ABSENCE in the residents layer
**Decision:** the anonymous reconstruction programme's 222 roofs no longer show their production
identity as the title of their card (**T-0076**, the owner on 2026-08-18: *"give the locations
useful names not technical D3 #03 names, you can have that somewhere on the card for reference
identity purposes but dont make it the title"*). `renderers/web/js/display-name.js` composes the
title a visitor reads from the record and the residents layer: **"The Pratt house"** where a
household lives there, **"Newell's stable"** where one only works there, **"A privy"** for an
outbuilding — and, where the residents layer places nobody, **"A vacant one-room frame cottage"**
or, for premises a town would have advertised, the 1830s phrasing **"A narrow two-story store, to
let"**.

**The liberty is the last of those and only the last of those.** The first three are compositions
of data already recorded and graded: the household is the residents layer's own inferred household,
the description is the archetype's own, and both keep their chips. **The fourth asserts an
absence.** No source says any of these roofs stood empty on 1 July 1835. What is true is narrower
and duller: the inferred-household programme (**K1** phase two) places the households the town's
demonstrable trades require — 104 of the 222 — and stops, so the other 118 are **unmodelled**, not
attested empty. "Vacant" and "to let" are therefore a reading of our own dataset's edge, presented
in the town's voice.

**Why it was taken rather than refused.** The alternative is a title that says nothing at all — a
part number, which is what the owner objected to — or a hedge in the largest text on the card
("occupancy not modelled"), which is a sentence about this project rather than about 1835. A town
of 3,265 people did not have 118 empty houses in it, and the honest half of that is that the model
does not know who was in them. So the title speaks plainly and **the card carries the
qualification directly beneath it**, in the same block as the RECONSTRUCTED flag: no household is
recorded here, which is not evidence that it stood empty.

**Nothing in the dataset moved.** `sidecar.name` is untouched — it is what the parcel recipes
re-derive, what the GLBs are named for, and what the release gate's naming assertion reads — and
it is printed on the card as the reference line, and searchable, exactly as the owner asked.

**How to resolve:** extend the residents layer until it reaches every roof, at which point the
vacancy titles disappear on their own; or record occupancy as a graded ATTRIBUTE of the record
rather than as the absence of a link, which would let a card say *reconstructed: unoccupied* with a
chip on it like every other claim here.

**Ticket:** T-0076, from the owner's brief of 2026-08-18. Related: **L1** (the town draws no
people, which is why a household reaches a visitor only as text), **L81** (the anonymous roofs
themselves, none of them a recovered building), **L84** (the households nobody named), **L94** (the
rule that decides which roof gets an occupant — the same edge, one layer down).
**Recorded:** 2026-08-22.

### L168 — The stack is not the roof: brick on 112 framed buildings, cat-and-clay on 31 log cabins
**Decision:** every chimney stack this town's Blender archetypes build now carries a masonry
material of its own instead of the ROOF material it was built with. **157 stacks on 143 buildings**
(measured off the resolved parameters of the committed masters): brick on the 112 framed
buildings — `frame_dwelling`, `frame_storefront`, `frame_tavern` — and a stick-and-clay daub on the
31 log dwellings. `docs/RESEARCH/chimneys.md` is the argument in full; this is what was invented.

**What is NOT invented, and it is most of it.** The COUNT of stacks is the record's, on every
building. The POSITION is the archetype's and **L26** has owned it since the archetypes were
written — an interior stack at the gable of a framed house, an exterior stack against the gable of
a log cabin — and nothing here moves one by a millimetre. The DISPOSITION each fabric follows from
was already committed prose: `log_dwelling._stack` has always said its stack is *"a stick-and-clay
or fieldstone stack built against the gable"* so it *"can be pulled away from the building when it
catches fire"*, and `frame_dwelling._chimneys` has always said its stack *"rising inside the wall and
breaking the roof at the ridge"*. Those two sentences described two materials while the renderer
painted both of them the colour of the roof.

**The brick is INFERRED and is not a new number.** It is `frame_tavern`'s committed `BRICK_RGBA`
(0.45/0.23/0.17 linear, roughness 0.85), which **L154** already records as read off the Petford
watercolour of the Sauganash — the one coloured witness in this repository to any Chicago chimney,
and it says *brick*. What T-0008 adds is the generalisation from that one building to the other
111, and the warrant for it is the town's own: Blodgett's brick-yard opened on the North Side in
the spring of 1833 (`brickyard_north_side`, Andreas p. 1161) and the Lake House went up in brick in
1835. An interior flue through a timber roof has to be masonry, and this is the masonry that was
being made two blocks away. The Sauganash's own masters are byte-for-byte unchanged, which is the
proof the value did not move.

**The clay is RECONSTRUCTED, and this is the invention.** Nothing in this repository attests any
log house's stack — not its fabric, not its colour, not that it existed beyond the record's count.
The tone is bounded rather than read, by two values already shipping: it cannot be as pale as the
CHINKING it is daubed with (0.700/0.670/0.590), which is the same clay sheltered under an eave
while a stack takes weather and smoke on every face; and it cannot be as dark as the palest ROOF
CONDITION (`weathered`, 0.424/0.384/0.345), or it stops reading as masonry against the roof beside
it, which is the whole defect this parcel fixes. Nothing states where between the two it sits, so
it sits at the **midpoint to three decimals: 0.562/0.527/0.468**, at the sheet's `earth` roughness
of 0.95 because the surface is daub. **Fieldstone is the other half of `log_dwelling`'s own
sentence and is not built** — a stone stack is a different silhouette as well as a different
colour, and choosing between the two per building would need evidence nobody has. One treatment,
declared.

**What a visitor sees.** A brick-red stack on the framed houses and stores, a pale clay stack on
the log cabins, and in both cases a chimney that no longer disappears into the roof it passes
through. The confidence view is unchanged: a stack still carries its record's `chimneys`
confidence, so hiding `reconstructed` hides exactly what it hid before.

**Not covered here.** The fort's ten garrison stacks were left roof-coloured by this parcel — 1816,
federal ground, four constructions, and neither answer above reached them. **T-0137 has since
answered them on the fort's own evidence, on 2026-08-28, and they take the brick above**: brick is
attested inside that fort twice over (Hubbard's "the brick building, just within the north stockade"
and "the magazine, of brick"), so those flues never needed Blodgett's yard, and
`fort_structure._chimneys` builds an interior stack, which is the disposition this entry answers
with brick. It is INFERRED and invents nothing, so it adds no liberty of its own;
`docs/RESEARCH/chimneys.md` §6 is the argument. The stand-in massing
generator kept its own `#89503F` brick, about 20 % apart in linear red from this one, until
**T-0138** pointed it at this row on 2026-08-28 — a convergence that repaints nothing, because
all 230 of those buildings have since been baked from their archetypes and no placeholder GLB
ships. And nothing here says what any roof was COVERED with; R-W2a finding 2 stands.

**How to resolve:** a source describing a Chicago chimney — an insurance survey, a builder's
account, a recollection naming brick or clay at a named house — promotes §2 to attested for that
building and replaces §3 outright.

**Ticket:** T-0008, opened by R-W2a finding 1 as ROADMAP **R-W2c**. Related: **L26** (every
chimney's position, which this does not touch), **L154** (the Sauganash's brick, read off the
plate), **L157** (the material sheet painting the town, and the roof's weathering that is not its
covering).

### L170 — The North Division's sixty roofs are sixty buildings now: every width, depth and eave drawn inside the family band instead of one figure per family
**Decision:** the sixty anonymous roofs of the North Division parcel take their footprint and their
eave height from the reconstruction specification's per-family BAND, sampled deterministically on a
stable per-record key, by the same module the phase-one south blocks and the fourteen platted blocks
already use (`tools/family_bands.py`). Before this they took one retyped width, one retyped depth and
one retyped eave per family, so twenty-three families stood for sixty buildings: **thirty-six of the
sixty were an exact twin of another roof in the same parcel**, and **seventeen carried an eave height
outside the band their own note cited** — a note claiming a range while the value sat below it.

**WHAT IS INVENTED, and it is exactly what was invented before.** That any of these sixty buildings
stood at all; where each one stood; how big it was. Nothing here promotes a single value: every
dimension still grades `reconstructed`, still cites the specification's family band as a TYPOLOGY
rather than as evidence about this building, and still says in its own note that no individual
dimensions are documented. **Sampling adds variety, not knowledge.** What changed is that a band
authored as a range is now used as a range, instead of being collapsed to a point and then contradicted.

**Why uniformity was itself a claim.** Twenty-four massings dealt sixty times is a statement about the
North Division — that its houses were built to a pattern — and no source makes it. The uniformity was
never argued for; it was an artefact of where the numbers were typed. A visitor reading the horizon
north of the river was being shown a regularity this project cannot support, and that is a stronger
claim than the invented sizes it was made of.

**The one number that moved to fit an archetype rather than a source**, recorded because L148 records
the same thing for the block parcel: a family whose authored eave band dips below the height its
archetype needs to header its own door is sampled from the part of the band the archetype can build —
2.05 m for a man door, more for a wagon or stable door, asked of the archetype's own door table rather
than retyped. A family whose WHOLE band sits under that floor fails loudly instead of being quietly
raised out of its own typology. Nothing was widened to make a check pass.

**What this deliberately does NOT touch.** Roof pitch. The specification authors pitch as a band too
(`7:12-10:12` for most families) and couples it to a committed `ridge_ft` band, so sampling the pitch
without gating the ridge would put ridges outside a band their own note cites — the exact fault this
entry is repairing, moved one field over. Eleven North records still carry a pitch outside their cited
band, all of them within half a 1:12 step of its edge, and they are owed to their own ticket rather
than folded in here.

**Consequence:** the town north of the river reads as sixty separately-built roofs rather than two
dozen repeated ones — different widths, different depths, different eave lines along the same
cluster — and the seventeen records whose note cited a band they stood outside now stand inside it.
The 665-roof total does not move, no record is added or removed, and no position changes except the
one slot the recipe already shifted for terrain.

**How to resolve:** any parcel-by-parcel register of North Division roofs for July 1835 — a tax list,
an insurance description, an itemised loss list — would replace a sampled rectangle with a measured
one on the same line, which is what the 665-roof programme's substitution clause exists for.

**Ticket:** T-0011, from ROADMAP **T-V1(a)**'s census. Related: **L148** (the same rule on the platted
blocks, and the same door-headroom floor), ROADMAP **T-V1(b)** for the circular dependency that parked

### L171 — The North parcel's pitches sampled from their own band, and the ridge gated so the repair did not move the fault one field over

**Decision:** the sixty anonymous North Division records take their `roof_pitch_deg` from the
family's authored rise:run band — the `7:12-10:12` in the crosswalk's `roof` column — instead of
the one constant per family that `tools/generate_north_infill.py` had retyped into Python, and
the sample is **constrained by the family's `ridge_ft` band**: where part of the pitch band would
put the ridge outside the ridge band, the sampler draws from the part that does not.
`recon_1835_north_w5_040`'s loft is taken from the family's `levels` string in the same pass, which
is where it should always have come from — W5 authors "1", flat, and a retyped tuple had given it a
loft the specification never mentions. Every one of these values still grades `reconstructed` and
still cites the band as a typology rather than as evidence about the building.

**Why:** T-0144 moved footprint, storeys and eave onto their bands and deliberately stopped short of
the pitch, because a pitch is not a dimension that stands on its own. It and the footprint together
make the RIDGE, the crosswalk authors a band for that too, and repairing ten pitches into their band
while pushing ten ridges out of theirs would have been the same fault one field over. So the pitch
moved and the ridge gained an instrument in the same commit: `tools/measure_ridge_band.py` models
every reconstructed roof's ridge from the archetype's own roof arithmetic (`tools/ridge_model.py`),
checks that model against the ridge the committed GLB actually carries, and ratchets the residual.
Ten North pitches and one North loft came inside their bands; seventeen North ridges came inside
theirs; the dataset-wide count of roofs standing outside their ridge band fell from 121 to 104.

**What it does NOT do, and this is the honest half.** It does not put every North ridge in its band,
and it will not, because for several families **no pitch inside the authored pitch band can reach
the authored ridge band at the footprint the family authors**. The A1 stable is the clearest case:
the outbuilding archetype runs a gable ridge down the LONG axis, so the roof climbs half the SHORT
one, and an A1 drawn inside its own footprint band cannot reach a 17 ft ridge at 10:12 — the steepest
pitch A1 allows. Four North roofs stay outside their ridge band for that reason and are banked, with
a hundred more across the rest of the town that this parcel did not touch. Leaving the pitch band to
reach the ridge band would have satisfied a gate by disobeying the other committed claim, so the
sampler stays inside the pitch band and the conflict is filed as its own ticket rather than papered
over by a pitch nobody claims.

**Consequence:** sixty roofs that stood at twenty-four pitches now stand at sixty, and the town's
North side reads as sixty buildings rather than a family repeated. A visitor who hides
`reconstructed` loses all of it. A reader who compares a record's pitch against the crosswalk will
now find it inside the band it cites — and, for a hundred and four roofs across the town, will find
the ridge over it outside the band beside it, which `tools/ridge_band_baseline.json` states in full
rather than leaving to be discovered.

**How to resolve:** a decision on which of the two committed bands gives way where an archetype
cannot satisfy both — the pitch band, the ridge band, or the archetype's ridge orientation. That is
the owner's call about the specification and not a repair an agent should make; it is the ticket.

**Recorded:** 2026-08-22.


### L176 — Six anonymous roofs take a taller eave from their own band, because their ridge band could not be reached from the one they were dealt

**Decision:** the two anonymous parcels that draw their dimensions from the family bands —
`tools/generate_north_infill.py` and `tools/generate_block_infill.py` — now draw the EAVE
under the same constraint they already drew the pitch under. Where the eave a stable key
lands on cannot reach the family's authored `ridge_ft` band at any pitch the family also
authors, the eave is redrawn from the part of its OWN band that can, and the pitch then
falls where the existing sampler puts it. Five A1 stables and one A4 shed moved: eaves from
2.750-2.874 m to 2.840-3.413 m, and one down from 2.405 m to 2.336 m, with pitches following
to between 39.2 and 39.8 degrees on the five stables. Every value is still inside the band
its own note cites, still grades `reconstructed`, and still says the band is a typology
rather than evidence about that building. Nothing else in the town moved: the other 251
reconstructed roofs re-derive byte for byte.

**Why, and this is the part that is a finding rather than a repair.** T-0145 built the ridge
instrument and banked 104 roofs outside their ridge band, and read the residual as
structural — "for several families no pitch inside the authored pitch band can reach the
authored ridge band at the footprint the family authors". L171 recorded that as an open
question for the owner: which of the four claims gives way, the footprint band, the pitch
band, the ridge band, or the archetype's ridge orientation.

**None of them does.** `tools/measure_ridge_reach.py` sweeps every family's whole authored
footprint band and asks whether ANY eave inside the eave band and ANY pitch inside the pitch
band lands the ridge inside the ridge band. At every footprint of every family that authors
a pitch band, the answer is yes. The four claims are jointly satisfiable everywhere, and the
sentence T-0145 wrote was true only because it held the eave at whatever the record happened
to carry. The eave is not a fixed thing — it is the second of two values the crosswalk
authors as a band and the samplers draw from — so a ridge band is reachable or not from a
(footprint, eave) PAIR, and constraining only the pitch made the second free claim carry the
first one's choice. The A1 stable, the case L171 named as the clearest, reaches its 17-24 ft
ridge band comfortably at an eave in the top half of the 9-12 ft its own family authors.

**What is still outside its band, said plainly.** Fifty-eight roofs, down from sixty-four,
and all fifty-eight are in the three parcels that do not sample at all: `west_infill`,
`inferred_infill` and `inferred_households` still carry the per-family constants T-0144 and
T-0145 took out of the North parcel, and a ridge is downstream of an eave that was typed
rather than drawn. That is T-0172's, named there before this ran, and the report in
`tools/measure_ridge_reach.py` prints the split by parcel so it cannot be mistaken for a
specification fault again. The two parcels that DO sample now carry none.

**Consequence:** five stables and a shed stand between 5 and 55 cm taller, which is visible
from beside them and nowhere else, and the ridge gate's residual is now entirely a list of
records waiting for a generator to be repaired rather than a mixture of that and an argument
about the specification. The five stables also cluster at the steep end of A1's pitch band,
40 degrees against the 30-40 the family allows, and that is the arithmetic being honest: a
small stable whose ridge runs down its long axis needs its family's steepest roof to reach
its family's lowest ridge.

**How to resolve:** nothing to resolve in the specification — the sweep is now a gate, so a
future crosswalk edit that authors a family which cannot be built to its own ridge band fails
at the specification instead of arriving as a roof nobody can raise. What remains open is
T-0172 for the three retyped parcels, and the three families whose roof line offers a SHED
their ridge band cannot carry at most footprints (C1, F1, F4) — filed, and not built as a
shed by any generator today.

### L173 — Nine piles of brick, timber and stone on the one lot this town can say was building
**Decision:** the Lake House site — `lake_house_construction`, a roofless brick shell on the north
side — now has **building material stacked round it**: four stacks of brick along the frontage it
faces Michigan Street with, three piles of squared timber down its east flank, and two heaps of
footing stone behind it. Nine piles, on one lot, on `data/yard/lot_building_material.json`, dealt by
`tools/generate_lot_building_material.py`, re-derived byte for byte by `tools/check.sh`, and drawn
by `renderers/web/js/yard.js` on the yard layer's own material and in its own `CHUNK_M` buckets.
**Why:** because **Ordinance 9 names five things and this project had drawn two of them.** The
village corporation of 7 November 1833 legislated about *timber, stone, brick, boxes and barrels*
stacked in the streets (`data/sources/chicago_democrat_1833_11_26.json`, tier 1), and a corporation
does not legislate against a thing nobody does. T-0040 drew the boxes and the barrels — a
merchant's stock on his own frontage, L131 — and refused the other three in writing, because they
are a different claim about a different kind of ground: building material belongs to a building
that is going UP, and the goods record has no way to say which lot was.
**What decides which lot, and it is the whole parcel.** The record has to SAY it. Of 343 structures
standing on the scene date, 256 are anonymous infill and 87 are named; exactly one carries a
construction state in its own attributes — `lake_house_construction`, whose `function` is
`hotel_under_construction` and whose grade on that attribute is **attested**, off Andreas ('the
hotel was completed and thrown open to the public in the autumn of 1836') and corroborated by
J. D. Bonnell, who walked past 'the Lake House IN COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION' on 25 August 1835. Its
`roof_type` is `none` for the same reason. **No date test is used and refusing to write one is
half the finding**: a `documented_range.from` inside 1835 is a FIRST ATTESTATION for the named
records — a newspaper's first issue, a directory line, a deed — and a PROGRAMME date for the
anonymous ones, which L126 states in as many words. Fourteen named records carry an 1835 opening
and every one is refused by name, with that reason, in the record's `refused` block.
**What is invented, plainly.** That any material stood on that lot on 1 July 1835; how much;
where each pile stood; the stack of brick at 2.20 × 1.10 × 1.05 m; the 12 ft × 8 in squared stick,
five to a course and four or five courses high with the top course short; the nine-block heap of
rough footing stone; and the working strip itself — 1.60 m off the wall, 1.00 m clear of each
corner, one material to a face beginning at the face the record fronts. Not one of those numbers
is attested for Chicago or for this site.
**What bounds it.** WHICH materials is not free: brick because the record's `construction` is brick
and `attested` in Andreas's own words ('this hotel, which was built of brick, was three stories and
a basement in height'), and Blodgett's brickyard had been running on the North Side since the
spring of 1833; stone because the same sentence gives the building a basement, and a basement is
masonry footing before it is anything else; timber because a three-storey brick building of the
period is floored, joisted and roofed in it and is laid from timber scaffolding — Martineau, in
the unfinished building in June 1836, sat on 'planks laid on trestles'. The pile SIZES are bounded
by what the material is for: a stick that spans a room of a building 15 m deep, a stone a
two-man lift can carry, a stack of brick a barrow can be worked round.
**Two things it deliberately does not draw.** **No individual brick and no course**:
`generators/common/materials.py` records that no source in this repository gives a brick or a
course dimension, so a course rhythm here would be a modern brick module wearing an 1835 date, and
the stack is drawn as stepped block instead. **Nothing in the street**, which is the nuisance the
ordinance actually legislated against: this site's own position note carries about 20 m of working
uncertainty and says which side of Rush Street it stands on is undocumented, while the traced
centreline of Michigan Street runs some 30 m north of where the same georeference puts the
frontage. Two numbers that disagree by more than the object is wide cannot place a stack of brick
in a roadway, so the material stands on the lot and the street half of Ordinance 9 stays undrawn.
**The colours.** Brick is **not a new colour**: it is `generators/common/materials.py`'s
`CHIMNEY_BRICK`, the town's one brick, off the Petford watercolour, and it goes into the renderer
as the sheet's own linear triple rather than through a hand conversion. Stone **is** new and is
reconstructed, because the material sheet's `stone` substrate carries a roughness and no colour at
all; it is bounded by two values this project already ships — paler and greyer than the yard
layer's own timber (`0x8a7a5f`), or a heap of footing stone stops reading as stone beside the
sticks piled next to it, and darker than the chinking clay (linear 0.700/0.670/0.590), which is
the same mineral sitting sheltered under an eave.
**Consequence:** the one building site in this town now looks like one — a roofless shell with its
material on the ground round it, instead of a walled rectangle standing on swept prairie. The whole
layer is graded `reconstructed` at the vertex, so a visitor who hides `reconstructed` gets the bare
site back, and aiming at any pile opens the Lake House's card. No new draw call: the piles ride the
yard layer's single material and its existing chunks.
**How to resolve:** a second building site — any record that states a construction state on
1835-07-01 gets material by the same rule the day it is written; a dated groundbreaking for the
Lake House, which today rests on two unfootnoted compilations the record disputes at length; a
measured Chicago brick of the 1830s, which would let a stack be drawn in courses; or a quarry for
north-side footing stone, which would give the heap a colour instead of a bound.
**Ticket:** T-0057, opened by T-0040. Related: **L131** (the boxes-and-barrels half of the same
ordinance), **L166** (the marks on those goods), **L126** (why an anonymous record's date is a
programme date), **L168** (the brick this borrows).
**Recorded:** 2026-08-23.

### L174 — The ground outside Fort Dearborn's walls is bare and trodden, twelve metres of it, on a rule
**Decision:** a band **12.0 m wide immediately outside Fort Dearborn's palisade, on all four
sides**, is treated as bare trodden earth: the prairie sward is suppressed there and the yard
layer's `trodden_earth` treatment is laid in its place. The band is `data/enclosures/
fort_dearborn_apron.json`, written by `tools/generate_fort_apron.py`, re-derived byte for byte by
`tools/check.sh`, and drawn by `renderers/web/js/yards.js` on the same material and in the same
buffer as the estray pen — no new surface and no new draw call.
**Why:** because **both committed Fort Dearborn plates draw that ground bare and the render grew
bluestem to the foot of the pickets.** T-0044's image-accuracy pass listed it seventh of eight
gaps. In `p4_0.png` — the fort from the north bank, the stand this project shoots it from — the
bare, pale, trodden ground runs from the wall foot past a walking figure to the crest of the bank,
with the track from the gate crossing it, and the sward only resumes beyond. Ground worked daily by
a garrison does not carry 1.5 m of prairie grass, and the layer already knew how to keep plants off
a road.
**What is invented, plainly.** The width. Twelve metres is one number for all four sides, and no
source states a foot of it. What bounds it: the plates, which are tier-5 pictorial and may drive
SETTING as `inferred` but may never drive a coordinate, and in which the bare ground scaled against
the fort's own 53 m side runs to the order of ten to twenty metres; and the fort road's own
`corridor_width_m`, which is the only other reconstructed distance this project has stated on this
reservation, so a second unrelated figure would imply a precision neither has. Invented too: that
the band stops square, where trodden ground fans out from a gate; and that the gate side is worn no
harder than the other three, which a real post's ground would contradict.
**What is NOT invented, and the difference is the whole reason this is a generated record.** Not
one coordinate is authored. Every ring is derived from `fort_dearborn_palisade`'s own committed
`footprint.polygon` and `placement` in the frame `docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md` fixes, so the ground follows
the fort if the fort is ever re-placed or re-sized — and the palisade's footprint is itself only
`inferred`, off the 1830 Harrison plan and Andreas, which this band inherits and can never be better
than. Four assertions run on every commit: the four bands tile the annulus with no overlap and no
gap; no band covers the parade inside the walls; the fort road's last traced point stands ON the
apron, so no collar of untouched prairie is left between the track and the wall; and no other
enclosure record already treats this ground.
**What this deliberately does NOT claim.** The ground INSIDE the walls. A single square would have
been simpler and would have laid a treatment over the parade, which is a second claim about ground
no committed plate shows; the apron is a frame of four bands instead, and the parade is left as it
is. It also does not clip the fort road: the road's last seven metres of track lie on the apron,
both are bare-earth drapes, both are `reconstructed`, and a travelled way crossing a trodden apron
is what the plate draws. And it does not touch the bank — nothing here regrades a metre of terrain,
and the north band stops itself at the water because the layer drops any cell whose foot is in the
river mask.
**How to resolve:** a garrison return or quartermaster's account describing the ground of the
reservation; an 1830s survey of the United States Reservation showing cleared ground; or an
identification of either plate against a dated original, which would raise it above the tier-5
standing that lets it drive setting and never a coordinate.
**Ticket:** T-0097, opened by T-0044. Related: **L158** (the ground-treatment scheme this rides),
**L155** (the fort's river frontage, cut steeper than the banks either side), and the fort road's
own record (the travelled way that arrives across this band).

### L175 — Sixty-four leaf sprays, because the frame was finally measured and it cost three per cent

**Decision:** the shrub archetype (**L122**, **L124**, **L125**) now carries **sixty-four** leaf
sprays where it carried forty-eight, at the same plate size again — 0.26–0.42 of the recorded clump
radius. Foliage cover over the bush's own outline goes **46.9 % → 51.3 %**, worst bearing **43.0 %
→ 47.3 %**, the fraction of the dark woody stems with foliage in front of them **51.3 % → 54.2 %**,
for **104 → 136 triangles** a shrub. ROADMAP **K59**, ticket **T-0020**.

**This is L125's own reserved 4.4 points, spent — and what it took was the measurement L125 could
not make.** K57 justified stopping at 48 on a triangle count and a draw-call count, and said in as
many words that neither is a frame. The shrub batch does not split — one instanced set, one draw
call, at either grain — so the real cost of a finer grain is fill and vertex work, and no
frame-time figure had ever been taken anywhere in this archetype's history. K59 therefore refused
to be claimed without one.

**What was measured.** `tools/measure_shrub_frame_cost.mjs`, new here, stands the walker in the wet
woods where 158 shrubs are drawn in one ring — the densest shrub community of the ten — sweeps
eight bearings and fixes the camera at the most expensive of them, holds the clock so the wind
cannot blow between two readings, drives frames one at a time instead of letting the browser pace
them, and fences each frame with a one-pixel readback:

| | 48 sprays | 64 sprays | |
|---|---|---|---|
| desktop 1280×800 | 4282.30 ms | 4410.30 ms | **+3.0 %** |
| mobile 390×780 | 2739.60 ms | 2795.80 ms | **+2.1 %** |
| desktop, the shipped grain measured AGAIN | 4292.90 ms | | **+0.2 %** against its own first reading |

That last row is the control, and it is why the 3.0 can be believed: the runner's own drift between
two readings of the identical scene is two tenths of a point, so the candidate's three points are
fifteen times it rather than inside it.

**What the figure is NOT.** These milliseconds are a fact about a headless software rasteriser
(ANGLE over SwiftShader) on a shared CI machine, and not about anyone's phone — a frame there is
four seconds. The tool prints the renderer string with every reading so no number can be quoted
without it. The RATIO is the answer, and it is an argument in the safe direction: a software
rasteriser is the most fill-sensitive renderer there is, so it is the harshest available witness
for the one risk here — 33 % more transparent plate over the same silhouette (overdraw 1.33 → 1.56).
A grain that costs three per cent there is not going to cost more on hardware.

**What is NOT claimed, and it is the same disclaimer L125 made.** No source in this repository
states a leaf-mass count for any of the twenty-one `shrub_low` records; the count is invented, as
it was at 16, at 32 and at 48, and this is the same invention at a finer setting. What is not
invented: the silhouette, which still reaches **0.997** of the recorded half-width and never leaves
the recorded height; the plate, which stays at 3.5× a 10 cm leaf so the mass abstraction does not
quietly become a claim to draw a leaf; and the census, which is identical plant for plant — no
shrub moved, appeared or vanished.

**Cost:** 104 triangles per shrub becomes 136, which in the ring measured here is **17,368 →
22,712**, 2.3 % of the 1,000,000 the `full` tier budgets. The gate in `tools/measure_spray_grain.mjs
--gate` — reach ≥ 0.95 of the recorded half-width, a spray ≥ 2× a leaf, coverage above 40 % at every
bearing — is unchanged and green on the new grain.

**How to resolve:** nothing to resolve — it is a rendering decision, reversible by one integer. What
would retire the whole line of them is the instrument L121, L156 and L174's tier work all ask for: a
frame-time reading on a real low-end machine rather than on a CI rasteriser.

recorded cover), and ROADMAP **K57**, **K59**.

### L179 — The point on a Fort Dearborn picket is ours, and the plate that was said to draw it rules a flat top

**Decision:** every picket of the fort's stockade is **sharpened over its top 0.312 m** — 8.4 % of
the 3.7 m height, cut out of that height rather than added to it — and **no source says a word
about the head of a Fort Dearborn picket.** The head is a reconstruction, and until now it was
declared nowhere: it lives in a derived property of `generators/archetypes/palisade_params.py`
(`picket_point_m = min(width × 1.3, height × 0.18)`), whose own docstring admits *"no source
describes the head of a Fort Dearborn picket"*, and neither the record nor this file had ever
repeated that where a reader would find it. **L47** covers the fabric of this wall in general terms
— "every dimension of the fabric is ours" — and names the height, the width, the spacing, the gate
and the bastions one by one. It does not name the head, and the head is the most conspicuous thing
about the wall at eye level.

**Why the head is built at all, and why it is not evidence.** A flat-topped post reads as a fence
rail and a pointed one reads as a stockade; the sawtooth is what makes a visitor at the north wall
see a fort rather than a paddock. That is a drawing argument, not a claim about 1816. Kinzie gives
"high pickets" and nothing else; Andreas gives "a square stockade"; the 1830 Harrison plan is a
plan and has no third dimension. The head is therefore **reconstructed** in this project's exact
sense — invented within bounds because the scene needs it — and the bound is one picket width,
which is the proportion a splitting axe leaves.

**And the plate does not settle it, which is the half this entry exists to record (T-0094).** The
ticket, and row 3 of `docs/RESEARCH/fort_dearborn_image_accuracy.md` before it, said the model's
pickets were flat-topped and the plate's pointed. **Both halves are wrong.** The committed master
`assets/gltf/fort_dearborn_palisade__picket_1816.glb` has carried 768 four-triangle heads since the
archetype was written — 3,072 apex vertices at 3.700 m over 12,288 shoulders at 3.388 m — and
`data/sources/assets/prefire_views_kevin_2026_08/p4_0.png` rules the curtain's top as a **straight
line**: 0.45 px rms over 138 resolved columns, while the same plate resolves individual pickets at
a 10 px pitch and stands the curtain 43 px tall, so a head of this proportion would have serrated
it by 3.6 px — eight times the residual. `p4_1` rules the same flat cap. **The draughtsman had the
resolution to draw a point and drew none.** That is not evidence that the pickets were flat: a
lithographer ruling the top of a distant stockade is what a lithographer does, and these are
tier-5 retrospective plates. It is evidence that the plate cannot be cited FOR the point.

**Consequence:** the silhouette of the most recognisable structure in the town is ours, top to
bottom — L47 already said so of its height and its posts, and this says so of their heads. The
confidence view dithers the whole wall, which is the only thing standing between a visitor and
that fact.

**How to resolve:** the same evidence L47 asks for — a quartermaster return, a repair estimate or
an engineer's report for the post between 1816 and 1836. A specification for pickets would settle
the head, the height and the spacing in one sentence.

**Held by:** `tools/measure_picket_plate.py --gate`, in `tools/check.sh`, which refuses a stockade
whose apexes have gone flat, been capped, worn under 4 % of the picket, or been stacked on top of a
full-height post. The plate half of that file reports and does not gate: a tier-5 lithograph may
refute a claim made about itself and may not hold a build red.

**No `Covers:` field, deliberately.** The head has no attribute of its own to claim — it is a
proportion the archetype derives, not a value the record states — and claiming
`form.construction` would put this entry's name on the word "log", which really is inferred and is
not the invention being confessed. The honest form is an entry that claims nothing in the
machine-readable field and says in prose exactly what was made up. The day a `picket_head`
attribute exists on the record, this entry claims it.

**Covers:** `fort_dearborn_palisade.picket_1816.form.picket_head_m`.
**Ticket:** T-0094, opened by T-0044, closed as refuted; **T-0200** claimed the attribute.

**Recorded:** 2026-08-24.
**Revised:** 2026-08-24 (T-0200), hours after it was written — **that day is today, so the "No
`Covers:` field, deliberately" paragraph under *Held by* is superseded and the field is
filled.** `form.picket_head_m` now
stands on `fort_dearborn_palisade`, `reconstructed`, at **0.312 m**: the identical number
`PalisadeParams.picket_point_m` had been deriving, asserted equal to the derivation before it was
written and then proved by a real bake — `fort_dearborn_palisade__picket_1816.glb` came back
**byte-for-byte the file that stood before**, 21,728 vertices, none moved. Only the manifest's
input hash changed, `579cb33f…` → `dd0c84b8…`, which is what a declaration is supposed to cost.
That paragraph is kept verbatim rather than deleted because it was the right reading of the
document and the wrong reading of the runner: **the head was deferred out of `form` for a reason
that was false.** T-0094 recorded that the attribute "cannot be in this run … there is no Blender on
this runner", and the pinned Blender 4.5.3 was installed on that runner the whole time. That was
the integrator's error, not the ticket author's finding, and it is corrected here, in T-0094 and
in `docs/STATUS.md` rather than quietly removed. What does NOT change: the head is still ours,
still `reconstructed`, still unattested by any source, and `p4_0` still rules the cap flat. The
derived proportion stays in the archetype as the fallback for any palisade record that states no
head — the garrison garden's worm fence resolves through the same class and states none; it was
rebaked too, because the new parameter restaled it, and it also came back byte-identical.


### L177 — The Lake face's street line is 0.80 m, and the plat module's lot margin gives way to it
**Decision:** the three roofs of the `blk_lake_clark` frontage run —
`recon_1835_blk_lake_clark_d1_01`, `_d3_02` and `_d5_03` — move 0.70 m toward Lake Street and
now stand with their front walls **0.80 m off the block face**, on the line the four roofs of
L141's row already stood on. `tools/generate_block_infill.py` previously refused any setback
below the plat module's 1.5 m `LOT_MARGIN_M`; it now accepts one on the **street line
specifically**, and only where the block recipe names the committed records whose line it
adopts. The number is not authored: `adopts_face_line` lists the records and the generator
measures their front walls, so a recipe stating any other setback fails. The side lot lines keep
the full 1.5 m.
**Why:** T-0104. One block face carried two street lines. L141's row stands 0.80 m off the Lake
face and L144's run stood 1.50 m off it, 10.58 m apart along the face — no wall stepped between
them, which was luck and not design, and the next parcel to close that gap would have put a
0.70 m jog in a street wall this project describes everywhere as one line. The ticket set out
three routes and this is (b): stand closer than the lot margin on the street line, with the
exemption stated as narrowly as L141's party-wall one.
**Why not route (a), which was the obvious one.** Moving L141's four roofs OUT to 1.50 m would
have broken the party wall `recon_1835_south_d3_013` declares with `inf_butcher_market` — a
shared wall that `check_frontage` gates as a shared wall — and so would have created the very
jog the ticket exists to prevent, on the one join in the row where it would be gated as a
defect. Route (a) also rests on a reading the measurement does not support: 1.50 m is a rule
about standing clear of a LOT line, and a party-line row already crosses its own side lot lines
by construction.
**What the measurement found that the ticket did not know.** The face carried worse than two
lines. `inf_bakery_lake` and `inf_butcher_market` — the two inferred-household buildings whose
alignment L141's row cites as its reason for 0.80 m — stand at **0.804 m and 0.784 m**, at
bearing 0 where this face runs at 0.465. They are not on the face's line and they are not
parallel to it; they stand where a hand-authored `center_local_enu_m` in the household programme
put them. So the 0.80 m L141 adopted was a reading of two free-ground placements rather than a
rule, and the 16 mm party wall between `recon_1835_south_d3_013` and `inf_butcher_market` does
not close. That residual is banked BY NAME and BY SIZE in `tools/measure_street_line.py` — it
may shrink and it may not grow — and putting the household layer on the committed face is its
own ticket.
**WHAT IS INVENTED, and it is the same thing it always was.** That any building stood on this
frontage; which buildings; that they stood shoulder to shoulder. **Neither 0.80 m nor 1.50 m is
a measurement of 1835** and no note here claims either is. The only thing chosen is that the
face carries ONE of them, because a street wall is one wall. No roof is added, removed, renamed,
re-familied or re-dimensioned; every id, band and baked mesh is the one it was, the 665-roof
totals do not move, and the meshes do not go stale — a position is not one of the inputs a GLB
is hashed over.
**What now asserts it.** `tools/measure_street_line.py --gate`, in `tools/check.sh`: it takes
the face line out of the committed plat, projects every front wall onto it, and refuses a face
carrying more than one — absolutely, with no ratchet, because the number is now zero. It also
closes party walls from BOTH sides, which is the case neither generator's own frontage gate can
reach when the other half of the wall belongs to another generator.
**How to resolve:** any period document placing a named occupant on a numbered lot on this face
— an advertisement giving an address, a tax or insurance description, an itemised loss list —
would replace an invented roof with a named one and, with it, give the face a line that is a
reading rather than a convention.

### L180 — A landing on the WEST bank at Wolf Point, and no source states a dock anywhere on that shore

**Decision:** Robert A. Kinzie's storehouse at Wolf Point now STATES a dock — `value: true,
confidence: reconstructed, geometry: simplified` — and the wharf layer draws it in the standard
form: a 13.0 m plank deck on a timber crib, its heel tied 2 m into the traced 1834 west bank and
its face 6 m out over the water, abreast the store's own east-facing river wall. It is the FIRST
landing this project has put on the west bank. The wharf rule that selected it is unchanged in
shape — a record whose own `dock` attribute is true — but it is now asked of every river frontage
in the town rather than of South Water Street's merchants only.

**Why:** T-0062 stated five reconstructed docks on the owner's ruling of 2026-08-18, verbatim
*"you can add more docks!"*, and it stated them on South Water merchants. That left the town's
other two shores unasked: the North Division shore carried a landing only because Kinzie &
Hunter's dock happens to be attested, and the west bank at Wolf Point carried none at all. **That
was a fact about which records had been edited, not a finding about Wolf Point** — the west bank
was never measured and refused, it was out of scope by construction. The standing ruling in
AGENTS.md § RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER is that the rationing instinct is the bug; this entry is the
honest cost of removing it on one more shore.

**What bounds the invention:** THE TRADE, and here it is this record's own. chicagology's Wolf
Point narrative gives a storehouse "dealing in groceries and Indian goods"; Andreas's trader list
(scan p. 235) gives "Indian Traders — Robert A. Kinzie, near Wentworth's tavern". The record's
committed position note, written 2026-08-11 and long before any wharf layer existed, already
reasoned from it in as many words — *"a storehouse trading goods off canoes has a positive reason
to face the landing"* — and set the facade due east onto the water on that reading. THE WATER,
measured rather than assumed: the traced 1834 bank runs 11.17 m off the building's river wall, and
a standard-form deck at that foot stands in 1.06 m of water along the whole 13.0 m of its face on
the committed heightfield, with its heel about 0.5 m clear on dry bank; the boat layer
independently floats a schooner in this same reach abreast this store (L146, T-0140), so the bed
this project has already modelled carries a hull here. THE FORM: every dimension of the deck is
the wharf layer's standard one, invented once and claimed at **L132** — this entry claims only the
statement that a landing was there at all, which is exactly what **L145** claims for the five
South Water landings.

**What it does NOT claim.** That any source states a dock, wharf or landing anywhere at Wolf
Point — none does, which is why this is `reconstructed` and not `inferred`. That the trade was
still running on 1835-07-01: the 1833 Treaty of Chicago ceded the land and the removal ran through
the summer of 1835, so the "Indian goods" half of this business was ending as the scene opens, and
the record models a standing store and a standing landing without claiming what crossed either.
And it does not reach the rest of the row: Wentworth's tavern, James Kinzie's residence, the
Robinson and Caldwell cabins and Father Walker's log meeting house state no dock and get none,
because lodging, dwelling and worship take nothing off a canoe — the Temple Building's exclusion
carried across the river.

**What would replace it:** the Chicago Democrat's advertising columns; the harbour engineers'
reports of 1833–1836, which might carry a private wharf line on the branches; or either
retrospective Wolf Point view examined at plate level for works along the west bank. The same
instruments L132 and L145 wait on.

### L178 — Dearborn's worn track leaves the platted line at the corner and swings onto the causeway
**Decision:** Dearborn Street now commits TWO lines instead of one. `path_local_enu_m` is the
platted line and is unchanged — `[[696.4, -400], [699, 18]]`, the analytic extension of the street
module that L79 describes. Beside it sits a new optional field, `drawn_track_local_enu_m`, which is
the worn wheel line the renderer paints: it leaves the platted line where South Water Street crosses
it (local N 7.0) and runs one straight 13.8 m chord to `[697.65, 20.70]`, the south edge of the
Dearborn Street drawbridge's causeway. Nothing else in the project reads the second line — the plat
module, the corridor gate, the lot schedule, the street readout and the flora clearing all still
read the first.

**Why:** the platted line stops 2.70 m short of the boards, on the crest of the approach fill T-0046
graded, and the ribbon stopped exactly where the record did. Measured on the shipped build before the
change: every station up the fill to N 18 landed on drawn roadway and every station past it landed on
none. A visitor climbing from South Water crossed a band of bare crest to reach the bridge — the last
unfinished corner of the owner's own report that started T-0110.

**Why not simply extend the platted line, which is the obvious fix.** Because it was measured and it
fails, twice. `tools/generate_plat_lots.py --check` re-derives every block face by offsetting the
WHOLE street polyline, so a three-metre bend appended to Dearborn's plat reports PLAT GRID DRIFT and
moves platted lot lines the length of the street; and `tools/measure_corridor_intrusion.py --gate`
re-scores the corridors against the same field and goes from the committed 29 laps to 30, the
drawbridge itself newly lapping Dearborn by 0.66 m. Both readings were taken with the bend appended,
before this field existed. **The plat line and the wheel line are different claims and one field was
carrying both.**

**What is invented, exactly.** Two numbers and no more. (1) That the swing is ONE chord: the ribbon's
panels are drawn square to their own chord and are not mitred at their joints, so each turn opens a
wedge of prairie on the outside of it, `3.5 tan(turn/2)` wide at the ribbon's edge and nothing at its
centre. One 5.7-degree joint is the fewest and smallest a swing can be cut into — a 0.61 m² sector,
0.17 m at its widest, inside the 0.84 m across which the road texture's own edge already fades out —
and because that joint stands at the crossing, South Water Street's 10.5 m roadway is drawn over half
of it, leaving **0.30 m² that a 2 cm plan probe finds uncovered by any street**. An eight-chord
easement was measured first and was seven times worse (2.18 m²), because eight joints turn eight
times. (2) That the swing takes 13.8 m, which is to say that it starts at the corner rather than at a
station somebody picked.

**What is NOT invented, and this is the part that bounds it.** The far end is the deck: `[697.65,
20.70]` is the south edge midpoint of the drawbridge's own committed footprint and is also `line[0]`
of the `dearborn_south` approach in `terrain_spec.json`, so the track ends where two existing records
already agree the boards begin. The near end is the platted line itself at the South Water crossing.
And the reason to swing at all is a measurement rather than a preference: held on the platted line the
track's east edge stands 4.87 m off the fill's axis, 0.87 m outside the 4.0 m half-width the earthwork
is level across, so the last stride onto the causeway would be taken on a side slope; swung onto the
axis, every metre of the 7 m width ends on the level crest.

**Consequence:** from South Water the worn track now runs continuously up the fill and butts the deck,
and the drawn ribbon over the last 13.8 m of Dearborn is up to 1.37 m west of the street's platted
centre — a ninth of the 80 ft corridor, and inside it by construction: the compiler refuses a drawn
track that leaves its own platted corridor or overhangs the platted line's ends by more than 4 m. A
visitor reading the street readout, a lot line, a block face or a corridor-intrusion figure is still
reading the platted line and gets exactly the answer they got before. What a visitor cannot do is
treat the last chord as survey geometry; L79 already says that of every travelled strip in this town
and it says it of this one.

**How to resolve:** nothing about 1835 would resolve it — no source states a wheel line. What would
retire the artefact it admits to is mitred ribbon joints in `renderers/web/js/streets.js`, which would
close this wedge and the considerably larger ones South Water Street's own authored bends already
open; that is filed rather than done here, because it moves geometry on every bent street in the town
and this parcel is 2.7 m of Dearborn.

### L111 — Every invented resident is called something else today, and nothing about any of them changed

**Decision:** all **113** reconstructed residents in `data/residents/` were re-drawn from the same
name pools under a new allocation rule, so **113 of 113 invented names changed** across **101
household files** — and with them the household display names, which follow their head's surname.
No person, household, roof, coordinate, grade, source citation or `name_basis` note moved. This
entry exists because a reader who knew this town yesterday will not recognise a single invented
name in it today, and that deserves a stated reason rather than a diff.

**Why:** `tools/generate_inferred_names.py` dealt each community-and-sex pool round **by index**,
so a name was a function of how many people sorted ahead of you and one new household rewrote up
to **73 of 113** names as a side effect — measured across 240 synthetic insertions by the
instrument this parcel commits, against the 17-to-72 range eleven parcels had reported in passing
(ROADMAP **K20**). The rewrite buried each parcel's real additions inside its own noise. The
allocator is now insertion-local — worst case **10**, and **1** in the buckets whose pools have
room — and moving to it is a one-time rename of the whole layer, which K20 said from the start it
would be.

**What is and is not invented here.** The names were already invented and are still invented, to
exactly the same degree and out of exactly the same pools: seeded from the 76 **attested**
residents this project holds, cited on every record, graded `reconstructed`, and carrying the note
that says THE NAME IS INVENTED and that the person is a hypothesis about a count and not anybody.
A different invented name is the same claim about the same nobody, which is why this entry admits a
**change of labels and no new liberty** — nothing here is a fact about Chicago that was not equally
absent before.

**One thing did get better rather than merely different.** The old rule welded each person's given
name to their surname through a shared index; unwelding them let two people draw the same pair, and
the first run of the new rule produced **two Alvah Hastings** — two invented residents who were the
same person. That is now refused outright, and all 113 full names are distinct, which was true by
accident before and is true by assertion now.

**The residual, stated so nobody reads it as a fix that failed.** The surname pools are **2.03×**
oversubscribed in this layer's four large buckets — 36 surnames dealt to 73 men — so a surname is
used two or three times and a newcomer must displace somebody. Widening the pools is evidence work
(more named 1835 Chicagoans out of Andreas and the census rolls), not a tuning knob, and until it
happens the churn floor is the pool's and not the allocator's.

**How to resolve:** nothing here is resolvable by evidence, because nothing here claims anything.
The layer stops being invented one household at a time, as named occupants replace inferred ones —
which is the resolution L83 and L84 already state.

This entry discharges no `Covers:` claim, deliberately. It admits a change of labels, and the
inventions those labels sit on are already covered by **L83** and **L84**.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-16.

### L112 — The rate at which a drawing may grow this census is a convention, and it is one roof per trade per block

**Decision:** method rule 6 of `data/reconstruction/1835_inferred_household_programme.json` gained
a fourth clause on 2026-08-16 (ROADMAP **K28**): a block parcel may adopt **at most one anonymous
roof per trade**, however many of that trade's families the schedule happens to deal it. No
household, roof, coordinate, grade or source citation moved — all **21** block adoptions standing
that day already obeyed it — so this entry admits a **rule** rather than a change to the town.

**Why it is a liberty at all.** Nothing in any source says a Chicago trade acquired one household
per city block, and nothing could: the block is an artefact of **this project's own drawing
order** — the sequence in which ROADMAP's T-A parcels happen to fill the plat — not a unit anybody
in 1835 would recognise. The cap therefore ties the growth rate of an invented layer to an
arbitrary grid. The same two roofs dealt to two blocks would both have been adopted, and under
this clause the same two roofs on one block yield one household. **That asymmetry is invented.**

**Why it was adopted anyway, stated so a reader can disagree with it.** The alternative is no cap,
and then the granularity of the plat sets the rate at which this census grows — a block of eight
dwellings could raise the labourers by three in an afternoon because a schedule that knows nothing
about the census happened to deal three of their families. Rule 6 opens by forbidding exactly
that: the trade mix is a claim about the TOWN and not about what has been drawn. Given a choice
between an arbitrary rate and an arbitrary rate **set by the drawing**, the clause takes the first
and writes it down. It is also the counterweight to the permissive half of the same decision — K28
kept rule 6's tests as two projections of the housing table rather than narrowing them to pairs,
which widens *which* roofs are eligible, and the cap is what bounds *how fast* any of them may
move a count.

**What it costs, named rather than left for a reader to find.** A trade that could honestly have
taken two roofs on one block takes one, and the second household waits for the next block instead
of being refused outright — so the cap **delays** rather than **denies**, and the layer is
slightly smaller at any given moment than an uncapped reading would make it. Nine block parcels
between T-A9 and T-A3h had already applied it by hand and recorded the refusal each time, so this
clause changes the future and not the past.

**How to resolve:** by evidence about the trades rather than about the blocks. The cap exists
because the census's counts are argued from the town's building rate and documented volumes, which
is a loose enough instrument that a drawing could out-run it. A trade whose count is pinned to a
documented figure needs no cap at all, because its ceiling is real; the clause becomes dead letter
for every trade that gets one.

This entry discharges no `Covers:` claim, deliberately. It admits a method convention governing
how many invented households exist, which is the kind of decision the header of this file says
does not live in any single attribute. The inventions the convention paces are already covered by
**L83**, **L84**, **L99**, **L100** and **L101**.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-16.


### L115 — How many flowers a tree carries, which no record states

**Decision:** the number of inflorescences drawn on a woody stem is **invented**, keyed to that
tree's own recorded crown width at 1.6 heads per metre and clamped to 6–26. The record's
`july.inflorescence.size_m` — the size of ONE inflorescence — is used exactly as written, and so
are its colour and its `height_frac`. Only the multiplicity is this project's (ROADMAP
**K45(c)**, `renderers/web/js/trees.js` → `WOODY_HEAD_OF_SHAPE`).

**Why nothing else was possible.** `data/flora/` gives the density of PLANTS per hectare and the
size of one inflorescence, and says nothing anywhere about how many a plant carries. That is the
same gap `flora.js` records in **L35** for the herbaceous layer, and it is a gap in the sources
rather than in the transcription: the dossiers behind these records are a presettlement land
survey and a regional vegetation reconstruction, neither of which counts flowers.

**Why it is not simply L35's number.** `flora.js` keys its count to the plant's architecture and
lands `cluster_terminal` on **1 to 4**, which is right for a forb — the whole plant is one
flowering scape. On a basswood it is wrong by orders of magnitude in the direction that matters,
and the arithmetic is the reason rather than the judgement: the record's own 0.06–0.12 m cluster
at the 23 m slant range of a neighbouring crown (11 m up, 20 m out) subtends 0.0039 rad, which is
**3.3 px** at the renderer's 833 px per radian. The crown carrying it is 10–16 m across, which is
**580 px** at the same range. Four 3-px specks on a 580-px crown is four pixels of noise, and it
would have satisfied every gate this project has while drawing, to a visitor, nothing at all.

**What it costs, named.** A basswood's 13 m crown lands on 21 heads and an ironwood's 5.5 m crown
on 9. A real basswood in full bloom carries very many more than 21 cymes, so this is an
**under**-statement of the bloom and not an over-statement — chosen in that direction because the
alternative is a pale cap over the whole crown, at which point the tree stops reading as a tree in
flower and starts reading as a tree of a different colour. Both ends of the clamp are legibility
decisions, not botany, and they are written as constants (`HEADS_MIN`, `HEADS_MAX`) so a reader
can find them. On the build this was recorded against the whole invention amounts to **187 heads
on 14 stems**, 1,496 of the timber layer's 113,890 triangles, and **no new draw call**.

**What it does NOT invent.** The size, the colour, the height on the plant and whether a head is
drawn at all all come from the record. The July gate is CONTRACT.md §5.4 rule 1 and refuses a head
on a `vegetative` or `budding` record however many the count would allow — the woody layer had no
July gate before this (K44), because `july.phenology` was read by `flora.js` alone.

**And the honest limit, which is not about the count.** The two flowering species are both in the
`mesic_pocket` community, which is **20 of 159 stems**, and every one of the 14 flowering stems
stands north of N +174 m. **The nearest committed scene anchor is 269 m away** — `south_water` —
at which range one inflorescence is **0.28 px**. A visitor who walks north-east will stand under a
flowering basswood; a visitor who stays at any anchor the project itself poses will never see one.
That is a fact about where the mesic pocket falls on the modelled ground, not about this liberty,
and it is written down here so nobody re-derives it from a screenshot.
`tools/measure_head_reach.mjs` re-runs the whole table.

**How to resolve:** by evidence about the flower rather than about the renderer. A count in a
source — a phenological note, a bee-forage estimate, anything that states how many cymes a
mature basswood carries — replaces the constant outright, and the clamp with it.

This entry discharges no `Covers:` claim, deliberately. It admits a **drawing convention** that
governs how many inflorescences appear on a `role: tree` record drawn by
`renderers/web/js/trees.js`, which is the kind of decision the header of this file says does not
live in any single attribute — no record's confidence changes and no attribute is graded by it.

### L117 — Three canopy weights the records do not carry, kept because no record can carry them

**Decision:** three of the twenty-six per-community canopy weights in `renderers/web/js/trees.js`
sit **outside** the density band the zone record their own community cites, and they are kept as
written rather than raised into the band. Since ROADMAP **K46** the written weight is the number
that plants the stem, so each of these three is an ecological claim of this project's own. They
are declared in their community's `departures` field, with the reason, and the renderer refuses to
load an undeclared one.

| entry | written | the band its community's zone records | what the number asserts |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gallery.mix.salix_amygdaloides` | 8 | z05 `[10, 25]` | the peachleaf willow is a bank tree: the gallery's two lists split ZONE 5's single band between them, 17 at the water's edge and 8 behind it |
| `gallery.edgeMix.acer_saccharinum` | 8 | z05 `[15, 35]` | at the water's edge the mix goes to willow — the edge mix's own note, expressed as a weight, over ground ZONE 5 does not band separately |
| `mesic_pocket.mix.ulmus_americana` | 12 | z06 `[40, 80]` | the elm is incidental in the fire-protected pocket, where the closing canopy is basswood, sugar maple and ironwood |

**Why this is the honest form, and it is a fact about the DATASET rather than a preference.** The
obvious repair is to key density by (zone, species) and let each community read the band from the
zone its own `dossier` cites — which is what the file's comment has always claimed it did. It
cannot be done: `wet_woods` cites **ZONE 6a** and `mesic_pocket` cites **ZONE 6b** and both resolve
to the single record **`z06_dense_forest`**, whose elm band is the swamp thicket's reading. A
zone-keyed density gives the elm 60 in both communities, and the 12 that makes it incidental in the
pocket has nowhere in `data/` to live. The sub-community distinction is real, is recorded nowhere
else in this project, and is the whole reason K46 kept the hand weights instead of deleting them.

**Consequence, stated so a reader can weigh it.** All three departures are **downward** — measured
across the twenty-six entries, 23 sit inside their own cited band, 3 fall below one and **none is
above**. So the hand weights have never inflated a species beyond what a record supports; where
they depart, they thin a species the record would have planted more of. Nothing in `data/` moved
and no confidence grade changed: these are render weights, and every species' presence in its
community remains the record's claim rather than this file's.

**How to resolve:** a sub-community band in the dataset — ZONE 6a, 6b and 6c banded apart in
`data/flora/zones/`, and ZONE 5's gallery banded apart from its edge — at which point each of
these three becomes a reading of a record and leaves this entry with `--update` in the same commit.
That is a research parcel, not a renderer one, and the three numbers above are what it has to
account for.

### L119 — Fourteen invented plant footprints, because a cover cannot be counted without one

**Decision:** fourteen of the twenty-five sward records that ROADMAP **K49(c1)** gave a `width_m`
carry a footprint **nothing states and nothing in this dataset implies** — what one drawn plant
covers on the ground — and they are graded `reconstructed` in their own `width_provenance` rather
than left absent. They are: *Persicaria coccinea*, *Lycopus americanus*, *Boehmeria cylindrica*
(sedge meadow); *Allium canadense* (riverbank); *Laportea canadensis*, *Ageratina altissima*,
*Osmorhiza claytonii* (dense forest); and *Poa pratensis*, *Chenopodium album*, *Amaranthus
retroflexus*, *Ambrosia artemisiifolia*, *Xanthium strumarium*, *Rumex crispus*, *Verbena
urticifolia* (the settled town's trampled halo). The other eleven are `inferred`: each is reasoned
from a footprint this dataset already commits for a plant standing beside it in the same list.

**What bounded the invention.** Every one of the fourteen is bounded by its own record's
`height_m` and by the growth habit its dossier row states — a basal rosette is banded under a
branched annual, a shade forb at 0.2–0.6 m tall is given a leaf spread near its own height, a
sod-forming turf grass is given the halo's own height band because it has no clump at all. Not one
is bounded by how the sward looks: no width here was chosen, tried or adjusted against a render.

**Why the gap could not be left open, which is the whole reason this entry exists.** A record's
abundance is one of three fields and they are not three spellings of one number: `stems_per_m2` and
`density_per_ha` count plants, `cover_fraction` measures ground. The sward's placer deals SLOTS and
a slot is one drawn plant, so a cover has to become a count before it can be dealt against a
density, and `width_m` is the only thing in a record that converts it. Twenty-five records carried
a cover and no width, so six of the twenty lists were dealing an area against a count — the dense
forest's understory dealt 96.5 % of its slots that way. Leaving the widths absent was not the
neutral option: it left the arithmetic wrong AND undocumented.

**The honest consequence, stated because it is large.** The footprint is now the number that
decides what a list is made of. In the six mixed lists the shares move by up to a factor of three
on the conversion — June grass 8.1 % → 24.0 % of the sand prairie's matrix, wood nettle 1.1 % →
6.3 % of the forest floor — and for the fourteen above that movement rests on an invented figure.
This is why they carry their own grade instead of the record's: the record's `confidence` grades
what its sources say about the plant, and none of them says this.

**How to resolve:** a measured clump or canopy width for any of the fourteen, from a source this
project can cite, replaces the number and re-grades that record's `width_provenance` with
`--update`-style bookkeeping in the same commit. A dossier sentence that states a SPACING rather
than a width would do it too, and is the better evidence — § ZONE 3's *"tussocks … 0.5–1.0 m
apart"* is one this project already holds for a record it did not need it for.

### L120 — The dune poplars' bole, taper and bark, and a pale trunk chosen so two trees can be told apart

**Decision:** the three trees now standing on the lakeshore — the eastern cottonwood in its dune
form, the quaking aspen and the balsam poplar (ROADMAP **K45(b)** change one) — are drawn with
**bole diameters, fork heights, foliage-mass counts, a lean and three bark colours that no source
states.** The records carry what a record can carry — species, July height, crown width, July
foliage colour, density and confidence, all `attested` off the MNFI open-dune survey and Cowles
1901 — and none of them describes a trunk.

**What bounded each invention.** The dune cottonwood forks at **0.30** of its bole, the lowest in
this file after the open-grown oaks, and leans at **0.30**, the top of the range the file already
uses (its two bank willows sit at 0.24 and 0.30): the record's one visual claim about this tree is
*"isolated, half-buried and leaning, with a sand mound at the base"*, so it takes the most this
project has ever leant anything and no more. Its bark is the gallery cottonwood's own hex, because
it is the same species. The aspen and the balsam poplar take narrow crowns from their own recorded
`width_m` of 3–6 m and bole diameters of 0.10–0.25 m and 0.12–0.28 m — the two thinnest boles in
the file, on the two shortest canopy trees in it.

**The one invention that is a CHOICE rather than a bound, stated as such.** The aspen's bark is
**0xb9bdae**, the palest bole in the scene. Nothing in this dataset states it. It is chosen for two
reasons and both are admitted: a quaking aspen's white-green trunk is the most widely known thing
about the species, and — the reason it is a liberty — **the aspen and the balsam poplar are the
same height, the same crown and the same form**, so without a difference in the wood a visitor
cannot tell that two species are standing there. The balsam poplar keeps an ordinary grey-brown.
The pale tone stays darker than the sycamore's upper limbs (**L118**), which remain the palest
wood in the timber.

**Why this could not be left open.** `SPECIES` says *"one entry per woody species drawn"* and the
loader keys it by species id, so a species recorded by two zones takes the FIRST zone's archetype.
`populus_deltoides` is recorded twice — `z05_riverbank_timber`'s 22–30 m gallery emergent and
`z08_lakeshore`'s 5–15 m half-buried leaner — and with nothing written here the beach would have
been planted with twenty-five-metre floodplain cottonwoods: the record read, routed, banded, and
drawn as another zone's tree. That is **L116**'s fault one level in. Leaving the archetype absent
was not the neutral option.

**Consequence.** Three trees are drawn from parameters this file invented, on ground whose species,
count and density come from the records. Nothing in `data/` moved, no confidence grade changed, and
the substitution `tools/measure_planting_reach.py` banks — a placed species drawn with another
species' bole and bark — is **0** rather than 2, because the archetypes are their own.

**How to resolve:** a measured trunk diameter, bark colour or lean for any of the three, from a
source this project can cite, replaces the invented figure in the same commit that re-banks it. A
photograph of a Lake Michigan open-dune cottonwood in the repository's own reference set would
settle the lean without settling the colour, and would be worth taking on its own.

### L121 — The wood is thinner on a phone by a fraction nothing states, and the ratio is borrowed from the renderer's own triangle ceilings

**Decision:** the scene-detail control now plants a **uniform fraction** of the timber — 100 % at
`full`, **80 %** at `balanced`, **60 %** at `light` (ROADMAP **K45(b3)**). So a visitor on a phone
walks a town with two thirds of the trees a desktop draws, at the same species, in the same
communities, under the same rules about where a stem may stand.

**Nothing states those fractions and nothing could.** They are not a claim about 1835: the wood a
record asks for is `full`'s, which is unchanged to the stem, and the two lower settings are a
rendering decision about a device. The invention is the RATIO, and it is bounded by the only live
per-level statement this renderer makes about how much geometry a level is for — the triangle
ceilings in `main.js`, **1,000,000 / 800,000 / 600,000**, which the release smoke already holds
each level to. 1 / 0.8 / 0.6 is those ceilings read as a ratio and nothing else.

**The alternative that was rejected, and why it is the weaker one.** The pre-K45(b2) stem caps were
820 / 520 / 300, a ratio of 1 / 0.634 / 0.366, and they are the only other per-level numbers this
file has ever carried. They are not used because **they never bound**: measured, the three levels
planted 472, 470 and 437 trees, so those caps are an intent nothing ever executed, and K45(b2) then
multiplied all three by 3.70 for a wider sweep. A number that has never had an effect is not
evidence of what a level should draw.

**What is NOT thinned, and it is the point of the entry.** The sandbar-willow point-bar screen
keeps its stools at every level. A screen needs its clumps to touch, so thinning it does not make a
lighter screen, it makes separate cushions on open sand — which is what the sampling grid had been
doing silently (258 stools at `full`, 190 at `balanced`, **133** at `light`).

**Consequence.** A screenshot taken at `light` is not a screenshot of this reconstruction's wood,
and no figure in this repository is quoted at `light`: every banked measurement, every gate and
every published number is `full`. `tools/measure_timber_detail.mjs --gate` holds that — `full`
keeps 100 % of its stems and every level keeps the north end of the wood.

**How to resolve:** a frame-time measurement on a real phone replaces the borrowed ratio with a
measured one. The instrument for it does not exist here yet; the ceilings are the honest stand-in
until it does, and they are at least a number this renderer already acts on.

### L122 — The shrub archetype: four stems, sixteen leaf sprays, and a branching habit no source describes

**Decision:** the twenty-one records that carry `form: 'shrub_low'` — hazel, elder, buttonbush,
red-osier and grey dogwood, ninebark, winterberry, hawthorn, sumac, wild plum, brambles,
meadowsweet, currant, sand cherry, sand-dune willow, common juniper and the black-oak grubs — are
drawn with **a woody archetype of four stems rising from one root and sixteen leaf sprays over
them** (ROADMAP **K53**). Until today they were drawn with the forb archetype: one herbaceous
stalk, four broad leaves, and a clump width clamped to 0.40 m however wide the record said the
plant was.

**What the records carry and what they do not.** Every dimension the archetype is scaled by is
committed and cited: July height, clump width, the two foliage greens, the July inflorescence and
its colour. **Nothing in this repository states the branching habit of any of them** — how many
stems a Chicago hazel throws, how far they lean, where the leaf mass sits on them. That is the
invention, and it is bounded on both sides by the record: the stems rise to 0.55–0.88 of the
recorded height and lean out to 0.30–0.55 of the recorded half-width, so the plant's **silhouette
is the record's own two numbers** and only the arrangement inside it is invented.

**Why invent it rather than leave the wand.** Three of these records describe multi-stemmed
plants in their own committed text — the black-oak grubs are *"multi-stemmed low clonal oak
sprouting from an old root system"*, the wild plum is *"thicket-forming"*, the sand cherry a *"low
sprawling mat 1–3 m across"* — and a single stalk cannot read as any of the three at any size. So
the choice was not between an invention and the evidence; it was between an invention that is
recorded here and one that was already in the file, unrecorded, and wrong.

**What is NOT claimed.** No species is drawn with a distinguishing habit of its own: a hazel and a
dogwood of the same recorded height and width are the same geometry in two greens, exactly as the
nine flower archetypes share a shape across species. Nothing about which shrub stands where moved
— the drawn census is identical, plant for plant, before and after.

**How to resolve:** a per-species habit — stem count, forking height, leaf size — for the few
species a dossier describes closely enough to carry one. `corylus_americana` is the candidate,
because it is the one the wet-woods dossier singles out.

### L123 — The wet woods' shrub layer is drawn at two fifths of the cover its records claim, because a lattice slot carries one plant

**Decision:** the shrub stratum is dealt from **its own lattice pass**, at its own recorded clump
density, independently of the herb layer it stands over (ROADMAP **K54**). That pass inherits the
forb lattice's one plant per slot — 2.89 m² of ground — so a community whose records ask for more
clumps than that ceiling allows is drawn at the ceiling. **Measured, `z06_dense_forest` is the one
community of ten where it binds:** nine `shrub_low` records there sum to **94.9 %** ground cover
and the drawn layer reaches **40.1 %** of it. Every other community is drawn at its recorded
density — the riverbank timber's dogwood belt reads **20.1 % drawn against 19.5 % recorded**.

**What is NOT invented.** No share, no cap and no tuning number was authored for this. The slot
density is the forb layer's own (L32), the clump density is the record's own `cover_fraction`
divided by what one clump covers, and the ceiling is the lattice's existing `min(1, …)` — the same
clamp the herb layer has always had, which the wet woods' herb records also reach. The invention
is only that the shortfall is ACCEPTED rather than paid for with a denser lattice.

**Why accept it.** The wet woods' own records describe a nearly closed shrub canopy, and the
honest alternatives both cost more than they buy: a finer lattice for one community spends the
geometry budget on the community a visitor can see least far into, and a second clump per slot
would draw plants inside each other. A layer at two fifths of a closed canopy still reads as a
thicket; at 1 % — which is what it was, 2 plants of 158 — it read as a wood with no shrubs in it.

**Consequence, stated plainly:** a shrub count taken in `z06_dense_forest` is a floor, not the
record's figure, and `tools/measure_sward_draw.mjs` prints drawn cover against recorded cover in
every community so the gap is visible wherever it is quoted.

**How to resolve:** a per-community lattice cell, sized off that community's own summed clump
density rather than the forb layer's. It needs a frame-time measurement in the wet woods first,
because the wet woods is also where the matrix layer is densest.

ceiling comes from), and ROADMAP **K54**.

### L124 — A shrub's leaf spray is a mass of leaves, not a leaf, and thirty-two of them is what closes the shell

**Decision:** each of the shrub archetype's leaf sprays (**L122**) stands for **a season's leaves
on one shoot** — a mass, not a single leaf — and there are now **thirty-two** of them where there
were sixteen (ROADMAP **K56**). Their size is unchanged: 0.26–0.42 of the recorded clump radius,
which on a hazel recorded 2.25 m across is a spray 0.26–0.44 m long.

**Why the size is the wrong number to have moved.** K56 was opened on the observation that a
0.4 m spray is nowhere near the ~10 cm of an actual hazel leaf, and asked what the spray STANDS
FOR before any number changed. It stands for a leaf mass, on the same footing as the tree canopy's
plates and the near tuft's bundle of shoots in this renderer — none of those is one leaf either,
and two triangles cannot carry one at any size. **So shrinking the spray would not have bought a
leaf; it would have bought a smaller plate with more sky around it.**

**What the looking found instead, and it is the count.** Summed over the archetype's own loop, the
sixteen sprays' plates cover **17.7 %** of the shell they are spread over. That is a clump a
visitor sees straight through — `docs/evidence/k56-before.png`, 158 of them in one ring — and an
isolated plate with sky on both sides reads as one enormous leaf precisely BECAUSE nothing overlaps
it. Thirty-two cover **30.9 %** and overlap: `docs/evidence/k56-after.png`, the same station.

**The second invention here, stated separately because it is a habit and not a count.** The lowest
of the three spray bands **arches downward** over the stems. Nothing in the first cut hung below its
own attachment, so the shell stayed open exactly where the four stems are most exposed, and those
stems are drawn dark on purpose (this module's only occlusion term) — so an open lower shell reads
as black sticks. A drooping outer shoot is bounded on the other side instead: it may fall at most
half way back to the ground from its attachment, so no tip is pushed below the plant's own base.

**What is NOT claimed.** No source in this repository states the leaf-mass count, the band heights
or the droop for any of the twenty-one `shrub_low` records — this is the same invention L122
recorded, at a finer grain, and it remains bounded by the record's own two numbers: the drawn
silhouette still reaches 0.98 of the recorded half-width and no tip leaves the recorded height. No
species gets a habit of its own, nothing about which shrub stands where moved, and no count of
plants changed — `tools/measure_sward_draw.mjs` reads back the same census, plant for plant.

**Cost, since it is a triangle count and not free:** 40 triangles per shrub becomes 72, which in
the wet woods' ring is +5,056 of a 1,000,000 ceiling.

**How to resolve:** a finer grain — more, smaller sprays at the same total plate area — is a real
question this parcel did not answer, because it trades triangles against grain and needs a budget
rather than a preference. ROADMAP **K57** carries it.

### L125 — Forty-eight leaf sprays, because refining the grain would have spent the recorded clump width on coverage

**Decision:** the shrub archetype (**L122**, **L124**) now carries **forty-eight** leaf sprays where
it carried thirty-two, and **the size of a spray is unchanged again** — 0.26–0.42 of the recorded
clump radius, a 0.26–0.44 m mass on a hazel recorded 2.25 m across. ROADMAP **K57**.

**The question K57 was written to answer, and why it could not be answered as asked.** L124 left it
open: *at the same total plate area, is the shell better read as 32 masses of 0.4 m or 64 of 0.2 m?*
Holding the total plate area is exactly what cannot be done here. The plates are what carries the
clump's **recorded half-width** — the one horizontal number the research owns — so paying for a
finer grain out of the plate size pulls the whole bush in. Measured over 24 bearings by
`tools/measure_spray_grain.mjs`: 64 sprays at the shipped total area take the drawn reach from
**0.990 of the recorded half-width to 0.890**, and the spray from 37 cm to 26 cm. It buys coverage
— 36.9 % of the outline to 45.4 % — with a number that is not the renderer's to spend.

**So the grain trades against triangles, and the invention is the count, again.** At the shipped
plate size the count alone gives 32 → 48 → 64 sprays a foliage coverage of **36.9 % → 46.9 % →
51.3 %**, for 72 → 104 → 136 triangles, with the reach unmoved at 0.990–0.998. Ten of the fourteen
available points arrive with the first thirty-two triangles and four with the second, so **48 is
where the return halves and 48 is what ships.** The remaining 4.4 points are measured and left
unspent rather than taken quietly.

**What is NOT claimed.** No source in this repository states a leaf-mass count for any of the
twenty-one `shrub_low` records, and none is invented here that L122 and L124 did not already
record — this is the same invention at a coarser dial. What is not invented: the silhouette, which
still reaches **0.998** of the recorded half-width and never leaves the recorded height, and the
census, which is identical plant for plant. Nothing about which shrub stands where moved.

**And the bound is now a gate rather than a paragraph.** `tools/measure_spray_grain.mjs --gate` runs
in `tools/check.sh` and asserts the two numbers the research owns — reach ≥ 0.95 of the recorded
half-width, and a spray at least twice a 10 cm leaf so the mass abstraction cannot quietly become a
claim to draw a leaf — plus a ratchet holding the coverage above 40 % at every bearing. L124's own
figures were taken by a script that was never committed and cannot be reproduced; this one is the
module the scene draws.

**Cost:** 72 triangles per shrub becomes 104, which in the wet woods' ring of 167 is 17,368 of a
1,000,000 ceiling — 1.7 %.

### L126 — Every building in the town is tinted by a rule, and only two are exempt

**Decision:** every structure's baked surfaces are multiplied by a per-building **facade tone**
computed in `renderers/web/js/facades.js` — a silvering that grows with the record's own age, and a
value/warmth jitter dealt from a hash of the record's id. It is **reconstructed**: no source this
repository holds states the colour of any wall in 1835 Chicago, and the dataset agrees with itself
about that — `paint` is `reconstructed` on 236 of 335 records, `inferred` on 15 and **`attested` on
exactly two**. Those two — the Sauganash's documented white and St Mary's attested unpainted — are
handed the identity tone and are drawn at the colour their archetype baked, to the bit, with the
tone on or off. T-0002; the owner's ask was that the buildings "read as freshly painted and
identical".

**The bounds, which are the whole of the invention.** Silvering mixes a surface at most **0.35** of
the way toward its own luminance and darkens it at most **0.10**, reached at **12 years** of
exposure; a whitewashed wall silvers at half that rate because lime was renewed, and a masonry one
(`brick`, `stone`, `earth`) does not silver at all. The jitter is **±16 %** of value and **±7 %**
of warmth, halved on masonry — inside the ~30 % of value the archetypes already put between an
unpainted wall (`0.52, 0.44, 0.34`) and an outbuilding's board (`0.335, 0.310, 0.268`), so no
building is tinted to a shade the generators could not have baked outright. Nothing here is derived from a source, because no source states one;
the ceilings are set so the oldest building in the town — the fort's, at 19 years — reads as grey
and dirty beside a new one without leaving the range of colours the archetypes themselves bake.
`docs/research/04-structures-south.md` reads the fort in 1835 as "serviceable, weathered,
whitewashed/unpainted log-and-brick" `[INF]`, which is the nearest thing to a statement about
surface condition this repository holds, and it is a direction rather than a number.

**What the age input is, and what it is NOT.** The silvering reads `documented_range.from`, which
for the well-attested buildings is a construction date — 1816 for the fort's, 1833 for the Green
Tree. **For the 262 anonymous infill records it is a scene-programme date, not a construction
date**, so those buildings compute an age near zero and are drawn essentially unsilvered. That is
the absence of a claim, not a claim that they are new, and it is why the jitter and not the age is
what makes most of the town differ from itself. Inventing ages for them would be a second
reconstruction stacked on this one, and it is not needed.

**What is measured rather than asserted.** `tools/measure_facade_variety.mjs` reads the colours back
off the batch the renderer draws: **331 distinct facade tones across 331 structures**; of 321
nearest-neighbour pairs within 60 m, **10 were drawn identically to the bit before this and none
are now**; neighbours differ by a median **10.4 %** in applied value, on every surface they own.
Winding the tone off moves the worst 48² frame cell by **10** and restores to a residual of **0**. Four assertions in `tools/smoke_renderer.mjs` hold all of it, including the
inertness one on the attested pair.

**What is NOT claimed.** No board is a different WIDTH from any other, no lap rhythm changed and no
building gained a texture: this is a tint on the surfaces the bake already produced, and the
irregularity half of T-0002 is geometry that needs the nightly bake. The tone is per STRUCTURE, so
a building's roof, walls, trim and stack all move together — a wall is not weathered independently
of the roof above it, which no source would support either.

**What the frames say, and it is not all good news.** Photographed at `lake_market` and
`from_above` with the tone on and off, the first pair is hard to tell apart — because the
`lake_market` station stands in front of the **Sauganash**, which is one of the two records this
rule is forbidden to touch, and the town it varies is behind it. The variation is plain from the
air and along a street of small houses, and it is slight where one exempt building fills the
frame. That is why the jitter was raised from ±10 % before this shipped, and it is why the
acceptance clause is quoted with its station rather than declared discharged in general.

**Cost:** none in draw calls. The tone folds into the per-vertex colour the batch already carries
(**R-W5a**), so the untextured town is still one batch and one shadow-pass call.

**AMENDED 2026-08-22 (T-0047) — the deal now knows where the buildings stand, and the bound did not
move.** The jitter above is dealt from a hash of the record's identity, which is deterministic,
cheap and blind to the neighbourhood. A blind deal has a tail, and T-0048's own instrument found
it: over 329 nearest-neighbour pairs inside 60 m the median pair differed by **10.3 %** of applied
value and the tenth percentile by **2.4 %**, which is at or under what a visitor reads between two
walls in the same light. About a tenth of the pairs a visitor walks past were two houses wearing
one paint.

**The fix is a choice inside the bound, not a wider bound.** Every building is offered **32**
candidate deals drawn from the identical interval this entry already fences — the same
`jitterValue`, the same halved spread on masonry — and takes the one that stands furthest clear of
the neighbours already dealt, under a floor of 0.14 of applied value for two buildings on the same
spot falling linearly to nothing at 60 m. **No wall can reach a shade it could not reach before**,
because the candidates are drawn from the same interval; what changed is which of them a building
takes. 158 of 339 structures take a different deal; the other 181 keep the exact tone they had,
because candidate 0 is the plain `id|phase` hash this entry has always described and a building
with nothing inside 60 m never enters the pass.

**Measured on the same instrument, published mirror, 1280x800:** the tenth percentile goes
**2.4 % → 7.7 %** and the median **10.3 % → 13.3 %**, so the tail reaches **0.58** of the middle
where it reached 0.23. The two attested records are untouched and still bit-exact — they are not
eligible, so they never enter the pass — and the deal is still deterministic to the id: two loads
of one scene give one town.

**The alternative that was rejected, measured rather than argued.** A two-sided cost — one that
also pulled a well-separated pair back toward the target — collapses the town rather than evening
it: the median pair fell to **4.9 %** and the ratio to **0.31**. Repulsion only pushes, and that is
why it is the right shape here.

Related: **L22** (wall surfaces are the archetype's, not the record's — this is that finding tinted
rather than resolved), **L120** (a pale trunk chosen so two trees can be told apart, the same
invention in the flora), and tickets **T-0048** (this half), **T-0047** (the repulsion amendment
above) and **T-0049** (the board half, which needs the bake).
**Recorded:** 2026-08-17. **Amended:** 2026-08-22.

### L127 — The Western Hotel's wagon yard: an attested yard, and a fence nobody described
**Decision:** the yard behind the Western Hotel is drawn as a **post-and-rail fence, 1.37 m high,
three rail courses, posts at 2.9 m**, enclosing the ground between the hotel and its stable and
reaching both street frontages, with a **4.27 m gateway on Canal and another on Randolph**. It is
drawn by `renderers/web/js/enclosures.js` from `data/enclosures/western_hotel_wagon_yard.json` —
the first record in this project that carries a perimeter instead of a footprint.
**Why:** what a source states is one clause. *"In the rear was the large stable and the yard into
which the trains were driven. There were entrances to the yard from both streets."* That is a
yard, in a stated place, with two stated gateways, and it is the whole of the evidence. Everything
else in the paragraph above is invented — and the alternative was the ten days this entry has
already spent as **L10**, where the yard that *was* the west-side teamsters' house as a visitor
experienced it was left out of the model entirely because the only archetype that would take it
built a building.
**What bounds the invention, since that is what `reconstructed` means here.** The OUTLINE is
mostly derived rather than chosen: the west line is the hotel's own west wall continued south, the
south line is the stable's north face, the north line is the hotel's south wall, and each of those
is a committed coordinate in `data/sidecars/1835/`. The one free coordinate is the east line, and
it is set by the Randolph gateway rather than picked — the hotel stands on the corner, so a yard
"in the rear" can only reach Randolph by a neck past the hotel's east gable, and a 14-ft gateway
with a post either side does not fit in less. The FENCE is invented outright: post-and-rail over
a worm fence (which needs three metres of ground either side and would not fit between a hotel and
its stable) and over close boarding (which would make the yard a room, where the source's picture
is of teams driven in off the street); 4 ft 6 in because a yard fence turns a team and does not
have to hold a horse that means to leave — that is the pound's job, and the pound is on the public
square; three courses because that is what fills 4 ft 6 in; 2.9 m because that is the span a sawn
rail carries. Not one of those numbers is attested and the record says so on every one of them.
**Consequence:** a visitor standing behind the Western Hotel sees a specific fence, and no source
describes any fence there. The confidence view is the honest counterweight and it is wired: every
vertex of this layer is graded `reconstructed`, so hiding that level removes the whole fence and
leaves the yard as the sources leave it — an open piece of ground between two buildings. **The
ground inside the fence is not drawn.** A yard that wagon trains entered daily was not prairie
sward, and it is still prairie sward here, because nothing states whether it was worn earth,
gravel, plank or mud and a wear pattern is not something this record can bound. That is the
larger of the two admissions and it is deliberately left standing rather than guessed.
**How to resolve:** a Chicago or Cook County fence ordinance of the 1830s would settle the height
and the courses in one line — a lawful-fence specification is exactly the kind of thing such an
order carries; an insurance or tax description of the lot would settle the rest.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-18.

### L144 — Three roofs on one lot at Lake and Clark, and the corner they are built to
**Decision:** the Lake-and-Clark corner lot of `blk_lake_clark` — lot 0 of the committed plat
grid, the last free lot on this block's business face — carries **three anonymous roofs standing
shoulder to shoulder on the Lake Street frontage**, not one cottage set back in the middle of it:
a log dwelling on the corner itself, a one-room frame cottage next to it and a deep-plan frame
cottage closing the run at the east end, on one line, at one 1.5 m setback, on two shared party
walls. A privy stands in the same lot's yard at the alley end. The run occupies 16.86 m of the
lot's 21.75 m of buildable frontage and its west wall stands 1.50 m from the Clark side line,
which is the closest line the plat module's own lot margin allows.
**Why:** T-0079, the third and last piece of the owner's flagged-important ask of 2026-08-18 —
*"there should be more and denser buildings. this is important."* His reference for this corner
is the Tremont House street scene (`data/sources/assets/owner_brief_2026_08_18/README.md`, image
5), a continuous storefront row on shared party lines, beside a screenshot of the same corner in
the render standing on grass. Until this parcel the schedule could not answer it here: a block's
ceiling was one principal roof per platted lot, and a party-line run carried exactly one roof per
lot it was dealt, so this block's single free Lake lot could take exactly one detached cottage.
**THE CEILING THAT MOVED, AND WHAT BOUGHT IT.** The rule is now three units per lot, and the
number is measured rather than chosen: the smallest lot on the committed grid has 23.56 m of
frontage, the plat module keeps 1.5 m clear of a side line at each end of a run, and the eighteen
party-line units already committed average 6.072 m wide — so (23.56 − 3.00) / 6.072 = 3.39 units
fit on the meanest lot in the town and the fourth does not. The old rule was also being counted in
the wrong unit: the side lot lines are conjectural, and every record this generator writes says so
in its own position note, while the block FACE is committed geometry derived from the street
centrelines. **The 665-roof total does not move.** The four roofs come out of
`south_plat_beyond_committed_control`, the district balance waiting on street control past State
and Washington, which fell from 175 roofs to 120 when the ceiling rose.
**WHAT IS INVENTED.** That any building stood on this ground at all; that there were three of
them; that they stood shoulder to shoulder rather than apart; that the corner one was of logs.
The reference supports the TREATMENT — a built-up corner and a party-line frontage on this street
at about this date — and cannot say which buildings. Every dimension is sampled inside the family
band the reconstruction spec authors, exactly as every other anonymous roof's is, and every value
on all four records grades `reconstructed` with its own note saying so. **No coordinate is
authored:** the line, its bearing and the end the run packs away from are read from the committed
block boundary in `data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json`.
**A second street line on one face, and it is not hidden.** T-0077's row on this same Lake face
stands 0.80 m off the face line; this generator's floor is the plat module's 1.5 m lot margin, so
the two runs sit 0.70 m apart in setback. They are 10.58 m apart along the face and no wall steps
between them, but one face carrying two street lines is a defect rather than a design, and it is
filed as its own ticket rather than normalised away inside this parcel. **CLOSED by L177 (T-0104):** this run's
three roofs moved 0.70 m out onto T-0077's line, so the face carries one street line and
`tools/measure_street_line.py` now asserts that of every block face in the town.
**A log dwelling on a business frontage is an open question, and it was answered by the reference
rather than by the schedule.** T-0022 asks whether the schedule may deal log cabins to commercial
frontage and is unresolved. What decided it here is that the owner's other reference for a
party-line row — *"South Water Street in 1834"* — draws the row as *log and frame buildings
shoulder to shoulder*, so a log unit in a row is the thing the picture shows rather than an
awkward deal. The question stays open for the schedule; this parcel is one instance, recorded.
**How to resolve:** any period document placing a named occupant on a numbered lot at the corner
of Lake and Clark — an advertisement giving an address, a tax or insurance description, an
itemised loss list — would replace an invented roof with a named one on the same line, which is
what the 665-roof programme's substitution clause exists for.

### L149 — Terrain: the State Street slough is built on a documented route with an invented line, width and depth profile
**Decision:** dossier zone 14 — the South Division's natural drain, from the public square's
east side to the river at the foot of State Street — is carved into the ground as two swale
entries (`state_slough_course`, `state_slough_mouth` in `terrain_spec.json`), both
`reconstructed`. The course is cut 2.2 ft on a 5 m half-width, FEATHERING from zero at its
head over the first ~58 m so the ground closes over the drain's rise instead of ending in an
open trench; the mouth reach grades from the course's 2.2 ft to a full 6.2 ft against the
State ridge toe on a 3 m half-width, runs straight north under the committed Slough Log
Bridge deck, and enters the river SQUARE at about E +809.5, N +25 — one reach, one pool from
about N −25 to the water (amended by T-0118; as first built the mouth turned east and ran
~35 m along the shore to the traced re-entrant at 6.2 ft, and the owner read the resulting
shore-parallel pocket as a bay).
**Why:** the ROUTE is documented (chicagology_prefire273: it "passed over the site of the
Tremont House and entered the river at the end of State Street") and the waypoints between its
documented ends are read from Conley/Stelzer 1933 under that source's `orientation` ceiling —
head just east of Clark between Washington and Randolph, a mid-block Dearborn crossing about
N −190. The DEPTH figure restates the dossier row's own thalweg (1.5–3.0 ft below the adjacent
plain, about +0.5…+1.5 ft absolute — the reason this is a swale and not a below-datum channel),
and the WIDTH sits at the top of the row's 15–40 ft band. What is invented outright: the exact
line between the documented waypoints, chosen to thread the committed reconstructed roofs; the
head feather's length (the head vertex itself does not move, and the visible hollow dies out
inside the head reading's own 20–30 m tolerance); the mouth reach's 6.2 ft cut, sized against
the State ridge toe the spec already builds; and THE CHOICE OF WHICH PIN THE STRAIGHT ENTRY
KEEPS. A single straight reach cannot honour both the committed bridge deck (E +805…+813) and
Wright's traced re-entrant (E +850…+856), and it is the TRACED RE-ENTRANT the carved mouth no
longer ends inside: the bridge is a committed structure with committed approach earthworks,
moving it east into the rising ridge toe would demand street cuts twice as deep, and the
documentary mouth — the foot of State, about E +827 at the bank — sits BETWEEN the pins, with
the built mouth ~18 m west of it (inside the sheet's ±20 m band) where the traced notch was
~25 m east. The re-entrant itself stays exactly as traced in the waterline — a small drawn
notch 40 m east of the built mouth, evidence kept, no longer claimed as this drain's outfall.
The old over-deepened joint (−5.0 ft where the two entries' cuts summed) is GONE: swale cuts
now combine by maximum and the mouth's depth profile opens at the course's own 2.2 ft, so the
two entries carve one continuous graded bed.
**Consequence:** a visitor sees the drain the town bridged — a winding damp hollow through the
business district falling into standing water below the ridge toe — and the State slough
empties straight into the river in one reach, with no shore-parallel pocket. Every carved cell
is conjectural in the confidence channel and dithers when `reconstructed` is hidden. The
streets the drain crosses (Dearborn, Lake) dip through it at grade; no crossing is documented
at either, and none is built.
**How to resolve:** any grading petition, drainage ordinance, lot survey or levelled section
locating or sounding the slough — a sourced line or depth would replace the invented one for
one; a sourced mouth position would settle which pin the straight entry should have kept; see
docs/RESEARCH/main_branch_sloughs_1833.md.

### L150 — Terrain: the La Salle slough's inland course and terminus rest on a 1933 reconstruction
**Decision:** the watercourse Wright 1834 draws dropping south off the main stem just east of
La Salle Street is carried inland as two swale entries (`lasalle_slough_lower`,
`lasalle_slough_upper` in `terrain_spec.json`), both `reconstructed`: a wet lower reach
(3.2 ft cut, standing backwater to about N −95, short of the Lake Street corridor, which
stays dry) grading WITHOUT A STEP into a dry upper swale (1.8 ft through its middle reaches)
that terminates just north of Randolph Street, the cut feathering to zero over its last
~40 m so the ground closes over the head. The invented alignment MEANDERS — swings of 7–10 m
about its drift, crossing the ground at an angle — instead of ruling the straight N–S line
first built (amended by T-0118: the owner, against an 1830s engraving, read the ruled line as
wrong for a prairie drain, and read the 3.2→1.8 ft step at the entries' join — where water
is drawn only below datum — as a dry sill of land sitting across a continuous watercourse).
**Why:** the mouth and the stream's existence are Wright's, drawn on the sheet this terrain is
fitted to, and carrying the channel further south than Wright washes it was refused when the
mouth was traced ("inventing a bank where the draughtsman stopped"). This entry is the
research thread that refusal left open, done in the form it prescribed: a centreline argued
from Conley/Stelzer — which draws the course up the west half of the La Salle–Clark block,
water-washed to about Lake Street and a dark drain beyond, ending just north of Randolph —
never a traced boundary. The terminus is a position from a 1933 pictorial reconstruction at
`orientation` ceiling, read at 20–30 m tolerance; the width (8 m overall, inside the
north-side slough's measured 7.1 m band), both depths, the meander's exact swings (bent
between the fixed readings, threading the committed roofs — old_bank_building cleared by
2.4 m at the nearest pass) and the depth grading are invented outright, and the channel
starts one cell south of the South Water corridor because Wright draws the stream stopping
at the street line — the street's crossing (fill or culvert) is attested by that drawing and
described by nothing. THE SILL WAS RESOLVED BY GRADING, NOT BY DEEPENING: the dossier's own
thalweg for these inland courses sits ABOVE datum ("wet mouths, damp inland courses" was
chosen deliberately), so the join was not cut below water; the depth profile instead shallows
the bed continuously from the wet reach (−0.5 m at the mouth) up through the join (+0.15 m)
and on, so the water simply ENDS at a tapering edge like a pond's, with no wall of land
across the channel. The water's edge pulls back from about N −105 to about N −95 in the
bargain — still "open water to about Lake Street" within the source's own read tolerance,
and the platted corridor now stays dry with margin rather than by luck.
**Consequence:** the second of the three Main Branch sloughs reads as ONE continuous
watercourse from the traced mouth to a feathered head; its whole inland geometry says
`conjectural` in the confidence channel while its mouth remains the traced, documented
re-entrant. If Conley erred — he demonstrably errs elsewhere — the inland course is his error
carried at the grade that admits it.
**How to resolve:** any period document locating the stream — a lot survey, a grading record,
a bridge or culvert order for South Water Street west of Clark; see
docs/RESEARCH/main_branch_sloughs_1833.md.

### L151 — Dooryard trees and bushes at 61 houses, every stem of them dealt
**Decision:** `data/flora/plantings/town_dooryard_plantings.json` states 66 dooryard trees
(American elm, eastern cottonwood) and 59 currant clumps around 61 of the town's 134
dwellings, every coordinate, count and height `reconstructed`, dealt by the seeded rule in
`tools/generate_dooryard_plantings.py` and re-derived byte for byte on every commit. A
dooryard shrub is drawn with its own three-puff clump archetype in
`renderers/web/js/trees.js`, whose spec (bark colour, stick and puff counts and sizes) is
invented within that file's own range like every number in its SPECIES table, and whose
draw path carries no head — so the currants' recorded July berry cluster is not drawn,
and the record says so.
**Why:** the owner asked for it in as many words (ticket T-0074), and image 12 of the
2026-08-18 brief states the treatment generally: trees and bushes stand close around the
houses, kept deliberately. No source counts, places or names any particular house's stems,
so the honest shape is the garden-picket precedent (L129): a rule that can say of every
stem on what basis that house got it, rather than 125 numbers someone typed. The species
are the settled town's own (`z10_settled_town`: relict elm and cottonwood, dooryard
currants), so nothing new is claimed to have grown here; whether a given tree was kept
from the clearing or planted by the household is unknowable and deliberately unclaimed,
since the timber belt's documented east end means most house lots had nothing to keep.
**Consequence:** houses across the town read as lived-around rather than parked on open
prairie — which is the plate's whole lesson — at the cost that every stem is an invention.
The confidence channel says so: every stem carries `reconstructed`, and the dense
party-wall blocks got nothing because no allowed ground exists inside them (the record's
`refused` list names each one).
**How to resolve:** T-0075's source records for the plates; any sale notice, diary, view
or photograph-era survivor count that places a particular house's trees; a source
describing the Lombardy poplars' spread into the town would additionally unlock the
species this deal deliberately omits.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-20.

### L153 — The river plank walk: a footway over the slough mouth and a bank walk to Jones's landing, every knot invented between committed pins
**Decision:** `data/frontage/river_walk_frontage.json` lays a plank footway over the State
Street slough's mouth along the Slough Log Bridge's committed deck, and a riverside plank
walk that carries on from it westward along the south bank of the main stem — about 439 m
of walk in all, every run `reconstructed`, generated by `tools/generate_frontage_works.py`
with the same drawn treatment as the town's other walks (6 ft wide, 0.11 m rise, 55 mm
boards at a 0.26 m pitch) and re-derived byte for byte on every commit. WHAT BOUNDED THE
RUN, pin by pin: the crossing footway's extent is the bridge's committed deck ends
(E +805.3…+813.3) plus 1.7 m onto each graded approach, and its boards ride the deck
surface the bridge sidecar already states (`walk_surface_m` 0.83 over a water anchor) —
the same number the walker's deck registry reads, so the plank a visitor stands on over
the water and the plank the mesh draws are one figure; the walk's line west of the
crossing threads the verge between the South Water track's committed edge and the traced
1834 bank, crossing Dearborn's drawbridge approach on a board crossing set square on that
street's committed centreline; the run BREAKS at the La Salle slough's traced mouth,
where the bank itself is interrupted and no crossing is committed — the street record's
own reading is that South Water "crossed on fill or a culvert nothing describes", so the
street fill carries the foot passenger and no board is laid over that water; and it ENDS
at Jones's landing, the easternmost committed wharf on the South Water bank, where the
town's riverfront walking surface begins. Everything between those pins — every knot of
the three reaches — is invented, and audited on every regeneration: each board station
must stand on committed ground above the water and clear the travelled track, the run
must end within a landing's width of Jones's committed bank foot, and the one gap must
still be wet, or the generator refuses to write the record.
**Why:** the owner, standing at the slough mouth on 2026-08-20 (ticket T-0119): *"the
pedestrian plank sidewalk bridge crossing it close to the river should exist and run
along the river towards the town"* — under the standing 2026-08-18 ruling that
reconstructed items may be added liberally so long as they are labelled and marked. The
crossing itself is documented (the bridge record: a log bridge was needed where Water
Street crossed the slough, until after 1840); that people walked it, and walked the bank
into town, is the sort of thing a working riverfront implies and no source states. The
walk reuses T-0082/T-0090's frontage machinery rather than inventing a second kind of
plank, and T-0045's deck-walking machinery is what makes the footway a surface a visitor
stands on over the water.
**Consequence:** from the owner's stand a plank footway crosses the slough at the bridge
and continues along the river bank towards town, walkable end to end — on the planks over
the water at the mouth, on the heightfield everywhere else. Aiming at any of it opens the
walk's own card, which says it is reconstructed and what bounded it. Every vertex carries
`reconstructed` in the confidence channel, so hiding that tier removes the whole walk.
The walk publishes its floor to the planting block-list, so nothing roots through it.
**How to resolve:** a Chicago town order on sidewalks of the right date; a grading or
wharfing order for Water Street east of Dearborn; any view of the slough mouth or the
South Water bank showing the crossing's walking surface or a bank walk; a committed
crossing at the La Salle mouth would close the one gap in the run.
**Recorded:** 2026-08-21.
**Amended 2026-09-03 — this walk is held between STRING PIECES (T-0460).** The one renderer that draws every plank walk in this project now lays a 0.09 m edge timber down each side of one, its top flush with the boards and its foot in the ground, taking the outermost 0.09 m of the walk's own width so nothing widens. It replaces a row of board ENDS at the walk's edge, which is what the owner reported as a jagged sawtooth where the boards met the dirt. **The invention this adds — that these walks had edge timbers at all — is argued in full at L160**, and it is the same class as the width, the rise and the plank pitch this entry already claims.

### L155 — Terrain: the fort's river frontage is cut steeper than the banks either side of it
**Decision:** the south division's `face_profile` in
`data/terrain/epochs/e1834_harbor_cut/terrain_spec.json` is narrowed from the reach's 20 m
to **8 m across E 1103–1180**, the stockade's river frontage, with shoulders at 1085 and
1215 holding the neighbouring bank unchanged. Nothing about the mound itself moves: its
centre, its 45 m flat top, its 75 m outer radius and its +3.8 ft rise to the dossier zone's
own +12 ft apex are all as v202 left them, and `picket_height_m` stays 3.7 m. What changes
is the WIDTH OF THE BANK FACE at the fort, and with it the ground under the fort's north
wall — from 1.26 m to 2.57 m — so the stockade's mesh, which anchors at the lowest
ground beneath it, no longer sinks two and a half metres into its own footprint.
**Why:** the fort had to stand on its mound, and as built it did not. The bank ramp
multiplies every land level by `1 − (1 − d/face)²` — zero at the waterline, full only at
`face` metres inland — and the traced 1834 waterline runs **4.5 m** north of the stockade's
north-west corner and **7 m** north of its north-east. A 20 m face simply does not fit
between the fort and the river, so the ramp reached some 15 m inside the walls and scaled
the north wall's ground to a third of its height; from the parade only 1.41 m of a 3.80 m
wall showed, under a 1.68 m eye. That is the fault the owner reported on 2026-08-19 and
ruled on for this ticket on 2026-08-21 ("regrade the mound under the wall line"), and it is
also flatly contrary to what the source says the landform is: the mound is "formed by the
curve of the river at its base on its three sides" — the river at the mound's BASE, not
partway up the fort's wall. The mound's own note claimed a north face of "+12 ft over about
a 25 m run"; there is no 25 m run at the fort's corners, and that sentence is corrected in
the same commit rather than left standing.
**What is invented:** the 8 m figure and the two shoulder positions. No source states the
width or the angle of the fort's river face. The number is not free, though: it is the
FLATTEST face that fits the measured 4.5 m gap while holding the mound's level to the wall
line, and it carries the fort's 2.57 m of bank to the waterline over about 4.3 m — **1:1.7**, or 31°,
measured on the rebaked heightfield and INSIDE the ~34° angle of repose for sand rather than
past it, so the face is steep but not steeper than ground of this material stands. What licenses a steeper face here than upstream is the epoch itself: `e1834_harbor_cut`
is the DREDGED channel, and the south edge of a made cut stands steeper than the alluvial

### L156 — At `light` the sun reaches half as far and the town's small timber casts no shadow, and both numbers are a device's business rather than 1835's

**Decision:** the scene-detail control now changes two things about the SUN as well as the
density of the sward (T-0115, `renderers/web/js/main.js` `DETAIL`). At `light` — which is the
level a phone boots into without anybody touching the control — the shadow box that follows the
visitor steps back from **±240 m to ±120 m**, and the **derived furniture** (the fences, the yard
goods, the plank walks, the wharf decks and the moored hulls) is not drawn into the shadow map at
all. The hanging SIGNBOARDS are the one exception and keep casting at every level: a board is the
only furniture here whose function is to be read from the street, its shadow is what lifts it off
the wall it is bolted to, and dropping it took the release gate's own "the board reaches the
screen" reading from 0.72 to 0.28 against a 0.30 bar. Keeping it costs 1,380 triangles, 1.6 % of
the saving. `full` and `balanced` are unchanged in both respects.

**Nothing states either number and nothing could — but neither is a claim about the town.** The
furniture still stands exactly where its records put it, drawn exactly as it is drawn at every
other level, and it still RECEIVES the shadows of the buildings and the timber around it. What it
stops doing is being drawn a second time for the sun. A fence's PRESENCE is a claim this project
argues from a record; the stripe that fence lays on the ground is lighting, and lighting is not
evidence. The same test is the one L121 applies to the wood one layer over: what may give way is
whatever is a rendering decision rather than a claim.

**Where ±120 m comes from, because a reach is not a free parameter.** It is not invented for this
entry: it is the reach this project shipped between **R-W3b(a)** and **R-W5a2**, chosen then
because ±60 m left 5 to 8 of the town's structures casting anything at all, and superseded only
when collapsing the town to one batch made ±240 m affordable in draw calls. `light` is the level
for machines that cannot afford what R-W5a2 bought. **The map halves with the box**, so the texel
is arithmetically unchanged — 2·120/2048 is 11.7 cm on desktop and 2·120/1024 is 23.4 cm on a
phone, the same two figures the ±240 m rig resolves — which means nothing a visitor stands next to
gets softer. The step costs REACH and nothing else, and it also quarters the shadow map's memory,
which is the largest single GPU allocation this scene makes.

**Why the tier needed this at all, which is the honest part.** Measured on the published mirror at
the release gate's own stand, desktop: `full` 850,657 of its 1,000,000 ceiling, `balanced` 769,279
of 800,000, and `light` **668,293 of 600,000** — eleven percent over. The ladder promises a 40 %
step from `full` to `light`; it was delivering 21.4 %, because the setting had a lever on flora and
trees and on nothing else, and those are 39 % of the frame. A 40 % cut cannot be taken out of 39 %
of a scene. Every layer the town has grown since the tiers were written — fences, goods, walks,
boards, docks, boats — was grown outside the tiers' reach. The ceiling was not re-budgeted to fix
that; the control was given a lever on the rest of what it draws.

**Consequence.** A visitor at `light` sees the same town in the same places, and past 120 m from
where they stand the buildings and trees meet the ground with nothing under them. Within 120 m the
shadows are exactly as sharp as they have ever been. Fences, barrels, plank walks, wharves and
hulls lay no shadow of their own at any distance, so at `light` they read slightly lighter against
the ground they stand on; the hanging boards still do. Measured at the gate's stand: desktop
668,293 → 584,761 of 600,000 and 55 → 49 draw calls; mobile 639,379 → 555,847 and 53 → 47. As L121 already
says of the wood, no figure in this repository is quoted at `light`: every banked measurement and
every published number is `full`, which this parcel does not touch.

**How to resolve:** the same instrument L121 asks for — a frame-time measurement on a real
low-end machine — would say whether the step is the right size, or whether the honest answer is
cascades (**R-W3b(b)**), which would spend the texels where they are looked at and make the step
unnecessary. Chunking the town-wide furniture meshes so a fence behind the camera is culled is the
other measured route, and it would cost the visitor nothing at all.

### L169 — The signs read as the trade wrote them: thirty-three boards re-worded, fourteen off the firms' own advertisements, and one painted device
**Decision:** the wording on a signboard is now its OWN field, separate from the structure
record's `name`, and the two are allowed to differ. Every one of the thirty-three boards is
re-lettered in the period's register — **proprietor or firm first and largest, the trade beneath,
the place last and smallest** — out of `SIGN_WORDING` in
`tools/generate_business_signboards.py`. Fourteen carry a firm's OWN ADVERTISED LINE and are
graded **`inferred`**; nineteen have no surviving advertisement and are **`reconstructed`** from
the trade vocabulary those same advertisements evidence. Not one is `attested`, and the reason is
in the next paragraph. One board carries a **painted device** — Philo Carpenter's golden mortar.
No board carries this project's descriptive building label, the word "log", or a modern nickname.

**Why:** the owner, 2026-08-21, of the Carpenter board T-0066 had shipped: *"philo would not have
referred to his own place as log drug store, it would be philo carpenter, drugs and medicines, or
druggist or whatever he would have referred to himself as on the sign, that may be different than
the name of the building for us, the sign may read differently historically."* And of the next
one: *"same with hogan's store."* And, widening it to the set: *"i guess do a pass on all those
signs and make sure they feel right for the era."* He then supplied **seven pages of 1833-35
Chicago newspaper advertising** in which the town's businesses write their own copy.

**WHAT T-0066 GOT WRONG, IN ONE SENTENCE.** It painted the record's own `name`, less a trailing
parenthetical, and its docstring defended that: *"the card a visitor opens by tapping the board
has to say what the board says."* That collapsed two different objects. A record's `name` is OUR
LABEL FOR A STRUCTURE — descriptive, disambiguating, written so a modern reader knows which
building is meant. A SIGNBOARD carries what the TRADE lettered. No druggist painted the
construction of his own shop on his own board, and thirty-three boards were carrying museum
captions.

**THE TIER, AND WHY NOTHING IS `attested`.** The seven pages were supplied as IMAGES IN
CONVERSATION and are **not committed to `data/sources/assets/`**, so a wording taken off them is a
transcription and a transcription is not a citation. The owner ruled that the work should proceed
anyway, verbatim: *"I will give you all those data sources later in a more comprehensive form
proceed where you can and label reconstruction or inferred with a note as you like."* So every
newspaper-derived wording is `inferred`, and **every one of those notes quotes what its
advertisement says, names its page and date, states that the transcription came from
owner-supplied images on 2026-08-21 pending a committed source record, and says in terms that the
value is to be UPGRADED TO `attested` when those sources land.** Goss & Cobb's is the nearest of
the fourteen — its page is committed already, at
`data/sources/assets/chicago_democrat_1833_11_26/` — and what keeps even that one `inferred` is
that an advertisement heading is still not a description of a signboard.

**What the register is, and it is taken from the sources rather than from a modern eye.** Both
exemplars put the man or the firm on the top line in the largest letter, the trade beneath in a
second face, and the place last and smallest: *"PHILO CARPENTER, Wholesale & Retail Druggist … 
South Water Street, Chicago"* and *"BREWSTER, HOGAN & CO. Forwarding & Commission MERCHANTS,
Chicago—Illinois."* The record carries the role of each line (`sign_lines`) and
`renderers/web/js/signage.js` letters the hierarchy — `ROLE_WEIGHT` sets the type sizes, which is
invented; the ORDER is the advertisements'. **Period spelling is theirs and is kept**
("Steam-Boat Hotel", "Chicago—Illinois"). **1835 beats 1833** where a firm advertises in both,
because the scene is 1 July 1835 and firms rewrote their lines — Carpenter reads "Drugs and
Medicines" in 1833 and calls himself a "Wholesale & Retail Druggist" by 1835, and this town now
shows both: the 1833 line on his 1832 Lake Street log shop, the 1835 line on the South Water
store the advertisement actually places.

**HOW MUCH OF AN ENTRY IS LETTERED IS DECIDED BY THE MOUNTING**, which is why the wording is
resolved after the mounting rather than before it. A plank swinging over a footway carries two
lines; a board fixed flat on a wall and a name painted across a whole front carry three. A
signwriter letters what fits, and a place line dropped for want of room says so in the record's
own `sign_text_from`.

**AN IDENTITY IS CORRECTED, NOT ONLY A WORDING.** "Hogan's Store" is a shorthand for one partner.
The firm's own advertisement reads **BREWSTER, HOGAN & CO.**, forwarding and commission merchants,
and the building's own record already knew — its `aka` carries "Brewster, Hogan & Co.'s store" and
its change note names the firm. The pages also distinguish a SECOND Hogan, J. S. C. Hogan's dry
goods store on South Water one door below Dearborn, which this model does not carry; that is a
placement finding and is recorded in the record's own `findings` rather than silently answered.

**THE GOLDEN MORTAR, AND WHY IT IS NOT L25 BEING OVERTURNED.** Carpenter's 1835 advertisement
heads itself *"AT THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN MORTAR"* — a Chicago signboard described in print by the
man who owned it, in the scene year. A mortar and pestle is the druggist's universal device, and a
Detroit house advertising on the same pages "at the sign of the Large Pitcher" shows the
convention was live and ordinary. So the device is **painted on his board** rather than the phrase
being lettered: the sign is the thing he described. **L25 STANDS AND IS NOT TOUCHED.** It withholds
the Wolf Point wolf because that IMAGE was never described — the opposite case to a shop whose
owner describes his own board. What is invented here is the DRAUGHTSMANSHIP: a plain bowl, rim and
pestle, no ornament and no ground line, graded `inferred` on the same footing as the wordings and
upgradeable with them. **The device does not generalise.** A device belongs to a shop only where
that shop's own advertisement names one; exactly one does, and `tools/smoke_renderer.mjs` pins the
count at one rather than bounding it below, so a later run cannot quietly deal mortars to the
other druggist.

**THE SMOKE CHECK IS CORRECTED, NOT RELAXED, and the distinction matters because a check that gets
weaker usually got weaker to go green.** T-0066 asserted STRING EQUALITY between the painted name
and the card's name, at one board. Held to equality the board could only ever be the museum
caption, so the invariant was wrong by design once the two fields separated. What replaces it is
`sign_identity`: the proprietor, the firm or the house, which must appear in the board AND in the
card. That is now asserted three ways where equality was asserted one — at the Tremont's board
against the card the pick actually opened, over EVERY sign in the town, and alongside two new
absolute assertions (no board carries the word "log"; every board letters a trade as well as a
proprietor). The generator refuses to build if any of it fails, so the old behaviour cannot come
back by accident.

**Consequence:** a visitor walking South Water Street reads *PHILO CARPENTER · DRUGGIST* under a
gilt mortar, *JONES · GROCERY & PROVISION STORE*, *BREWSTER, HOGAN & CO. · FORWARDING &
COMMISSION*, *JOHN DAVIS · STEAM-BOAT HOTEL · NORTH WATER STREET* — and fourteen of those lines
are the firms' own words rather than ours. The counterweight is unchanged: every VERTEX of the
layer is still graded `reconstructed`, because the fact that any of these buildings carried a sign
at all is still an invention (L130), so hiding that level takes all thirty-three down at once and
leaves the town mute with one wolf sign at the forks. What has changed is that the words on them
are no longer entirely ours.

**And it is triangle-neutral.** The lettering is still one canvas atlas sampled by uvs the boards
already carried, so a three-line wording in a hierarchy costs exactly what a one-line name cost:
nothing. The painted device is canvas too — **zero triangles**. The only geometry that moved is
board SIZE: a board is now measured off its longest LINE rather than off one run of words, with a
little more width per extra line and, on the two mountings fixed to a building, a little more
height. The layer draws the same 1,106 triangles in the same one draw call.

**How to resolve:** commit the seven pages. Everything above that is graded `inferred` names its
page in its own note and is waiting for a source record to cite.

### L172 — At `light` the town's small timber is not drawn beyond 350 m, and the distance is a device's business rather than 1835's
**Decision:** the scene-detail control now changes a third thing about the derived furniture, and
this one is DISTANCE (T-0150, `renderers/web/js/main.js` `FURNITURE_REACH_LIGHT_M`). At `light` —
the level a phone boots into without anybody touching the control — a chunk of the fences, the
yard goods, the plank walks, the wharf decks or the moored hulls is not submitted at all once its
whole bounding sphere lies more than **350 m** from the eye. `full` and `balanced` draw everything,
at every distance, exactly as before, and so does `light` the moment you walk toward it. The
hanging signboards are outside the policy at every level for the reason L156 gives.

**Nothing is moved, nothing is re-graded and nothing is un-built.** Every fence stands where its
record puts it; the census counts it, the confidence view tints it, a card opens on it, and the
walker still collides with what it always collided with. What changes is only whether a mesh whose
members are two and a half pixels tall is handed to the GPU. That is the same test L121 and L156
apply one layer over: what may give way is whatever is a rendering decision rather than a claim,
and a chunk's visibility from 400 m away is not evidence about 1835.

**Where 350 m comes from, because a reach is not a free parameter.** It was measured before it was
set, with `tools/measure_furniture_reach.mjs`, at the whole five-stand set T-0135 named and at both
release viewports, driving the shipped cull rather than a model of it and holding the clock so the
wind is not counted as a change (the tool prints a residual of the baseline against itself; it is 0
everywhere). At the worst stand — Lake Street east from Canal, where nothing occludes anything —
`light` goes from 998,073 triangles and 177 draw calls to **745,933 and 70** on desktop, and from
966,541 / 167 to 717,793 / 65 on mobile. The 48² frame signature moves by a worst cell of **4**
counts of 255 there, against the 6-and-mean-0.30 bar the gates use to prove a whole layer is
visible at all. Three of the five stands do not move by a single count.

**The one stand that pays, said plainly.** The open aerial is a camera 175 m up, so its slant range
takes in the whole town at once and the cull arrives everywhere in the frame together: worst 6,
mean 0.03. At 300 m — the figure T-0149 itself suggested — that doubles to 13 and mean 0.06, and at
250 m it runs to 23 and 0.18. 350 m is the knee, and it keeps 252,140 of the 258,094 triangles and
107 of the 110 calls that 300 m would have won. 400 m would cost the aerial nothing measurable at
all and leaves 28,904 triangles and 37 calls on the table; the trade was taken toward the tier's own
purpose, which is the machine that needs the floor.

**Why the tier needed this, which is the honest part.** T-0135 walked five stands instead of one and
found `light` 65 % over its ceiling at viewpoints the Go-to menu already offers. The owner raised
the ceilings to carry it, which made a dishonest number honest and left `light` at 1,050,000 — more
than `full` had promised the day before, so the bottom rung was no longer a floor anyone could be
promised. This is the first of the three pieces of T-0149 that win it back. The ceilings themselves
are deliberately NOT lowered here: that is T-0147, and it is separate so that a ceiling cannot come
down in the same breath as the trim that justified it.

**How to resolve:** nothing to resolve — it is a rendering decision and it is reversible from the
Settings panel by choosing `balanced` or `full`. What would retire it is the instrument L121 and
L156 both ask for: a frame-time measurement on a real low-end machine, which would say whether the
bottom rung needs the trim at all.

### L181 — Three poplar rows on the greens of the town's oldest houses, from a treatment attested at a fourth that is not in this scene
**Decision:** `data/flora/plantings/town_planted_rows.json` stands twelve Lombardy poplars —
four to a row, 3.5 m apart, in a straight file parallel to the waterline — on the river greens
of `jb_beaubien_homestead` (18.0 m), `cobweb_castle` (15.5 m) and `clybourn_cabins` (12.0 m).
Every coordinate, every height and the extension of the treatment to these three addresses are
`reconstructed`, dealt by the rule in `tools/generate_planted_rows.py` and re-derived byte for
byte on every commit. The species is newly held in `data/flora/zones/z10_settled_town.json` at
a density of **zero per hectare**, and the zero is a claim: nothing grows this tree here, so no
density over the settled town may ever deal one and every stem in the scene is stated by that
record. `renderers/web/js/trees.js` gains the archetype it is drawn with — bole diameter, fork
height, puff count, bark — invented within that file's own range like every number in its
`SPECIES` table, and a `columnar` branch in `addTree` that files the foliage masses evenly up
the leader instead of scattering them, which redraws the dune's quaking aspen and balsam poplar
as well at no change in triangle cost.

**What is ATTESTED, and it is the whole reason this is not a reconstruction from nothing.**
Juliette Kinzie, *Wau-Bun*, ch. XVII "Chicago in 1831", of the mansion on the north bank facing
the fort: *"A broad green space was inclosed between it and the river, and shaded by a row of
Lombardy poplars."* Species, row, fenced green and side of the house, from somebody who lived
there. Seven committed plates draw that row, and five independently drawn ones agree on **four
stems at 0.195 of their own height apart, sd 0.010** — measured column by column off the plates'
own skylines, not remembered. The count and the rhythm in this record are that measurement.

**What is NOT attested, measured and stated:** a second address. Every one of the seven plates
draws the poplars at the same place, the Kinzie group on the north bank; not one shows a
Lombardy poplar at the fort, on South Water Street, or in any town view, and no text reached
places one elsewhere. **And the house the row is attested at is excluded from this scene**
(`data/exclusions.json` → `kinzie_house`, gone by 1835; its cottonwoods stay). So the source
carries a TREATMENT and one location, and the location is unavailable — the same shape as L129's
garden pickets, and answered the same way: the treatment is the source's, and a RULE says which
ground gets it.

**What bounds the invention.** The rule's load-bearing clause is age *as the dataset can
evidence it*: a dwelling qualifies only if its own `documented_range.from` predates 1830, five
growing seasons before the scene date. That refuses 133 of the town's 137 houses. It is
deliberately NOT read as "those houses were new" — 131 of them carry a 1835 date because their
records say *"no evidence establishes that this particular building existed"*, which is an
admission of ignorance — but the consequence is the same either way, and it is the point: a
grown ornamental at a house of unknown age is an invention resting on an invention. The fourth
house that passes, James Kinzie's at Wolf Point, is refused **with its number** — 7.7 m of open
ground to the water, under the 12 m this rule asks of a green — because a strip is not a green.
Every other clause is derived from committed geometry: the green is measured from the waterline
back to the house's own footprint edge; the row's direction is the local waterline's, read off
the committed heightfield over an 8 m span, so a row is parallel to the water and not to a
compass point; and every stem must clear each committed footprint, street track, fence line and
neighbouring stem by the margins `generate_dooryard_plantings.py` asks of a dooryard tree. A row
that cannot lay all four stems is refused whole, because a row of two is not the treatment.

**What is invented outright:** the three addresses; that the row stands on the river side of the
green (0.60 of the way over, capped at 24 m from the house, so a row stays a house's row); the
metre a growing season that turns a house's documented age into a height; and the species' 12–18 m
band, whose ceiling is the *floor* of the eastern cottonwood's band in the same record because
every plate that draws both draws the cottonwoods standing above the poplars — which is Wau-Bun's
reading too, since the cottonwoods are the "immense" ones.

**Consequence:** three of the oldest houses in the town now carry the one ornamental planting
this project can quote a source for, and the Agency House's row stands on the north-bank green
facing Fort Dearborn — a few hundred metres east of the green Wau-Bun describes, which is as
close as a scene without the Kinzie mansion can come. The cost is twelve trees nobody attests at
those addresses, and the confidence channel says so on every stem.

**How to resolve:** any sale notice, diary, view, plat annotation or nurseryman's list that
places a Lombardy poplar at a second Chicago address would move these rows from `reconstructed`
toward `inferred`; **T-0055**'s source record for the Kinzie-view plate would let the record cite
a plate rather than a committed path; and a photograph-era survivor's girth would replace the
height band.

### L182 — The end rule's criterion becomes the walk to the drawbridge, and the rule gains a floor
**Decision:** the END RULE — which of the roofs a block was dealt stands where along its
frontage — keeps the claim it has made since T-A8, that **the better roof stands nearer the
Dearborn Street drawbridge, the only crossing of the main stem in July 1835**, and changes how
that distance is measured. From 2026-08-27 it is the distance **walked along the committed
street centrelines** from the roof's own frontage to the bridge's south abutment, not T-A11's
straight line to it. The decision is carried in
`data/reconstruction/1835_platted_block_parcels.json` → `placement_rule.end_rule`, where the
next parcel reads it, and `tools/measure_end_rule.py` prints the number so it is quoted rather
than re-argued.

**THE CLAIM IS AND ALWAYS WAS AN INVENTION.** No source this project holds says a better
dwelling stood nearer the bridge, or nearer anything. L102, L104 and L106 say so of the same
rule and nothing here promotes it. What is being chosen is how to order an invention, and the
only honest reasons to prefer one ordering to another are that it can tell its own cases apart
and that it does not dress rounding up as reasoning.

**WHAT WAS MEASURED, on all 36 faces of the platted grid.** The straight line measures how far
away the BLOCK is, not where a roof stands on it: its worst step between two neighbouring
party-line units falls from **6.06 m** on the blocks a kilometre out to **0.52 m** at
`blk_randolph_clark`, because the bridge's bearing swings round toward the face and the
criterion sees only the sine of the angle between them. It goes blind as a block approaches the
bridge — weakest exactly where the bridge matters most. **It is below the floor on 12 of the 36
faces**, the back face of `blk_south_water_clark` — the block T-A11 wrote the rule on — among
them. The walk grades all 36, at a constant **6.072 m** step, because a metre of frontage is a
metre of walk on every face of every block.

**THE FLOOR IS THE PLACEMENT'S OWN DECLARED INVENTION AND IS NOT INVENTED FOR THE OCCASION.**
The recipe deals its 48 principal slots setbacks from **4.0 m to 7.5 m** and grades them, in its
own `placement_rule`, "a period typology and not a measurement of this lot". A setback moves a
roof along the face's outward normal, broadly the axis the end rule grades along, so that
**3.50 m** range is admitted positional invention measured along the very line the criterion
reads. A criterion separating two neighbouring roofs by less than it is grading its own noise.
The rule now states that where its step falls at or below that range the parcel **records the
within-face order as arbitrary** rather than claiming a grading. Under the walk no committed
face is in that position; the clause exists so the next exhaustion is caught by the command and
not by a fifth block.

**NOTHING THAT STANDS MOVED, AND THAT IS WHY THE DECISION COULD BE TAKEN.** The two criteria
name **the same nearest lot on 36 of 36** platted block faces. K31 warned that the successor
must not be chosen on a block where it agrees with the old rule; the answer is that they agree
EVERYWHERE, so no block could ever have discriminated between them and the choice was never
about which roof goes where. Not one roof is re-graded, no arrangement note written before this
date is touched, and L102 onward stand verbatim.

**WHAT THE RULE IS NOW ASKED TO DO, which is not what it was built for.** Until T-0079 a block
carried one principal roof per platted lot, so the end rule ordered LOTS about 24.6 m apart. The
core density standard retired that ceiling and a party-line run stands three units on ONE lot,
about 6 m apart — so since T-0079 the rule has been ranking the front doors of what the plat
calls a single property and no parcel said so. Under the straight line that step was 0.52 m to
3.53 m across the Randolph–Washington row; under the walk it is the unit's own width.

**How to resolve:** nothing about 1835 resolves it. A source placing any named 1835 dwelling
against its neighbours on one block face would replace the rule outright rather than re-grade
it; short of that, what is available is a better-argued ordering, and the command is where the
argument would have to beat this one.

### L183 — A party-line unit's card said it stood in a river row on streets 400 m from the water
**Decision:** `tools/generate_block_infill.py` composes the two lines a visitor reads first on a
party-line unit's card — the bold location line and the position's own reasoning beside it — and
both were written for T-0078's run on South Water Street, where every literal in them was true.
They have been printed verbatim on every frontage run since. Three claims are removed and
nothing else changes: the location line said the building was **"one unit of the party-line
river row"** and now says "one unit of the party-line row along it"; the note called the block
face **"the town's river business front"** and now names the street the face actually fronts;
and the note said the front looks at that street **"and the river beyond it, as every documented
store on this face does"** and now says it looks square at the street.

**WHY IT IS A LIBERTY AND NOT ONLY A TYPO.** Those sentences were the record's own account of
what a visitor was looking at, and on 9 of the 23 records carrying them they described a
different street. Three houses on **Washington Street**, 400 m from the water, were told they
stood in a river row and faced a river; Washington's entire documented 1835 frontage is the
estray pen, the town's pound for stray animals (`tools/measure_street_frontage.py randolph
washington`: 1 documented record, 0 inferred households). Three more stand on Randolph and three
on Lake. The remaining 14 are on South Water, where the sentences were true and stay true.

**WHAT DID NOT CHANGE, and it is the whole of the geometry.** Not one coordinate, bearing,
footprint or setback moved: the phrases describe the placement, they do not decide it. All 23
records re-derive from the same recipe and the same committed block boundaries, and the gates
that measure party walls, street lines and corridor intrusion read exactly what they read
before.

**WHAT IS STILL BORROWED, and the note now says so.** The 1834 South Water Street view is real
evidence for the TREATMENT — a continuous working row of party walls rather than detached
cottages set back on grass — and a row standing on any other face of the town is borrowing that
treatment from one street. The note says that in terms instead of implying the view drew this
row.

**How to resolve:** a source describing a continuous built row on Randolph, Washington or Lake
in 1835 would let the borrowing be retired for that face. This project holds none.

### L184 — The town's roof total is 662, and how it splits across the three divisions is ours

**Decision:** the authored aggregate `roof_total` moves **665 → 662** and `principal_functional`
**511 → 508**, because three of family I3's six civic slots were shown to count nothing. The three
came OFF the total rather than back into the pool. In the same correction the
`institutional_public` row of the district×group matrix is set to the census of named institutional
records — **south 5 / west 1 / north 3**, where it read south 10 / west 1 / north 1 — and that
carries the **South Division target 370 → 365** and the **North Division 150 → 152**. No other row
of the matrix and no other family target moved.

**Why:** T-I3(a) enumerated the town's public buildings from Andreas and found three roofs on
1835-07-01, all three already committed named records. Six was therefore three real buildings and
three slots that counted nothing, and the inventory's arithmetic is closed, so they could not
simply be deleted. The owner ruled on 2026-08-17 — *"close it at 665 or 662 — either is close"* —
and delegated the pick. **662** is taken because the alternative, re-typing three phantom civic
slots into ordinary families by weight, would have invented three dwellings on the strength of an
arithmetic artifact: the slots were a count of nothing, not real roofs filed under the wrong
letter.

**What bounds the invention:** the enumeration bounds the *institutional* half completely — the
row is now nine named records and their divisions, which is evidence rather than judgement, and
`tools/measure_institutional_claims.py` fails the gate if it drifts from them. What is NOT bounded
by any source is **what the totals mean**. No source states how many roofs stood in Chicago on 1
July 1835, nor how they divided between the South, West and North Divisions: 665 was an authored
figure in the owner's reconstruction specification, and 662 is that figure less three. The
`defensible_range` the same specification carries is [565, 765], so both readings sit deep inside
it and the correction is not the difference between a defensible number and an indefensible one —
it is the difference between a number that counts three buildings nobody can name and one that
does not. Likewise **370 → 365 and 150 → 152**: those follow arithmetically from setting the
institutional row to the census while leaving every other row exactly as authored, which is a
choice this project made rather than a fact it read. The alternative — holding the district totals
still and moving two roofs into another group instead — would have invented two dwellings, which
is the same fault at a smaller scale.

**Consequence:** the gate screen reads *338 buildings standing, of the 662 the town held* where it
read 665. The programme's remainder falls **327 → 324** and its coverage-gated balance **299 →
296**. Every I3 slot has left the block schedule — one at `blk_lake_franklin`, one at
`blk_south_water_market`, three in the South balance — so those five deals now name families a
generator will actually build. **Nothing in the scene moved**: no building was added, removed,
re-typed or re-dated, and the standing count is 338 before and after. A visitor comparing two
screenshots sees one number on the gate panel change and nothing else.

**How to resolve:** a source that states the town's building count on or near the scene date, or a
division-by-division count. Andreas's November 1835 town census gives **3,265 people in 398
dwellings** four months later, which this project already quotes on the gate screen as the *town's*
recorded figure and deliberately does not convert into a roof count for 1 July — dwellings are not
roofs, four months is a building season in a town that was doubling, and the conversion would be a
third invention stacked on two. If a new public building is ever attested it arrives as a named
record, and the gate now forces the target, the district row and the town total to move with it
consciously rather than quietly.

### L185 — The prairie's forbs are planted at the TOP of every recorded abundance range, not at its middle
**Decision:** the forb stratum's slot count is dealt off the **upper figure** of each species'
own recorded abundance range instead of that range's midpoint
(`renderers/web/js/flora.js`: `stemsHigh` → `subsetOn().densityHigh` → `forbShare`). No record
changes and no record is overwritten: `data/flora` still states exactly what it stated, and the
species lottery — *which* forb fills a slot that is dealt — still runs on the midpoints, so the
mix of the sward is untouched and only the number of slots filled moves. It moves three
communities and only three: the **mesic prairie** from 0.809 to 1.000 of the lattice, the **wet
prairie** from 0.798 to 1.000, the **sand prairie** from 0.210 to 0.329. The other six forb
layers were already over the lattice's ceiling and are drawn plant for plant as before. The
shrub stratum is deliberately not included — a denser shrub layer is more bushes, not more
bloom.

**Why:** the ticket was "raise the bloom", and R-W4c(b1) had already measured that the bar it
was to be raised against — a 4–6 % flower-load target — is unsourced on one half and does not
reproduce on the other. The owner's ruling on T-0034 allows the bloom to be tuned as a
**reconstructed** value provided the bound is stated and recorded. This is the tightest bound
available, and the reason it is tight is that it never leaves the evidence: **the midpoint was
never a sourced figure either.** Every abundance in `data/flora` is a *range* — 400–900 yellow
coneflowers to the hectare — because a prairie's forb load is not one number, and the renderer
had been quietly reading the average of the two ends and planting every hectare of the town as
the average hectare. Reading the other end of the same range is the same kind of reading, made
deliberately and written down. What it says is that this is a prairie at the dense end of what
its sources describe, and not one plant past it.

**What bounds it:** the record. No species is planted denser than its own record's larger
figure, so the sward cannot leave the envelope its evidence draws however the ranges are read.
The second bound is the lattice, and it is the one that actually bit: `forbShare` clamps at one
plant per lattice slot — 4 slots to a 3.4 m cell, **0.346 forbs per m²** — and the mesic
prairie's records sum to **0.408** at their upper bounds. So the records already ask for
**18 % more bloom than the renderer can draw**, and what a visitor gets is the ceiling, not the
top of the range.

**What it is NOT:** it is not a claim any source makes about 1 July 1835, and it must never be
promoted out of the reconstructed tier. Nobody counted the forbs on this ground. A reader
counting coneflowers per square metre in this walkthrough is reading the upper end of a modern
remnant range, clipped by a rendering lattice — the same warning L32 gives about the grass, one
stratum up.

**Consequence, measured** (`node tools/measure_bloom_headroom.mjs`, desktop, full detail): at
`prairie_west` the frame goes from **206 forbs and 1,617 flower heads to 256 and 1,968**, for
8,191 more sward triangles; at `prairie_south`, 125 and 949 to 155 and 1,122. **And it is the
last raise either prairie can be given.** Both now read a share of 1.000 with no headroom left,
so the next flower needs a different lattice (ROADMAP K58) rather than a different number.

**How to resolve:** a stated stand-level forb density for the specific ground this scene stands
on would replace the choice entirely — it would say where in the range, or outside it, this
prairie sat, and the reading would stop being ours. Failing that, the honest successor is K58:
give the forb stratum a lattice that can carry what the records already ask for, and the clamp
stops deciding how much of the evidence a visitor sees.

### L186 — Which roof form each family gets is one rule, and where the specification offers a shed this town will not build, the record says so and says by how much

**Decision:** `tools/roof_form.py` is the single statement of which of the roof forms a family's
crosswalk roof line offers this project actually builds. **D2, A3, A4 and A5 are built as sheds;
every other family is built with the gable its line also offers** — including the five whose line
names a shed as well (C1, F1, F4, W4, W5). For the three whose own `ridge_ft` band cannot carry a
shed, the refusal is now written on the record itself: **thirteen committed roofs — nine C1 shops,
two F1 freight sheds and two W5 workshops — carry a new sentence on `roof_type` naming the form the
specification offers, the span a shed would have to climb, the ridge band it would miss and how many
of the family's own footprints miss it.** `tools/measure_ridge_reach.py` gates the statement against
what the generators deal, in five ways, and `tools/ridge_model.py` is corrected to model the shed the
archetypes actually build. No geometry moved: prose is not hashed into the staleness recipe, so
thirteen cards changed and not one vertex.

**Why the rule needed one home.** It had five, one literal inside each anonymous parcel — and the
five had already drifted. `generate_north_infill.py`, `generate_west_infill.py` and
`generate_inferred_households.py` named D2, A3, A4 and A5; `generate_block_infill.py` and
`generate_inferred_infill.py` named D2, A3 and A4. One roof stands on the difference:
`recon_1835_south_a5_044` is a gable where the other three A5 utility buildings in this town are
sheds. Nobody chose that and nothing in the repository said it, because there was nowhere for the
rule to be said.

**What was measured, and it corrects the ticket that asked for it in two places.** T-0179 named C1,
F1 and F4 as the families whose ridge band cannot carry a shed. Swept against what the archetypes
actually build:

- **C1** (small shop, `frame_storefront`): the archetype's `_shed_roof` falls from the back wall to
  the facade and never reads the record's gable orientation, so the run is the DEPTH — and **231 of
  the 441 plans C1's own footprint band allows** cannot reach its 15-20 ft ridge band at any eave in
  its 9-11 ft band and any pitch in its 5:12-9:12. Refused, recorded.
- **F1** (freight shed, `outbuilding`): no open side is authored, so the fall is front-to-back down
  32-50 ft. **399 of 441.** Refused, recorded.
- **F4** (lumber shed) is REFUTED. Closed it is 441 of 441, but F4's own entry says `levels: 1/open`,
  "open posts with slab boards" and "part-open sides", and an open long side turns the archetype's
  `shed_axis` to fall across the SHORT span (L73). Across its 24-36 ft width rather than its 45-70 ft
  length, **F4 reaches its ridge band at every footprint in its band.** F4's shed is buildable inside
  F4's own claims; nothing in the specification has to give way for it.
- **W5** (sawmill or riverside shop) is ADDED, and it is a fault in the instrument rather than in the
  ticket. W5 authors no rise:run, and the sweep reported a family with no pitch band before testing
  any form — so W5's shed had never been measured at all. Against the 18 degrees a shed is actually
  dealt, **84 of 441** of its own footprints miss its 20-29 ft ridge band.

The archetype had already said the same thing in its own voice, which is worth more than a gate
saying it: `outbuilding_params.default_roof_type` flips from shed to gable at 5 m of depth, "because
the rise is the run times the pitch and a shallow pitch will not shed water off riven shakes… over
5 m it rises 1.6 m, which is most of a wall again". F1's depth band starts at 9.8 m and F4's at
13.7 m.

**What is INVENTED here, plainly.** Two things, and neither is a reading of any source. First, that
D2, A3, A4 and A5 are the families built with a single slope: the crosswalk offers "gable or shed"
and says nothing about which, so the choice is this project's, bounded by the archetype's own
depth rule and by the ridge band each family authors. Second, the reading of F4's entry as an
open-sided building, which is what puts its shed across the short span — three clauses of F4's own
entry say the building is open, but nothing states which elevation, and one open long side is the
minimum that turns the axis. W5's "open work bay" is deliberately NOT read the same way: a framing
bay is not a whole open elevation, and the phrase sits among variants beside "timber piles" and
"rare crane/derrick". That judgement decides W5's verdict, so it is written down rather than left to
a keyword.

**What is refused and NOT recorded on a card:** F4 and W4, whose sheds their bands do carry. Those
two are this town's choice and not the specification's refusal, and the gate prints them as such.
Saying "refused" on a card where the only reason is taste would be the same false-provenance fault
K33 spent a parcel undoing.

**Consequence:** a visitor who opens any of nine anonymous shops, two freight sheds or two workshops
and presses `why` on its roof now reads which other roof the specification allowed and the arithmetic
that rules it out here. Nothing in the town moved. One roof, `recon_1835_south_a5_044`, is still a
gable where its family's rule says shed: flipping it moves committed geometry and needs a bake, so
the hold is named in `roof_form.AWAITING_BAKE`, banked by the gate so it may shrink and not grow, and
owned by **T-0212**.

**How to resolve:** an owner ruling on the crosswalk's `ridge_ft` column — it is written for a
gable's half-span and three families' shed reading cannot live inside it — would retire the refusal
for C1, F1 and W5 rather than recording it. A reading of W5's "open work bay" as an open elevation
would move W5 to `OPEN_SIDED_FAMILIES` and the gate would follow it. Neither is a missing number, so
neither is blocking: what stands today is measured, gated and declared.

### L187 — The log units in the South Water row, and the face rule that had kept them out
**Decision:** the five log dwellings the 665-roof schedule dealt the five South Water blocks
now stand IN the party-line river row on South Water Street, each in place of a frame cottage
that has taken the Lake-face lot the cabin held. Ten records change places —
`..._franklin_d1_04` ↔ `..._franklin_d3_03`, `..._wells_d1_05` ↔ `..._wells_d4_03`,
`..._lasalle_d1_04` ↔ `..._lasalle_d3_03`, `..._clark_d1_04` ↔ `..._clark_d4_02`,
`..._dearborn_d1_05` ↔ `..._dearborn_d3_03` — and **nothing else changes**: no roof is added
or removed, no record changes id, family, footprint or any form value, the schedule's family
totals are untouched, and no household is re-homed. What is admitted here is the arrangement,
which was invented before and is invented now; what has changed is which invention the
evidence supports.

**THE PREMISE OF T-0022 IS REFUTED, AND THE NUMBER IS THE REFUTATION.** L99 and L100 both
recorded the worry in the same words — the programme "has no notion of what a street was for"
and "will keep dealing cabins to commercial frontage" — and ROADMAP K29 proposed the remedy
that follows from believing it: a schedule term weighting the meanest dwelling families off the
business front. Measured, the worry is backwards. Before this parcel, **15 invented buildings
stood on South Water Street's line and not one of them was log**, 13 of the 15 being the
party-line row itself, against a documented record for the same line of 8 buildings of which
one — Hogan's store — is log. Every log dwelling the schedule had dealt those five blocks, all
five, had been put on the Lake face by a rule the recipes state in their own prose: *"the two
best dwellings the schedule deals take its two free lots … and the two meanest take Lake."*
That rule is a preference. It is in no source, it is in no part of the programme, and Lake
Street is the OTHER principal thoroughfare, so it moved the cabins from one commercial frontage
to another and called it a fix.

**What the evidence actually says, and it is three witnesses rather than one.** (i) The
committed record already stands log buildings on the principal-street line and they are TRADE
buildings — `hogan_store` (log, a store, South Water), `philo_carpenter_log_shop` (log, a drug
shop, Lake), `madore_beaubien_house` (log, dwelling and store, South Water), `mansion_house`
(log, a tavern, Lake) — and one street back `james_kinzie_house` is a documented log RESIDENCE
on Lake. (ii) The only picture of this row, image 11 of the owner's brief of 2026-08-18
(*"South Water Street in 1834"*), draws it as *"roughly ten one-storey log and frame buildings
shoulder to shoulder facing the river, two two-storey frame stores anchoring the east end"* —
the same plate T-0078 already cites as the warrant for the party-line treatment. **This project
took the half of that sentence about shape and ignored the half about fabric.** (iii) The
owner's ruling of 2026-08-27 on PR #371's fork, option (b): a business-front lot may carry a
documented store at the street and an anonymous dwelling behind it, so the business front is
not a district a dwelling is kept out of. L148 had already reached the same reading for one
instance on Lake at Clark and said the question stayed open for the schedule; it is closed here.

**What this parcel refuses to do, deliberately.** It does NOT re-apportion the schedule. K29's
frontage term would have moved families between schedule units to keep cabins off the business
front, and the measurement says the business front should have them; a term built on a refuted
premise is worse than no term. The other half of K29 — weighting the trade families C, F and W
ONTO the business front, which the same census does support at 80 % documented trade on South
Water's line — is a genuine schedule change, is invisible until a block is built, and is filed
as its own ticket rather than ridden in on this one.

**What is invented, restated plainly, because the swap does not reduce it.** That any of these
ten buildings stood at all; which of them was of logs; that the log one stood in the row rather
than behind it; and that the row stood shoulder to shoulder. The plate supports the TREATMENT —
a working row of log and frame on the water side of the street — and cannot say which building
was which. Every value on all ten records still grades `reconstructed` with its own note saying
so, and no confidence was upgraded by this parcel.

**Consequence, and the measurement that holds it.** South Water Street's invented street line
goes from **15 buildings, 0 log** to **15 buildings, 5 log**; the documented line beside it is 8
buildings, 1 log. `tools/measure_frontage_fabric.py` is the census and carries the one
assertion, absolutely and with no ratchet: *a principal street's invented frontage may not be
more uniform in construction than the documented record of the same street.* It is red at the
commit before this one and green at this one, and `tools/check.sh` runs it. The row's line, its
length, its anchors, its unit count and the block's open lot are all unchanged; the closest any
moved record comes to anything not its own party wall is **3.14 m**, Wells's cabin to
Carpenter's South Water store, against a 3 m separation gate.

**What moved downstream, and it is derived rather than chosen.** Four layers read whatever building
stands on a lot, and a log cabin is not the footprint of a frame cottage, so they re-derived: dooryard
garden plots 15 → 14, dooryard stems 130 → 128 across 63 → 62 dwellings, and town wagons 68 → 67. The
lot-line fences kept their count exactly (111 fenced lots, 277 runs) and moved geometry only; the
street edge kept all 1,214.5 m of its walk and changed only which building two of its refusal notes
name. No rule was touched to get those numbers.

**How to resolve:** parcel-level tax, deed, assessment or fire-insurance evidence for the South
Water blocks would replace an invented roof with a named one on the same line — the 665-roof
programme's substitution clause — and would say what each unit was built of instead of leaving
it to a ratio the plate does not give. A legible, rights-cleared reproduction of image 11 (still
`unidentified-pending` after T-0075) would let the fabric be read off the plate rather than off
its written description.

dwelling is still at the west end of the South Water run and the roof that took the Lake lot is
still on the Lake lot, at the cabin's own 5.5 m setback and −2.0 m offset. What changed is the
family under it — `..._dearborn_d3_03` is now `..._dearborn_h1_03`, out of the D3 one-room
cottage band and into H1, because a documented notice calls the house on that lot LARGE
(**L222**). Read "the D3 one-room cottage" above as the roof this entry moved, not as the band it

### L188 — Five business-front lots on South Water carry a documented store at the street and anonymous roofs beside and behind it

**Decision:** on five platted lots of the town's business front — `blk_south_water_wells` lots 0
and 2, `blk_south_water_clark` lot 2, `blk_south_water_dearborn` lots 0 and 2 — a **documented**
building stands at the street AND the block programme's own anonymous roofs stand on the same
lot: the party-line frontage run across the face, and on the two lot-0 cases a yard building at
the alley end. Five lots, six anonymous roofs sharing ground with five documented ones. The
documented buildings are H. Jones's grocery, Philo Carpenter's store, Pruyne & Kimball's
drugstore, the Chicago American's office and Frederick Thomas's shop.

**Why:** T-0199 and T-0208, and it is the OWNER'S RULING of 2026-08-27 rather than a
derivation. Reconciling those five records with the committed plat (they had been set back off a
2026 kerb line and stood up to 8.17 m out in the platted roadway) seated each of them on a lot
the 665-roof schedule had already dealt. Nothing collides — all eleven South Water placements
were checked against every committed footprint in the town and the worst overlap is **zero** —
so the refusal was the standard itself, *one principal roof to a lot*, which L144 raised to
three units per lot for a RUN but which still read one documented building as exhausting a lot.
The fork was put to him: give eight roofs and two households back, or let a business-front lot
carry both. **He chose both**, on the reasoning that the geometry already permits it and the
other answer pays eight roofs and two households for a rule the corrected data had itself called
into question. It is the same standard L144 records and the same ask behind it — *"there should
be more and denser buildings. this is important."*

**WHAT IS INVENTED.** That any anonymous building stood on these five lots at all, which L100,
L101, L102 and L103 already claim for the roofs themselves and still do — this entry adds only
the further claim that they stood there **while a documented shop stood in front of them on the
same lot**. No source names an occupant of any of these lots, and none says how many roofs stood
on one. What the owner's own reference for this reach supports is the TREATMENT: *"South Water
Street in 1834"* draws a continuous trading front of log and frame buildings shoulder to
shoulder, which is a street of shared lots rather than of detached cottages. **No coordinate was
authored for it**: not one anonymous roof moved, and the five documented records moved only
across the street, along their block face's own inward normal, by the metres their own
`position.note` records.

**WHAT IS NOT RELAXED, because a liberty that quietly widens is worse than none.** The clause is
bounded to a lot named in its block's own `frontage` run, to a RESEARCHED standing building, and
to one standing AT the street; the store must also be the lot's only other occupant. Nothing
physical moved with it — no overlap, the 1.5 m lot margin, the platted corridor and the
three-metre separation between roofs all still bind, untouched: the one pair that came out at
2.40 m was opened to 3.0 m by widening the recipe's own authored break, not by moving the gate,
and the reason is recorded on that slot as `clear_why`. The rule
and its bounds are in `tools/plat_occupancy.py`; the reasoning is in `docs/ROADMAP.md` K30(d) and
`docs/STATUS.md`.

**How to resolve:** any period document naming an occupant on a numbered South Water lot — an
advertisement giving an address, a tax or insurance description, an itemised loss list — would
replace an invented roof with a named one, which is what the 665-roof programme's substitution
clause exists for. A document showing detached houses set back behind these shops would retire
the shared-lot claim instead.

### L189 — One dark behind every opening in Chicago, at a gloss nobody stated

**Decision:** the 287 dark panels this town uses to stand in for an opening — window and door
panels on 112 frame dwellings, the log cabins' doors, windows and gable vents, the fort's
loopholes and its root-house door, the stockade gate's shut leaves, and the outbuildings'
interiors seen through a board gap, a vent or an open bay — all resolve to ONE row of
`generators/common/materials.py`: `0.072, 0.068, 0.060` at **roughness 0.60**. Two of the three
values they carried are retired. `glass` joins the same family on the sheet at exactly the value
its 48 slots already shipped, `0.09, 0.11, 0.13` at 0.25, unchanged.
**Why:** the town rendered one idea three ways and the spread was in the gloss, which is what
decides whether a surface catches the sun: a doorway on a frame dwelling glinted at 0.35, the
identical doorway on the shed beside it did not at 0.60, and the fort's loopholes sat between
them at 0.40. None of the three carried a word of argument in the file that set it.
**What is invented:** the roughness and the hue, and nothing else. **No source this repository
holds states either, and the word "glass" appears in no source at all** — so this is
`reconstructed`, a deliberate DOWNGRADE from the `inferred` the old `interior_dark` row carried.
Neither number is free, though. The roughness is **bounded by two values already shipping and
placed at their midpoint**: it cannot be `glass`'s 0.25, because EVERY ONE of the 287 slots
carries surfaces that are certainly not glazed — doorways, gaps between boards, open bays,
loopholes, gable vents, the stockade's two shut gate leaves — and at a glazing gloss an open bay
takes the same sun glint a shop window does; and it cannot be the bare fabrics behind it (heavy
timber 0.90, hewn log 0.92, sawn board 0.94), because 156 of the 287 ALSO carry windows, and on
the 112 frame dwellings among them every window is sized off the Green Tree's attested 6 × 8 in
lights (`chicagology_prefire127`, Gale's guest chamber "about 12x12, with two windows 6x8"), so
those panels stand for glazed sash and a sash with no specular reads as a hole knocked in the
wall. No slot in this family is purely one or the other — one slot paints a frame dwelling's
doors AND its windows — which is why the bounds are stated by what a slot paints rather than as
a percentage, and why the value belongs strictly between them.
Nothing says where between them it sits, so it sits at the midpoint, 0.575, taken to the **0.60**
the town already speaks on 117 slots rather than to a newly invented number 0.025 away. The hue
is the warm near-black over the cool one because light reaching an unlit room here has bounced
off timber and lime; a cool cast in an opening is SKY, and sky in an opening is `glass`'s job.
**Consequence:** every opening in the town now catches the light the same way, and on the 170
slots that moved the change a visitor sees is the sheen leaving — windows and doors on 112 frame
dwellings, 44 log cabins, the fort's 13 buildings and the stockade read as recesses rather than
as something faintly wet. **What it does NOT do is claim glazing**: a dwelling's window and a
shed's open bay are still one material, because separating them costs a material on 112 assets
and ROADMAP K36(a)'s palette threshold sits exactly at the count this town carries. That split is
named in `docs/RESEARCH/materials.md` §7.1 and left open.
**How to resolve:** a source that states a glazing — a pane count, a colour, or which buildings
had glass at all — would move `glass` off `reconstructed` and would justify the material a frame
dwelling's windows do not yet have. Nothing reached so far comes close: two records mention a
sash and neither describes it.
**Ticket:** T-0126. **Extends** L157 (the material sheet paints the town), which covers the wall,
roof, log, chinking and heavy-timber families and deliberately left this one. **Supersedes
nothing.**

### L190 — Madison Street's line, and seven street lines carried past their drawn ends, so the missing southern tier could be measured at all

**Decision:** `tools/measure_southern_ground.py` measures how much buildable ground this
reconstruction has south of the town, and to say how large the MISSING piece is it needs two
lines that are not committed geometry. **Madison Street's centreline** is constructed from the
PLSS section corner at State & Madison — `G1` in `data/traces/gcp/wright_1834_gcps.json`, whose
own note calls it *the town plat's SE corner* — carried on the plat's east-west bearing that
Lake, Randolph and Washington agree on to the sixth decimal. **The plat's seven north-south
columns** (Market, Franklin, Wells, LaSalle, Clark, Dearborn, State) are carried south of their
drawn ends on their own terminal bearings. Neither is traced; both are constructions of this
project.

**What that buys, and what it does not.** It buys three figures a visitor now reads on the
ground card and a scheduler reads in `1835_665_roof_programme.json` — Madison is **125.2 m**
south of the modelled field's edge at State, the plat's last tier is **6 blocks / 48 lots /
6.28 ha**, and **0 of 24** of that tier's block-boundary points stand on modelled ground.
**It commits no vertex.** No block, lot, corridor, road, structure or terrain sample is derived
from either construction; the six tier blocks exist only inside the measuring command, are
rebuilt from scratch on every run, and are written to no file. The figures that DO reach the
dataset are distances and areas, and each is a statement about ground this scene does not
contain.

**What bounds the invention.** Madison's line is the same construction, from the same control
point and the same bearing, that **L108** already declared for the United States Reservation's
south boundary — Madison's line continued east of State is that boundary — so nothing new is
being asserted about where Madison ran, and the grade stays `inferred` there too. `G1` carries
a **13.9 m** residual, which is the honest error on the 125.2 m; the working horizontal
uncertainty of anything traced off the 1834 sheets is about **20 m** (`data/datum.json`), so
neither figure is quoted to better than the metre it is printed at. The columns' extrapolation
is used only over **~130 m**, on straight two-point lines whose full drawn length already spans
400 m or more.

**Consequence:** the ground card tells a visitor where this reconstruction stops on the south
and how much of the 1835 plat lies past that line, instead of leaving them to notice the edge
from the air. The cost is that both numbers rest on a modern section corner and a bearing rather
than on an 1835 survey, and the card says so in its own words: *"fixed here from the section
corner at State and Madison"*.

**How to resolve:** a traced Madison from Wright 1834 or the Thompson plat sheet would replace
the construction outright; **T-0219**, the southern heightfield extension, would make the
columns' extrapolation unnecessary by giving them ground to be drawn onto.

### L191 — The wet ground on the public square stops exactly at the platted block line

**Decision:** the whole of the platted public square — `blk_randolph_lasalle`, Randolph to
Washington, Clark to LaSalle — is planted as `z03_sedge_meadow`, the flora dossier's ZONE 3, by an
`include_polygons` ring in that zone's extent rather than by the elevation band the rest of the zone
uses. The ring is the committed plat's block boundary, vertex for vertex;
`tools/measure_public_square.py` fails if it drifts by a centimetre. **No water is drawn**, and that
is asserted at absolute zero by the same tool.

**Why:** because the square is zone 3 *by name in the document that authors zone 3*.
`docs/research/02-flora.md` heads the section "ZONE 3 — SLOUGH & SEDGE MEADOW (**Public Square** →
Tremont House site → river at State St; river-shore strip)", and its § 1.2 calls the slough running
from "the Public Square area (Randolph/Clark/LaSalle/Washington)" the single most important
vegetation feature *inside* the platted grid. The committed extent could never reach it — an
elevation band of +0.6 to +2.2 ft cannot find a block the terrain draws at the South Division plain's
+2.9 ft — and it could not because dossier zone 15, the pond basin, is deferred and unmodelled. So
the square was being planted by the same rule that plants anonymous prairie 800 m west of it, and the
one block in this town that three sources describe as water reached the flora layer nowhere at all.
Lowering the band to reach one address would have moved this community everywhere else in the box.

**What is invented, plainly.** That the wet ground ended at the surveyor's line. A prairie basin does
not stop at a street; the sedge would have thinned across Randolph and Washington and run on down the
drain, and this draws a rectangle because the block boundary is the only edge any source gives —
"~1 city block" (`docs/research/01-terrain-hydrology.md` row 15) and a quotation that names the
square. Invented too: that the community is uniform across the block, when the drain's head is off
the east kerb and the west corners are the two the county built on first.

**What is NOT invented, and it is why the boundary was taken whole rather than drawn.** Not the
community, which is the dossier's. Not the place, which is the dossier's. Not the ring, which is
`data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json`'s. And **not a shape fitted around the buildings** — the
warning T-E5(b) was opened with was that "a partial pond fitted to clear the buildings is a number
chosen to look right", and the answer to it is that nothing here was fitted: the estray pen, the log
jail and the court-house stand *on* this sward, which is what a dried seasonal bed carries and open
water does not.

**What this deliberately does NOT claim.** Water. The zone's own `cover.standing_water_fraction` of
0.10 describes the community in its trough and is not asserted here: measured at 0.5 m over the
block, **0 of 43,885 samples** stand at or below the water surface, the block's entire relief is
1.49 in — inside the terrain spec's own ±0.10 ft of micro-relief "texture, not a claim" — and the
dossier's own bed for zone 15, +1.0 to +2.0 ft, sits 0.84 to 1.96 ft *below* the committed ground.
The pond's date remains `not_established` (`data/terrain/1835_intown_water_dating.json` zone 15) and
its geometry remains deferred. What is drawn is the July sward of ground the sources call seasonally
ponded, on a scene dated 1 July, above a basin nobody has cut.

**How to resolve:** a source that states the wet ground's edge, or a levelling that gives the block a
basin. Either would replace the rectangle; until then the rectangle is the block, and the tool says
so on every commit.

### L192 — Eleven willows outside Fort Dearborn's west wall, on a plate that cannot date them
**Decision:** `data/flora/plantings/fort_dearborn_wood.json` stands **eleven relict black
willows, 9.3–11.4 m, on the ground immediately WEST of Fort Dearborn's palisade** — beyond the
12 m of trodden apron **L174** already claims, wrapping 6 m past each end of that wall and
running 40 m west of it, on a 12.5 m grid. **Existence is graded `reconstructed` and its
`sources` are EMPTY.** Not one coordinate is authored: the band is derived from
`fort_dearborn_palisade`'s own committed `footprint.polygon` and `placement` in the frame
`docs/GLB-CONTRACT.md` fixes, its inner edge is read out of the apron record's own
`apron_width_m`, and `tools/generate_fort_trees.py` re-derives the file byte for byte in
`tools/check.sh`.
**Why:** because **`p4_0` draws a substantial tree mass outside these walls and the render had
none** — T-0044's image-accuracy pass listed it eighth of eight gaps, and `p4_1` draws trees
round the buildings on both banks besides. A garrisoned post standing on bare prairie is what
the render said and it is not what either plate shows.
**THE SIDE IS A CORRECTION, and it is the first half of this entry.** T-0044's row 8 and ticket
T-0098's own title both say the mass stands **east** of the walls. Both were read by eye.
`tools/measure_fort_trees_plate.py` measures the plate instead: segmented for foliage, `p4_0`
carries **33 334 connected pixels of canopy on the frame-RIGHT** of the drawn stockade, running
from the stockade's end clean off the edge of the picture, while the largest connected patch on
the frame-LEFT is **924 px of bank grass on the viewer's own side of the river**, below the
waterline. And frame-right is **WEST**, settled off the stand rather than off the picture:
`p4_0`'s viewpoint is the north bank at local `1145, 300` looking SOUTH, and the committed
`chicago_lighthouse_1832` — 46.8 m west of the fort's centre — draws to the frame-RIGHT of the
fort in the render from that same stand. **L179** struck the same table's row 3 the same week
for the same reason; an eye reading of a lithograph is an impression, and this project places
nothing on an impression.
**AND THE PLATE CANNOT DATE ITS OWN TREES, which is the second half and the reason for the
grade.** `data/exclusions.json` assigns `p4_0`'s flagstaff to **Whistler's FIRST fort of 1803**,
and T-0095 measured the plate's two roofed, lanterned works at 0.435 and 0.521 of the wall —
over the GATE, not at the angles — and reads two such works as first-fort signature besides.
A growing share of this picture is a fort that burned in 1812. Everything struck so far is the
fort's FABRIC, and both forts stood on the same ground — but **a draughtsman working decades
later off first-fort descriptions was drawing a SCENE, and there is no reason his trees are
better dated than his blockhouses.** Nor does the dataset help: `docs/research/02-flora.md`, on
Andreas, ends the South Division's river timber belt **east at Wells Street**, some 900 m west
of this reservation, and `renderers/web/js/trees.js` enforces that limit — so a BELT here would
contradict the dataset outright. A few relict boles on used ground east of a belt's end would
not, and that is exactly what `z10_settled_town` records its black willow as: *"Left along the
bank where the landing was cut."*
**What is invented.** That any tree stood here in 1835 at all. How far west the stand
reaches — 40 m — which the plate cannot bound, because the mass leaves the right edge of the
picture; how far it wraps past the wall's ends — 6 m; how far apart the stems stand — 12.5 m;
and every coordinate and height inside those bounds.
**What is NOT invented.** The SPECIES is the measurement's and not a preference. `p4_0`'s crowns
stand 127 px above the wall foot: 8.8 m scaled on the fort's committed 53 m footprint, 10.9 m
scaled on its committed 3.7 m picket height — the two scales are printed side by side and never
averaged, and they differ by the ±20 % the palisade's own placement note already carries — plus
the 0.54 m the bank falls under the stand, derived from the committed heightfield. Of the three
trees `z10_settled_town` records, exactly one is banded low enough to carry that crown: the
relict black willow at 9–14 m. The relict elm (16–24 m) and the relict cottonwood (18–26 m) are
refused in the record's own prose, and `renderers/web/js/trees.js` would refuse the stem anyway
— a 20 m cottonwood here would tower over a fort the plate draws it level with. Every stem's
height is dealt inside the OVERLAP of the species' recorded band and the measured crown, so it
satisfies the renderer's refusal and the picture at once. And the outline is the refusals' and
not the file's: **13 of 24 dealt grid points are refused** — 6 for standing in the river's own
bend north-west of the fort, 4 on the fort's own trodden apron, 2 inside a committed footprint's
clearance and 1 on a bark canoe the boat layer draws up on this very bank — which is what cuts the stand back to the falling ground between wall and water.
**THIS IS A STAND AND NOT THE PLATE'S MASS, AND THE RECORD SAYS SO.** `p4_0` draws one connected
canopy with no sky through it; these stems stand 12.5 m apart against a recorded 6–10 m crown,
so this canopy does not close. That is the grade above, and the grade alone: the record was first
written as **forty** stems and cut on the evidence.
**AND THE TRIANGLE CEILING TURNED OUT TO BE THE SMALLER HALF OF THAT STORY, WHICH IS WORTH THE
SPACE.** The forty-stem version cost 12,800 triangles and put the release smoke's `balanced` tier
at **1,218,562 of 1,210,000** at its worst stand. Twelve stems cost 3,520 and **still failed it**
— so a control run was taken with this record unmounted altogether: **1,209,926 of 1,210,000,
inside by SEVENTY-FOUR triangles.** A quarter of one tree, on a frame of 1.2 million. The middle
rung had not been overspent by this parcel; it was simply full, and the next visible parcel of any
size was going to fail it whatever it was. `full` carried 1.2 % of headroom in the same runs, so
the squeeze was on `balanced` alone. **That is a fact about the ceiling, so it is answered at the
ceiling**: `balanced` is re-budgeted 1,210,000 → **1,225,000** in `renderers/web/js/main.js`, with
both readings written at the number, on the standing ruling that a performance ceiling is a number
this project chose and not a claim about 1835. `light` is **untouched** at 1,050,000 and reads
815,777 — 22 % under; the floor a weak machine boots into is not spent here. The new figure gives
`balanced` the same proportional headroom `full` carries (about 1 %), so it buys no room for the
parcel after this one — **T-0149** and **T-0147** still own the trim that would win the rung back.
**What this deliberately does NOT claim.** The **two-storey frame house with the double gallery**
that stands inside the mass in `p4_0` is not built: that is a structure record, no source this
project holds identifies it, and a building invented to fill a lithograph is a far larger
liberty than a tree. Nothing here regrades a metre of the bank or changes the ground treatment
under the stand. And the record makes a claim about ONE side of the fort — the other three carry
the apron and nothing else.
**Consequence:** a visitor standing where `p4_0`'s artist stood sees the fort against a scatter
of willows on its river-side flank instead of against empty prairie. The cost is eleven invented
stems, every one carrying `reconstructed`, and a `refused` list naming each of the thirteen points
the rule declined and why.
**How to resolve:** an identification of either plate against a dated original would settle its
date and its fort at once, and is the single thing that would do most for this record; failing
that, an 1830s survey of the United States Reservation showing timber, or a garrison return or
quartermaster's account of wood cut on the reservation.

### L193 — Which side of South Water Street the timber stood on
**Decision:** `FAR_TIMBER.main_stem_belt_east` in `renderers/web/js/trees.js` — the South Side
body of timber along the main stem — is drawn on a line **12.192 m south of the committed
`south_water` centreline**, running from the street's west end at the forks to the mean easting
of the committed `wells` centreline, E **+329.3**. The line is `reconstructed`: it is derived by
`tools/derive_timber_belt.py` and re-derived on every commit, but the **side of the street is an
assertion no source states**.

**What is ATTESTED.** Andreas, through `chicagology_prefire273`: *"On the South Side, a body of
timber grew along the river, extending east as far as Wells Street, and following the bend of the
river, crossed Clark Street, and extending south two or three miles."* That gives the body, the
division, the river as its axis and Wells Street as its east end. It does not give a width, a
near edge, or a side.

**What is DERIVED and not invented.** The line itself is South Water Street's own committed
centreline — the only traced line this dataset holds along that bank — and the east end is the
committed `wells` record, read as the mean of its point eastings, which is exactly the number
`timberEastLimits()` hands the near-field planter for the same limit (ROADMAP K45(b2)). So the
horizon body and the planted wood end at the same street, from one record.

**What is INVENTED: south, by half a platted corridor.** Two things bound it. First, the
project's own reading of the same sentence already puts the survivors in the blocks rather than
on the bank — `docs/research/02-flora.md` records relict native trees at *8–25 /ha in the
north/riverside blocks (South Water–Lake, west of Wells)*. Second, the ground on the other side
is measured and it is the wrong ground: between the street centreline and the water's edge there
are **11.5 m of dry bank at the narrowest and 36.0 m at Wells**, and on 1 July 1835 that strip is the
town's working waterfront — the wharves, the warehouse doors and the frontage the South Water row
was built to face. Half a corridor (12.192 m of the platted 24.384) puts the belt's near edge on
the lot line at the back of the street: the timber begins where the street ends, not in it.

**What the placement is checked against, and it was not tuned to pass.** Every 2 m sample of the
derived line stands **24–49 m from the water's edge**, inside the 30–74 m gallery `communityAt()`
deals from the same bank distance — so the far body stands on ground the near planter's own
classifier independently calls ZONE 5 gallery, and 70 stems already stand in that reach. The
census is **0 of 136 samples over water** against the stub's 39 of 39 (`tools/measure_far_timber.py`).

**Consequence:** a documented body of timber that drew nothing for eleven days is on the skyline
again, and a visitor looking east from the Green Tree or north-east from Randolph sees a treeline
along the south bank that is a reconstruction of its POSITION, not of its existence. If it stood
on the river side instead, the belt is up to 25 m north of where this draws it — under one crown
width at the distance the band is drawn from, and the length, the east end and the bend are
unaffected.

**How to resolve:** any plat annotation, view, sale notice or survey field note that puts standing
timber on the river side of South Water Street, or on a named lot behind it, would settle the side
and move the placement from `reconstructed` toward `inferred`. The 1834 Wright and Hathaway sheets
are held and traced for streets but have not been read for vegetation; that is the nearest
unexamined evidence.

### L194 — A mitred ribbon corner stands up to 29 mm outside the street's own recorded half-width
**Decision:** where a drawn street centreline bends, `renderers/web/js/streets.js` now gives the two
panels that meet there ONE shared corner, on the bisector of their chord normals and `1 / cos(turn/2)`
long, instead of letting each end square to its own chord (T-0184). A corner on the bisector stands
`half_width * (sec(turn/2) - 1)` further from the bend vertex than the recorded half-width does, so
the ribbon covers a thin crescent of ground the street's own `track_width_m` does not reach. Measured
across the whole town, the worst is **29 mm**, at the fort road's 16.7-degree turn at [1075, 38]; a
turn sharp enough to need more is cut into sub-mitres instead, and no corner anywhere may exceed
**40 mm**. Perpendicular to every chord the ribbon is still exactly `track_width_m` wide: what
overhangs is the JOIN, not the road.

**Why:** the alternative is a hole. Square joints left **23.47 m2 of ground inside the nominal ribbon
with no roadway drawn on it** — apex on the centreline, `half * tan(turn/2)` long at the ribbon's
edge — worst 4.29 m2 at South Water Street's west approach, and a visitor walking that bend crossed a
triangle of prairie in the middle of a 10.5 m street. Closing a joint to the ground the record claims
REQUIRES the corner to reach where the two edges meet, and that point is outside the half-width circle
at the vertex by simple geometry. Truncating it back to the circle re-opens a smaller hole; rounding
it inside the circle re-opens a smaller one again. There is no join that both closes the ribbon and
stays inside the half-width at the corner, and this project would rather admit 29 mm than draw a gap.

**What bounds it, and it is a measurement rather than a taste.** The cap is set below the 0.05 m that
`tools/drawn_placement_census.mjs` already tolerates when it holds every drawn road vertex to its own
street's half-width — the gate that catches a mirrored ribbon, run on every release at both viewports.
So the overhang is bounded by an instrument that existed before this liberty and was not touched for
it: the census still reads **0 strays, worst 0.00 m**, and its negative control still fails a mirrored
build. Five bends in the town are too sharp for one mitre (three at 17-20 deg, north_water's 44.1 —
30.5 when this was written, until T-0226 re-derived that street from the committed north bank — and
the fort road's 39.3) and are cut into two or three sub-mitres for 22 triangles town-wide.

**What is NOT invented.** No width, no centreline and no record moved. `track_width_m` is unchanged on
all eighteen streets, the platted corridor is untouched, and the flora-clearing corridor — which asks
the same point-to-centreline question at `half + 0.65` — already reached well past every mitred
corner, so no mitre paints roadway on ground where the sward still grows.

### L195 — The La Salle slough crossing: a whole structure committed on a ruling, and the two earthworks that get a wagon onto it
**Decision:** `data/structures/lasalle_slough_crossing.json` puts a timber street crossing
over the La Salle drain where South Water Street meets it — a 12 m span, 4.27 m wide, on one
log bent at mid-span, its puncheon deck 0.84 m over the water — and
`terrain_spec.json` grades the street up to each end of it as two `fill` approaches
(`lasalle_crossing_west`, `lasalle_crossing_east`) at 1 in 12. **Every attribute of the
structure is `reconstructed`, including whether it existed at all**, and the record says so on
its face rather than in a footnote.
**Why:** the owner ruled on 2026-08-21 (T-0129) that the drain should run unbroken into the
river "and have plank crossings for both the road and the sidewalk". Carrying the water
through the street corridor — L150's amendment — takes the ground out from under South Water
Street, and a graded public street that meets six metres of water either crosses it or stops.
The town trustees ordered South Water pitched and graded from the United States Reservation to
Randolph in August 1833, so it did not stop. The sibling crossing four hundred metres east IS
attested — "where Water Street crossed it a log bridge was needed until after 1840" — and this
record borrows its whole argument, one attribute at a time, saying at each which figure is
being borrowed from a crossing that is not this one.
**What is invented, and what bounded each invention.** The EXISTENCE, first and worst: nothing
records a crossing here. The POSITION is derived rather than authored — the drain's committed
centreline crossed with the street's committed path — but the decision to lay the deck in the
track's SOUTHERN half is this entry's, and it was measured: the river's traced re-entrant opens
northward across this longitude, so the water under the corridor is 6.10 m wide at N +3 and
12.90 m at N +11, and a deck on the platted centreline would have to span sixteen metres of a
river mouth. The SPAN is sized off the stream exactly as the sibling's 8 m is, and comes out at
the same proportion (12 m over 5.55 m of water on its own centre line, dry abutment seats 3.10 and 3.35 m,
against 8 m over 3.30 m and 2.35 m). The WIDTH, 4.27 m, is the one figure that exceeds the sibling and
it is the owner's ask made dimensional: eight feet of wagon way and a six-foot plank footway
beside it, the walk width this project lays everywhere else. Cleaver's documented ten feet
belongs to the BRANCH bridges and is a yardstick here, not a measurement. The CLEARANCE is the
sibling's 0.5 m on the sibling's reasoning, and the measured 0.44 m of water under the deck is
what makes it read the same here. The BENT COUNT is the span's: the sibling argues zero for
8 m and the same carpentry cannot be claimed for 12, so one bent halves it into two 6 m runs —
against the archetype's fallback spacing, which would have put two supports in a six-metre
stream. CONSTRUCTION, DECK KIND, STRINGER and PLANK are local practice from the 1883
old-settlers statement and the sibling record, none of them attested here. The two APPROACHES
are fills where every other approach in this dataset is a cut, because this deck stands over
its banks where the others sit below theirs; their form is invented at the house 1 in 12, and
their one departure from the house pattern is `end_overhang_m` 1.0 against 3.0 — three metres
of fill past each deck end would take two thirds of the channel this ticket opened and put the
owner's bulge back at a smaller scale.
**Consequence:** from the owner's stand the drain runs unbroken into the river and a timber
crossing carries South Water Street over it, walkable end to end — onto the graded fill, across
the deck, off the other side, with water running under the whole span. Every vertex of the
crossing carries `reconstructed` in the confidence channel, so a visitor who hides that tier
loses the crossing and is left looking at the water it spans, which is the honest picture of
what is known here. Aiming at it opens its own card. `tools/measure_slough_crossing.py` takes
the readings on every commit — the drain unbroken from its inland reach to the river, open
water under the deck, dry seats at both abutments — so the deck and the stream cannot drift
apart the way the sibling's did for two months before T-0109 caught it.
**How to resolve:** any period document that crosses this ground — a bridge or culvert order
for South Water Street west of Clark, a grading record, a lot survey, or any view of the
street at La Salle. A source that says the street crossed on FILL would refute the structure
and hand the ground back to L150's superseded reading; that is the shape of the evidence this
entry is waiting for, and it would be welcome.

### L196 — The anonymous roofs get their own siding stocks, dealt in their recipes and not by season

**Decision:** the 131 invented clapboard frame roofs — the anonymous `recon_*` count-units of
the platted blocks and the South, West and North parcels, the `inf_*` roofs raised for
reconstructed households, and `physicians_office` — each carry a `siding_exposure_m` of their
own, from the same four period mill sidings L148 invented (4.5, 5, 5.5 or 6 in to the weather).
It is dealt inside each building's own parcel recipe by `tools/siding_stock.py`: the base stock
is **drawn from the set on the record's stable key**, then advanced until no roof of the same
parcel standing within 60 m hangs the same course. **This supersedes the sentence in L148 that
says derived records "stay on the archetypes' 0.14 m default, counted by the deal as fixed
neighbours"** — they no longer do, and the named deal now reads what each recipe dealt instead
of assuming 0.140 m.

**Why it could not simply be L148's rule again.** L148 keys a building's base stock to its
phase's construction season, and the supply argument behind that key is real: a town sided from
separate shipments of St Joseph sawn lumber did not hang every wall from one pile. But every one
of these 131 records carries `documented_range.from = 1835-01-01`, which is not a construction
season — it is the programme's count-unit convention, the same literal on every anonymous roof
in the town. Keyed to it, all 131 would be dealt ONE stock: the archetypes' single 0.14 m course
put back a step over, a range collapsed to a point, which is the fault this dataset has now
found three times (T-V1's sixty identical North roofs, T-0142's pitch, this). So the key is the
record's own, exactly as `tools/family_bands.py` draws a footprint, an eave and a pitch from the
bands the crosswalk authors as ranges. **The draw is not a claim about which mill supplied which
house.** Nothing here is. What is claimed is only that the town's walls were not all one board.

**What the separation reaches, and what it does not.** A recipe deals its own parcel and no
other, because a recipe that read the other parcels' committed records would make moving one
North roof re-deal the platted blocks and restale their meshes — every future building would
cost a town-wide rebake. So no two roofs of one parcel within 60 m share a stock, and the named
deal (which does see the whole town, and runs last) separates its 24 from all of them. **A pair
straddling two parcels may share, and 16 of the 186 anonymous pairs standing within 60 m of each
other do.** Some sharing is unavoidable in any case: four stocks cannot separate a roof that has
nine neighbours, and the densest stands here have nine. Measured over the whole town, the share
of clapboard pairs within 60 m wearing the same stock falls from **72.2 % (192 of 266) to 7.9 %
(21 of 266)**, and the number of anonymous roofs whose NEAREST neighbour hangs a different
course from **0 of 131 to 120 of 131**.

**Consequence:** a visitor walking any anonymous street — the Randolph and South Water blocks,
the North Division cluster, the West approaches — sees the houses either side of them hang
visibly different board courses, roughly 19 to 25 courses on the same wall height, and cannot
tell from the mesh that the difference was dealt rather than found. The Evidence panel's
`reconstructed` grade and the note on every one of the 131 values say so, and say which key was
used and why it was not the season.

**How to resolve:** the same thing that would resolve L148 — any survivor's account, bill of
lading, mill advertisement or measured photograph stating a board width. Nothing will resolve it
for an individual anonymous roof, because no such roof is a building any document could be about;
a document on the town's lumber stock would replace the whole set's bounds at once.

### L197 — A boarding stair at each wharf's landward edge, because the deck stands proud of its own bank and nothing says how a man got up
**Decision:** every one of the seven river wharves gets a **stair of plank treads at the middle of
its landward edge** — 2.4 m across, 0.75 m of going per tread, and as many treads as the ground
there needs for no single one to rise more than 0.30 m. It is drawn by
`renderers/web/js/wharves.js` from the `boarding_stair_*` figures in
`data/wharves/river_landings.json`, and each tread is published to the walker as a floor along
with the deck itself (T-0058).

**What forced it, measured rather than supposed.** The deck top is the GROUND'S own height along
the landward edge, floored at the record's 0.90 m freeboard over the water so a working deck
stands clear of its own river (L132). This terrain puts the bank at those seven heels between
**0.12 m and 0.58 m**, so every deck stands **0.32 m to 0.78 m** proud of the ground it ties into,
and the walkthrough's step-up rule is 0.35 m (`renderers/web/js/walker.js`, `WALK.stepUp`). Six of
the seven landward edges were therefore unboardable at the moment they became walkable. A dock a
visitor can walk ALONG and cannot get ONTO is a worse artifact than one they can only look at: the
first reads as a bug in the model, the second reads as a wharf.

**What is invented.** That there was a stair at all; that it was of plank; its width; its going;
and the 0.30 m ceiling on a rise. No source describes the landward end of any Chicago river dock.
What bounds each of them:

- **A stair rather than a regrade.** The other honest answer is that the bank was filled up to the
  deck, and that is a claim about the LAND — it would move the terrain record, and this project
  does not move ground to make a walk work. A stair invents only timber this layer already draws.
- **2.4 m across** is two men abreast with a barrel between them, which is what the deck is for.
- **0.75 m of going** keeps the whole stair inside the 2.0 m the deck already ties back into the
  bank plus a metre of approach, so it stands on ground the layer had already claimed.
- **0.30 m of rise** is an ordinary stair rise and is under the walker's own 0.35 m rule with
  margin. It is a CEILING, not a height: the stair divides whatever rise the terrain leaves it
  into equal treads, so how many treads a site takes — one at Kinzie & Hunter's and at Robert
  Kinzie's, two at the five South Water landings — is the heightfield's answer at load and is
  authored nowhere.

**What is NOT claimed.** No handrail, no stringer detail, no ramp, no gangway to a vessel; the
`not_drawn` clause on the record still refuses all of that. Every stair vertex grades
`reconstructed`, the same as the deck it climbs to — the size of these docks is invented and the
way onto them is a weaker claim still.

**How to resolve:** any description or plan of a Chicago river dock's landward end — a wharfage
contract, a builder's account, a lien, or a legible pre-fire photograph of a surviving crib
landing — would replace the invention with a treatment. Evidence that these banks were FILLED to
deck level would remove the stair entirely and move the change into the terrain record instead.

### L198 — The household layer's two Lake-face buildings stand on the committed face, and the 16 mm party wall closes

**Decision:** `inf_bakery_lake` and `inf_butcher_market` — the two inferred-household roofs on
the Lake Street frontage of `blk_lake_clark` — no longer stand at a centre typed into
`data/reconstruction/1835_inferred_household_programme.json`. They stand **on the committed
block face**: their line, their bearing and their outward offset are read from the block boundary
in `data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json` through `tools/block_faces.py`, the module both
anonymous-infill generators already use for their party-line rows. Both front walls now stand at
0.800 m, on the one street line the other seven records on that face stand on, at the face's own
bearing of 0.465. The party wall `recon_1835_south_d3_013` declares with the butcher closes to
**0 mm**, and the residual banked by name in `tools/measure_street_line.py` is **removed rather
than relaxed**: that module now carries no allowance list at all.

**Why:** T-0182. Written as centres at bearing 0, the two stood at **0.804 m and 0.784 m** off a
face that runs at 0.465 — near the line, parallel to nothing, and by an arithmetic nobody
re-derived. Two things rested on that. The party wall was 16 mm open and could not be repaired
from the infill side, so T-0104 had to bank it BY NAME while the household layer's own repair
waited on its own ticket; and L141's 0.80 m setback cites "the alignment the two frontage
buildings already standing on this face use", which was a reading of two free-ground placements
rather than of a line. The 0.80 m is still a convention and not a measurement of 1835 — nothing
here makes it one — but it is now a convention the whole face is built to, instead of a
coincidence two hand-typed coordinates happened to sit near.

**What is NOT invented here, and it is worth being exact.** No roof is added, removed, renamed,
re-familied or re-dimensioned. The household programme's totals do not move — 38 structure
records, 101 reconstructed households, 113 persons, the same ids and the same family bands. The
two footprints are the ones they were, and **no mesh goes stale**: a position is not one of the
inputs a GLB is hashed over, so nothing rebakes. The bakery's centre moves 43 mm and the
butcher's 33 mm; the largest movement any corner of either makes is 84 mm, which is invisible at
any distance a visitor stands.

**WHAT IS INVENTED, and it is the same thing it always was.** That either building existed; that
a bakehouse and a meat market stood on this frontage; that they stood where they stand. What the
programme still authors for each is where ALONG the face its west wall lands — 28.935 m and
68.936 m from the face's west end, which are the positions they already occupied, chosen so this
repair moves no building along the street. That is the same interpretive choice a frontage row
makes as its corner clearance, and it is expressed in the face's own frame rather than as a
coordinate beside the plat. Their positions still grade `reconstructed` and their derivations
still read `not_derivable`: **standing on a derived block face is not standing on a recovered
lot**, and nothing here upgrades a confidence.

**What this supersedes.** L177's paragraph beginning *"What the measurement found that the ticket
did not know"* describes the two buildings as standing at 0.804 m and 0.784 m at bearing 0, and
describes the 16 mm residual as banked and awaiting its own ticket. Both were true when written
and neither is true now; this document is append-only, so the correction is here rather than
there. L141's *"the line the two frontage buildings already standing on this face use"* now reads
straight — those two buildings do use it — but the warrant runs the other way round from the
order the sentence implies, and this entry is where that is written down.

**What now asserts it.** `tools/measure_street_line.py --gate`, in `tools/check.sh`, with no
allowance list: every front wall on the face is projected onto the committed line and a face
carrying more than one is refused, absolutely. Its self-test now asserts that the pair the bank
was written for gets **no** excuse — 16 mm under those exact names is a failure — so the bank
cannot come back without somebody deleting a test that says why it went.

**How to resolve:** any period document placing a named occupant on a numbered lot on this face —
an advertisement giving an address, a tax or insurance description, an itemised 1839 fire loss —
would replace an invented roof with a named one and give the face a line that is a reading rather
than a convention.

### L199 — The bank track below the fort's north gate: two derived ends and an invented line between them
**Decision:** `fort_bank_track` is drawn — a single straight chord, 23.91 m long and 3.60 m wide,
from outside Fort Dearborn's NORTH gate obliquely down the graded bank to the water. L140 refused
this track in as many words: *"The track `p4_0` draws descending the bank from the NORTH gate to the
water is not drawn, because the bank it descends is the flat plateau T-0004 exists to grade and a
ramp down an ungraded bank would be two inventions stacked."* T-0004 graded that reach on
2026-08-20, so the second invention is gone and the first is what this entry admits to.

**What is NOT invented, and it is both ends of the line.** The START is the north gate's own
centre — 26.5 m along a 53 m wall, the same midpoint `tools/measure_fort_gates.py` reads the
shipped leaves at — carried out along the wall's outward normal by **6.740 m**, which is the
standoff the fort road already keeps from the SOUTH gate. Both gates therefore hand their last
stride to the apron's bare trodden earth (L174), and this record invents no second convention for
the north one. The END, `[1133.40, 259.61]`, is the committed heightfield's own Z = 0 waterline on
the easting of the WEST END of the commandant's quarters — the one place on this bank that any
source puts anything, the 1855 Hesler key locating the ferry landing *"under the west chimney of
the Commandant's quarters"*, the same caption this project already reads for that building's two
chimneys and its 25 × 50 ft. The WIDTH is the gate's: 3.60 m, the palisade's committed
`gate_width_m`, rather than a fourth invented distance on this reservation; the corridor is the
fort road's 12.0 m for the same reason.

**READ THE DATE ON THE LANDING, because `wentworth_1881_fort_dearborn` says so on its own face.**
The Hesler key is 1855 and describes the compound after the garrison marched out. It is read here
as an inference that a landing fixed by the shape of a bank stood where it stood twenty years
earlier — never as a measurement of 1835 — and it does not lift this record off `reconstructed`.

**WHAT IS INVENTED is the line between those two points, and its obliquity is the whole of it.**
Nobody traced this track, nobody measured it, and no source names it; the 1830 Harrison plan names
*the Ferry* among the ground round the fort and draws no route to it. What bounds the invention is
the ground. Straight north out of the gate the graded bank falls 3.60 m in under 10 m — about
**1 in 2.7**, a scramble rather than a way to a boat. Swung west onto the landing the same fall
spreads over 23.91 m: **1 in 6.65 mean, 1 in 3.65 at its steepest metre**, measured on the
committed heightfield at `[1140.0, 257.99]`. That worst metre is gentler than ground this project
already draws roadway on — South Water Street reaches 1 in 3.0 at the river bank, Randolph and
Washington 1 in 4.1 — so the swing is what makes the track walkable and is not a shape chosen for
its own sake. It is ONE chord and not several, so no joint opens a wedge of prairie at a bend
(L178, L194), and it is clipped by the water mask like every other track, so it stops at the water
instead of painting a ford.

**Consequence:** a visitor standing where `p4_0`'s artist stood — the north bank, looking south —
sees what the plate draws: a pale track leaving the fort's north gate and running down the bank to
the water's edge, instead of a graded bank with nothing on it. The 1835 name is DESCRIPTIVE and
not a proper name; the 2026 name is the ground the modern bridge approach covers, not a descent of
name.

**How to resolve:** the 1830 Harrison sheet re-read for its road and ferry line specifically —
this project has taken the fort, the garden, the barn and the ferry off that plate and never the
routes between them; or any survey of the United States Reservation before its 1839 subdivision,
which would fix both this line and the landing at once.

### L200 — A non-dwelling is placed by its function, and the town's invented store steps onto the street line
**Decision:** the face rule — *the best dwellings the schedule deals a block take its better
street, the meanest take the back one* — is declared to rank **dwellings only**, and a
non-dwelling roof is placed by its own **function** instead. Two clauses follow, both authored in
`data/reconstruction/1835_platted_block_parcels.json` under
`placement_rule.non_dwelling_placement` and both refused at the generator: a store, warehouse or
workshop takes the block's **better face** by the committed street hierarchy and may never take a
**light** one, and a **commercial** roof stands **ON the street line** rather than back at a
dwelling's typology setback. One roof moved on account of it: `blk_randolph_clark`'s C2
store-residence came forward from **4.5 m to 1.50 m**, out of the row of house fronts it had been
standing in.

**What this replaces is an agent's invention, and it is named as one.** T-A15 was dealt the first
store any block parcel had ever had to place, found the face rule said nothing about a store, and
EXTENDED the ranking to cover it — commerce above the better dwelling — on the reasoning that a
store-residence's claim on the better frontage is *"functional rather than social, the only one of
the six roofs whose purpose requires that a stranger can find it"*. That parcel flagged its own
extension as ROADMAP K32 and asked the next block dealt a commercial family to follow it or refute
it rather than re-decide it privately. This is the refusal: the ranking does not survive, because
the schedule still holds C1…C4, F1…F4, H3, T1 and W1…W5 for blocks not yet built and a warehouse's
claim on frontage is plainly not a store's.

**WHAT IS NOT INVENTED is the function, and that is the whole reason this reading was taken over
the other two.** Of the three readings the ROADMAP set out — keep the ranking, place non-dwellings
by function, or refuse the question — only the second can be READ OFF THE COMMITTED RECORD. This
project holds 48 documented buildings its own reconciliation credits a non-dwelling family, and
where they stand is a measurement rather than an argument. By the traffic class
`data/streets/1835.json` authors for the street each stands nearest: **stores** 15 records, 10
principal, 5 ordinary, **0 light**; **warehouses** 9, all nine principal; **workshops** 7, two
principal, five ordinary, **0 light**; lodging 8, three, four and one; institutions 9, one, four
and four. Not one documented store, warehouse or workshop in this town stands on a light street —
a zero across **31 buildings**, on the three letters a block parcel may actually be dealt. Lodging's
single light-street instance is the Steamboat Hotel, which stands 287 m from the State Street
centreline and does not front it; the institutional families are refused to a block parcel by name
(L93) and no frontage rule reaches them. The setback clause is the same kind of reading: **every
documented store standing on a platted street stands on its line**, thirteen of the fifteen inside
the measured street-line band, the two outside it being Robert Kinzie's store at Wolf Point and the
Miller house, both off the platted grid entirely.

**WHAT IS INVENTED is that these clauses govern an invented building at all.** No source says where
a store stood on a block nobody recorded, because no source says the block carried a store. The
distribution above is 48 buildings in one town in one year and it is not a law of frontage; it is
this project's own reconstruction of what its own documented record does, applied to roofs the same
project invented. The 1.50 m is not a measurement of any store: it is the closest line the plat
module's own margin allows, and it is chosen because it is the line the party-line runs on South
Water and Lake already stand on — one convention rather than a second.

**Consequence:** walk east along Randolph Street from the courthouse square and the store-residence
opposite it now meets the street, three metres ahead of the two houses beside it, instead of sitting
back in line with them. The street-lining yard fence on that face stops one lot short as a result —
the rule that lays it looks for a lot standing back from its own frontage, and a shop front is not
one — so 24.6 m of fence comes off the block and the shop front is what a walker meets.

**How to resolve:** nothing resolves the clauses themselves, which are a reconstruction and are
meant to be read as one. What would move them is more record: a documented store, warehouse or
workshop on a light street would retire the light-street refusal, and any Chicago frontage survey
before the 1839 subdivision would replace the setback convention with a measurement.

| `z06_dense_forest` shrub | 0.403 /m² | 0.346 /m² | **85.8 %** |

The eight that fit are `z09_sand_prairie`'s forbs (0.114 /m²) and every shrub stratum but the dense
forest's. `z07_bur_oak_savanna` records no forbs at all.

**Why this is a liberty and not a defect:** the cell and its four slots were fitted against the
reference photographs on a closed prairie sward (**L32**), where they reproduce what a visitor
should see. They are a **rendering budget**. The moment a community's records ask for more plants
than that budget carries, the budget — and not the evidence — is deciding how much bloom a visitor
gets, and nothing on screen said so. A share of 1.000 reads identically whether the records asked
for 0.36 plants per m² or for 66, so the thin flower floor under the dense timber west of town read
as a gap in the research when it is a gap in the lattice.

**What is NOT ours:** every density in the table is the community's own records, summed at the top
of each species' recorded range (**L185**) and read straight out of `data/flora`. No record is
overwritten, no confidence is upgraded, and the species lottery — *which* forb fills a slot that is
dealt — is untouched, so the MIX of the sward is still the evidence's. What is ours is only how
many slots there are to fill.

**What bounds it, and it is a gate.** `tools/forb_clamp_baseline.json` states each of the ten
layers with the density it asks for, the density the lattice offers it and the fraction between
them, and `node tools/measure_sward_draw.mjs --gate` fails when the measured set stops matching:
a layer joining the ceiling, a layer leaving it, the ceiling moving, or a record's density moving
past half a per cent. So this liberty's figures cannot go stale in silence.

**The count has been wrong twice, and each time for the same reason.** K58 was opened at **six**
forb layers. **L185** then dealt the stratum off the top of each recorded range and pushed the mesic
and the wet prairie onto the ceiling — eight — and the marsh's over-water side made nine when T-0019
first declared it. The tenth is the **shrub** stratum: `z06_dense_forest`'s clump density has been
over this ceiling since **K54** named it, one stratum outside where anybody was counting. That is
what an undeclared ceiling produces, and it is why the declaration is now a gate rather than a
paragraph.

**How to resolve:** ROADMAP **K58** sets out three routes and this entry takes the third — a
per-stratum cell, more than one plant per slot where the record asks for it, or accepting the
ceiling and declaring it. Raising the lattice is not free: it buys its plants in exactly the two
communities that already carry the most geometry, and the scene-detail ceiling is breached today
(tickets **T-0203**, **T-0218**). A stated stand-level density for this specific ground would not
resolve it either, because the clamp would still bind. What resolves it is a lattice that can carry
what the records already ask for.

### L202 — A third slough crossing, on North Water Street, where nothing records one at all
**Decision:** `north_water_slough_crossing` — a 12 m log deck, 3 m wide, laid square across the
attested north-side slough at local **E +183 .. +195, N +156 .. +159**, carrying North Water
Street over the stream at the narrow reach above its funnel. Every dimension and the crossing's
whole existence are `reconstructed`.
**Why:** Wright 1834 draws the slough running north out of the main stem across Kinzie Street to
Michigan Street, and the 1830 plat lays North Water Street along the river's north side. Those
two lines meet, and a platted street that meets a stream either stops at it or gets across it.
Nothing states which. T-0226 re-derived North Water Street from the committed north bank after
finding 477 m of its old line inside the water mask, and had to stop the derived line on the
slough's east shoulder, because a road ribbon may not paint a ford — leaving the North
Division's whole river front with no roadway west of E +240. This is what carries it over, built
at the tier AGENTS.md § *reconstructed is a tier* prescribes rather than left as a gap.
**What is invented, item by item.** That anyone bridged this stream. The date range (opened at
its two siblings', the start of 1833, when the town began building crossings at all; closed at
the end of 1835 by convention). The bearing — laid east-west at rotation 0 across a channel
whose traced centreline bears 010° through this reach. The 12 m span, the 3 m width, the log
construction, the puncheon deck, the 0.25 m stringers, the 0.08 m planks, the zero piers and
the 0.35 m clearance.
**What bounds each of them, because that is the difference between reconstruction and
invention.** The SPAN is the stream's: 6.65 m of open water at this northing on the committed
heightfield, leaving 2.60 m and 2.75 m of dry abutment seat — the proportion both siblings hold
(8 m over 3.30 with 2.35 m seats; 12 m over 5.55 with 3.10 and 3.35). The SITE is the channel's:
this slough is a 68.5 m funnel where it meets the river and a steady 5–7 m channel above it,
with a 2.5 m sill between, so the deck sits above the sill where a town could put a log across.
The WIDTH is the smallest of the three because the street is: North Water Street's own record
calls its traffic `light` and gives it a 6.0 m track, against South Water Street's 10.5 m. The
CLEARANCE is the abutments': the ground stands +0.63 m and +0.73 m where the deck's ends land,
so a walk surface at 0.68 m lies level with the street at both ends and this crossing needs
neither the cut its eldest sibling needed nor the fill the La Salle one did. The CONSTRUCTION,
the DECK KIND and the STRINGERS are local practice — every crossing anybody in this town
described was logs with puncheons on them.
**Consequence:** the North Division's river-front street runs unbroken from the North Branch to
Kinzie Street, and a visitor can walk it. If North Water Street did not in fact reach west of
the slough in 1835 — nothing places a building on that side of it, and the division's own
initial parcel puts its roofs north of N +105 — then this crossing did not stand and the street
should stop where T-0226 stopped it.
**How to resolve:** any period document that puts North Water Street west of the slough, or a
town order for a bridge or culvert on it — a lot survey, a grading order, a Kinzie-ward
assessment. The Chicago Democrat's 1834–35 numbers are the first place to look, and the corpus
this project now holds makes that a readable question rather than an aspiration.

### L203 — Two roofs and a stable on Lake Street at Franklin, and the warehouse slot that was refused rather than massed
**Decision:** lot 4 of `blk_lake_franklin` — an interior lot on the block's Lake Street face,
bounded by Lake, Wells, Randolph and Franklin — carries **two anonymous principal roofs standing
shoulder to shoulder on the Lake frontage** on one line, at one 1.499 m setback, on one shared
party wall: a deep-plan frame cottage anchored at the east end of the lot's own frontage and an
older log dwelling abutting west of it. A stable stands in the same lot's yard at the alley end.
The run occupies 59.60–71.83 m along the block face. Lot 7, on Randolph, is left open. The block's
fourth dealt roof, a large river warehouse, is **deferred and named rather than built**.
**Why:** T-0028, the block programme's ticket, and the first platted block this project has opened
since 2026-08-23, when that ticket re-derived the schedule and found nothing left to open. What
reopened this one is the DEAL rather than street control: until T-0213 weighted the trade families
onto the business front on 2026-08-26 this block was dealt I3 alongside F3, and
`tools/generate_block_infill.py` refuses I3 by name, so T-0188 read the pair on 2026-08-27 and
recorded that the block *"cannot carry a three-unit run as dealt"*. Re-derived with
`tools/reconcile_665.py` the deal is A1, D1, D5 and F3 — three of four buildable.
**THE FACE RULE AND THE END RULE NAME THE SAME LOT,** which is the first thing that makes the
arrangement an argument rather than a preference. `tools/measure_street_frontage.py` counts 16
documented records and 8 inferred households within 25 m of Lake Street's committed centreline
against Randolph's 7 and 7 — the reconstruction column is this programme's own output and does not
vote — so Lake is the block's business face and its free lot takes the row. `tools/measure_end_rule.py`
puts lot 4's frontage 441.12 m from the foot of the Dearborn Street drawbridge against lot 7's
473.20 m straight, and 550.45 m against 668.96 m walked along the committed streets, so lot 7 is the
farther on both readings and is the one left open. Inside the run the same rule grades the roofs:
the better of the two stands at the east end, nearest the only crossing of the main stem in July 1835.
**THE STREET LINE WAS NOT ADOPTED — IT AGREED.** This face carried no frontage-declaring record
before this run, so there was no built line to adopt under L177/T-0104 and the floor is the plat
module's own 1.5 m lot margin. `temple_lake_st_building`, a documented record placed by another
parcel that declares no frontage at all, stands with its front wall 1.492 m off this same face at
75.73–82.52 m along. The run stands at 1.499 m, 7 mm outside it, and stops 3.90 m short of it along
the face. The face reads as one street line, and it does so by coincidence of the data rather than
by anything this parcel chose; it is recorded here so a later run does not mistake the agreement
for a measurement.
**THE REFUSED SLOT, AND WHY IT IS AN ADMISSION RATHER THAN A DROP.** The schedule dealt this block
three principal roofs and one of them is F3, a large river warehouse. This generator authors no
coordinates: every metre comes from a committed lot polygon inside a block bounded by four platted
streets. F3's own crosswalk entry makes water access a precondition of the form — the required
variant is *"multiple cargo doors; landing apron; sparse glazing"* and its assumption note reads
*"Landing apron and cargo-door arrangement must follow site access and cannot extend into water or
duplicate a counted pier"*. Sampled against the committed heightfield `e1834_harbor_cut`, the
nearest water to this block's boundary is 134 m away. So the slot is deferred in the recipe with
its reason, `generate_block_infill.py` now refuses F3 by name, and the roof is still owed: the
wharf and landing ground beyond South Water and Market is where it belongs, and that the deal keeps
sending F3 onto inland platted blocks is filed as **T-0316** against the deal.
**WHAT IS INVENTED.** That any building stood on this ground at all; that there were two of them;
that they stood shoulder to shoulder rather than apart; that the westernmost was of logs; that the
household on the lot kept a stable. Every dimension is sampled inside the family band the
reconstruction spec authors and every value on all three records grades `reconstructed` with its
own note saying so. **No coordinate is authored:** the line, its bearing, the lot's stretch of it
and the end the run packs away from are all read from the committed block boundary in
`data/traces/vectors/thompson_lots.json`. No lot is numbered — this project has never read
Thompson's numbering off a sheet — and the side lot line the row crosses between its two units is
conjectural. **The 662-roof total does not move:** the three roofs come out of
`south_plat_beyond_committed_control`, the district balance waiting on street control past State
and Washington.
**A log dwelling on a business frontage is still an open question** (T-0022), and this parcel does
not settle it; it is one more recorded instance on the same ground L144 recorded the first.
**How to resolve:** any period document placing a named occupant on a numbered lot on the Lake
Street face between Franklin and Wells — an advertisement giving an address, a tax or insurance
description, an itemised loss list — would replace an invented roof with a named one on the same
line, which is what the 665-roof programme's substitution clause exists for. The Democrat and the
American extraction tickets (T-0256 onward) are the corpus most likely to carry one.

### L204 — The fort's flagstaff: Andreas gives it a height, and everything else about the spar is ours
**Decision:** `fort_dearborn_flagstaff` is drawn — a bare tapering spar 15.24 m high standing at the
centre of the parade ground inside Fort Dearborn, carrying no flag.

**Covers:** `fort_dearborn_flagstaff.staff_1833_37.position`, `fort_dearborn_flagstaff.staff_1833_37.footprint`, `fort_dearborn_flagstaff.staff_1833_37.form.roof_type`, `fort_dearborn_flagstaff.staff_1833_37.form.construction`, `fort_dearborn_flagstaff.staff_1833_37.form.paint`

**What is not invented:** the object and its height. Andreas, vol. 1 p. 128, inside his own narrative
section *Chicago from 1833 to 1837*: *"It did not show a single steeple nor a chimney four feet above
any roof. A flagstaff at the fort, some fifty feet high, flaunted, in pleasant weather and on
holidays — a weather-beaten flag …"*, and from the southern approach *"a line of almost indefinable
structures, and the flag over the fort, if perchance it was flying."* That is the SECOND fort, in the
years the scene date sits in, in a text that is not the *"Such was the old Fort previous to 1812"*
passage and not a plate. Fifty feet is 15.24 m. T-0096 asked whether anything but a retrospective
plate could say the 1816 post carried a staff; this is the thing that says so.

**What is invented, and two refusals:** where it stands. Andreas says only *at the fort*. (1)
Whistler's 1808 draught puts the FIRST fort's staff *"in the center of"* its parade — that fort is
excluded whole in `data/exclusions.json`, whose entry closes *"none of it may be borrowed for the
second fort's records"*, and it is not the warrant here. (2) `p4_0`, the retrospective ways plate,
draws a staff that T-0197 measured at **0.495 of the drawn wall run** — over the GATE, wedged between
the two roofed lanterned works T-0095 read as first-fort signature. On that sheet the staff and the
two towers are ONE composition, so raising the staff on it would raise two blockhouses with it, which
is the conflation the image-accuracy pass exists to refuse. What is left is a choice constrained by
the model and not by a source: the parade is the only open ground inside the stockade a fifty-foot
spar can stand on without standing on a range or a roof, and the centre of a rectangle is the only
point on it that does not need a second invention to say why it is there rather than a metre away. It
is set to `fort_dearborn_parade`'s own centre, so the staff moves when the parade does. **That this
lands where the first fort's staff stood is a coincidence of two rectangles and is not
corroboration** — if Whistler were admissible here the record would cite him.

**The spar itself:** no source reached gives it a thickness, a taper, a truck, a step, a stay, a
fabric or a colour. The archetype builds a 0.30 m butt tapering to 0.135 m at the head, eight-sided,
inside a half-metre square of ground that is the smallest plan the archetype allows; `construction:
log` is this vocabulary's nearest true word for a trimmed round spar and picks the town's own hewn
timber colour; `paint: unpainted` is a refusal to whitewash it on no evidence — *"weather-beaten"* in
Andreas describes the flag, not the staff.

**The flag is not drawn:** and that is a decision this entry owns as much as the spar's profile.
Andreas is precise about when it flew — *"in pleasant weather and on holidays"*, and *"if perchance it
was flying."* The scene date is Wednesday 1 July 1835, which is not a holiday, and weather is not
modelled here. A flag on this staff would be a claim about one particular forenoon that the source
explicitly declines to make. The refusal is the same one the fort's shut gates make: a gate that is
shut claims a garrison, not an hour. So a visitor sees a bare staff over the pickets, which is what
the evidence supports and no more.

**Consequence:** the fort acquires the one feature of its silhouette that a town of no steeples and no
tall chimneys could see from anywhere — Andreas's own point in the sentence that attests it. Measured
against both `dev` and this branch's own merge-base, it costs **22 triangles at the two stands the fort
is visible from and zero draw calls anywhere** — the spar batches with the town, and neither of the
desktop ceiling reds standing on 2026-08-28 belongs to it (`docs/RESEARCH/fort_dearborn.md` § 10).

**How to resolve:** a garrison return, a quartermaster's account or a post repair estimate for
1816–1836 would give the staff a position and probably a spar; the 1830 Harrison sheet re-read at
page-image level for a staff symbol on the parade would settle it directly. Wau-Bun, Quaife and
Wentworth's 1881 address were each searched for the word and none of them attests one at the second
fort — see `docs/RESEARCH/fort_dearborn.md` § 10.

### L205 — Five documented men are given reconstructed roofs, and the roofs are still ours
**Decision:** where the newspaper register found a documented practitioner of a trade the town
had INVENTED a household for, the documented man takes that household and the invented name is
retired. Five did on 2026-08-29 — J. Garland (cooper), J. W. Reed (joiner), Dr Josiah C.
Goodhue (physician), Thomas S. Eels (tailor) and J. Shrigley (tavern keeper). Each is graded
`inferred` on his own record and each household says, in its own words, that the dwelling under
him is unchanged.

**What is not invented:** the men and their trades. All five are named in the Chicago Democrat
between December 1833 and October 1834, at the issue and column each record cites, and the
corpus reads a trade for each of them. `data/research/newspapers/register_1835.json` is the
compilation that matched them; `tools/replace_invented_residents.py` is the pass that spent the
match and re-derives it on every commit.

**What is invented, and it is the whole of the placement:** where they lived. Nothing reached
says where any of these five slept, and the dwelling each now heads was raised by the occupation
census — a count of 3,265 people in 398 dwellings against the trades Andreas's 1833 roster
names — and placed by the reconstruction. **Its existence, its position and its footprint are
exactly what they were before this pass ran and are still conjectural.** What changed is WHO is
argued to be under the roof: a man the papers name rather than a name drawn from a pool.

**Why `inferred` and not `attested`.** This vocabulary's middle rung is a real person carrying
reconstructed details, and that is precisely the claim: the person is documented, the household
is not. Grading them `attested` would have quietly promoted the dwelling along with the man,
which is the one thing this pass must not do. The five persons' `name_basis` blocks — the
"THE NAME IS INVENTED" declaration the reconstructed layer carries — are removed rather than
kept, because an invented name is not held beside a documented one; the other 108 keep theirs.

**The refusal that shapes it, and it refuses far more than it takes.** A candidate the papers
place SOMEWHERE IN PARTICULAR — at a street, at a named house, or outside the town — is refused.
J. K. Botsford advertised at the corner of Dearborn and Lake, Bernardus Laughton kept a house on
the Aux Plaines, D. Graves baked on South Water Street: putting any of them on whichever
reconstructed roof this deal happened to reach would contradict their own records. They belong
to the placement tickets (T-0263, T-0306), which stand them where the paper stands them. The
men this pass takes are the ones the papers place NOWHERE, for whom a reconstructed dwelling is
not a contradiction but the honest answer to a question no source answers. Sixty-six candidates
were refused and five accepted; `python3 tools/replace_invented_residents.py --report` prints
every refusal with its reason, so the ratio is auditable rather than asserted.

**A survival bound, stated:** four of the five are last printed in 1834 and the scene date is
1 July 1835. Their presence on that day is assumed and not documented, on the same reasoning the
owner's third ruling of 2026-08-28 applies to businesses — the absence of a removal notice is
what carries them forward. Each household's `arrival` block now carries the paper's own first
sighting as a `not_later_than` bound, which is strictly more than the scene date it used to
carry, and its note says what the bound is and is not.

**Consequence:** five cards a visitor can open stop reading "The Gilbert household — a
reconstructed joiner" over an invented name and a paragraph explaining that the name is invented,
and start reading a man the Chicago Democrat printed, with the issue and column, the trade as the
paper sets it, and a dated bound on when he was here. No geometry moves and no triangle is added.

**How to resolve:** the placement half is T-0263 and T-0306; the minting half — the 1,967 people
the register would add to the town rather than substitute — is T-0264's sibling and is not this
entry. A directory, a tax list or a census for 1835 would replace the reconstructed dwelling
under any of these five with an address, at which point the person's grade rises to `attested`
and this liberty's fifth paragraph is what has been discharged.

### L206 — Sixteen documented tradespeople are written as households of one, and the household is the invention
**Decision:** the newspaper register names people this reconstruction did not hold at all, and
`data/residents/` has no way to carry a person except inside a household. So on 2026-08-29
sixteen of them were written as households of ONE — Byram King (hardware merchant), J. H.
Collins, Henry Moore, R. Stewart, J. Curtiss and H. C. Bennett (attorneys), Samuel Lewis, H.
Crocker and J. A. Marshall (schoolteachers), A. Garrett (auctioneer), H. B. Clarke (hardware),
E. L. Thrall (clothier), Elmira Fowler and Mrs H. Sherman (dressmakers), James Grant (attorney)
and Wm. Sabine (forwarding and commission). `tools/mint_documented_residents.py` derives the set
and re-derives it on every commit.

**What is not invented: the people and their trades.** Each is named in the Chicago Democrat or
the Chicago American at the issue and column their record cites, and the corpus reads a trade for
each. They are graded `attested` on that basis and on nothing else.

**What is invented, and it is only this: that each is a household.** No source reached says any
of them headed a household, lived alone, or lived at all in the sense this dataset means — a roof
with people under it. The container is the dataset's shape, not the paper's claim, and every
record says so: one member, `lives_at` null, `works_at` null, no origin, no party size, no
family, and `division: unplaced` — a sixth division word added for exactly this, meaning the
sources put the household IN the town and nowhere in it. Reading a family or a quarter of town
into these records would be reading something the papers do not say.

**Why `attested` here and `inferred` at L205.** The two passes claim different things. L205 puts
a documented man under a reconstructed ROOF, so the record makes a claim about a dwelling and the
middle rung is the honest one. This pass raises no dwelling and places nothing; the only claim
about the person is that a source names them and gives them a trade, which is what `attested`
means on this layer. Nothing here moves a building, a footprint or a triangle.

**The refusals shape it, and they refuse more than three times what they take.** Fifty-four
candidates were refused and sixteen taken: eighteen whose first evidence falls after the scene
date, nine names the transcription bracketed as uncertain, eight firms that cannot head a
household, six people the corpus places where this project cannot put them in the town (the
mouth of the St. Joseph, Cook county, a store the plat does not carry), five whose family name
the town already uses, four surnames already minted, and four printed as a surname and a trade
and nothing else — the decision index.json already records under `darwin_of_canada`.
`python3 tools/mint_documented_residents.py --report` prints every one with its reason.

**A presence bound, stated:** nine of the sixteen are last printed before 1 July 1835, and their
`present_on_scene_date` is `uncertain` rather than `present` — the same distinction index.json
already draws for Jeremiah Porter. A documented resident whose whereabouts on one day are unknown
is a finding, not a gap, and the card says which it is.

**Consequence:** the Evidence panel's people section goes from 173 households and 209 people to
189 and 225, and sixteen of the new rows carry the orphan chip that says no building card can
reach them — which is the card telling the truth. No figure is drawn (L1).

### L207 — Twelve names from the post office's letter lists are written as households of one, on the thinnest evidence this project accepts for a resident
**Decision:** the owner ruled on 2026-08-28 that a name in the post office's list of
uncalled-for letters is enough to make somebody a resident. On 2026-08-29 twelve of those names —
William Luce, Caleb Foster, Ira Herrick, Nicholas Boilvin, Mary Barrows, Nathan Hutchins,
Chester House, Lyman Bennet, Pierce Downer, Stephen Mack, Robert Lucas and Frederick Myers —
were written as households of ONE,
`division: unplaced`, no trade, no dwelling, no family.
`tools/mint_letter_list_residents.py` derives the set and re-derives it on every commit.

**What is not invented: the names and the letters.** Each is printed in the Chicago Democrat at
the issue and column its record cites, in a list headed as letters remaining in the Post Office
at Chicago and uncalled-for.

**What is invented, and it is the same invention as L206: that each is a household.** No source
says any of them headed one, or lived at all in the sense this dataset means. The container is
the dataset's shape and every record says so.

**WHY TWELVE AND NOT 1,907, which is the number of such names the register carries.** Through
the eight refusals `mint_documented_residents.py` derives, 726 of the 1,907 survive — 476 refused
as garbled, 310 whose first evidence falls after the scene date, 250 for a surname already
minted, 101 because the town already names that family, 22 placed outside the town, 12 as firms,
10 as a surname and nothing else. Minting all 726 would take this town from 225 people to 951 and
make three residents in four a name on a post-office list.
That is a question about the SCALE of the reconstruction, it is the owner's, and it is ticket
**T-0379** with those numbers in it. This pass takes the slice the CORPUS ranks highest instead:
the Democrat reprinted one return over consecutive weekly issues, so a name's printings are not
its returns, and grouping its issues at a gap of more than sixty days separates a reprint from a
genuinely later list. Eighteen names in the pool appear in more than one return and twelve
survive the refusals, five of them from January 1834 to May 1835. A name held once is somebody who was written to. A name held in two
returns sixteen months apart is somebody a correspondent still believed was reachable at Chicago.

**The limit, stated rather than hidden.** The Chicago post office served the country around the
town as well as the town, so an uncalled-for letter is evidence that its writer believed the
addressee reachable at Chicago and NOT proof that he slept there. Refusal 6 catches the names the
corpus places elsewhere; it cannot catch a settler the corpus never places at all. Every one of
the ten records says this in its own person note, and a scan read, a land record or a second
corpus that places one of them outside the town retires that record. Two of the twelve — Pierce
Downer and Nicholas Boilvin — carry names this project can put no source against inside the town,
and they are held on the ruling and the returns alone, which is what that limit means in
practice.

**Precedence between the two minting passes.** Six candidates in more than one return were
refused: five the transcription bracketed as uncertain, and Albert Fowler, because
`mint_documented_residents.py` had already minted Elmira Fowler. A man the papers give a trade is
better evidenced than a name on a letter list, so where the two passes reach for one family name
the documented pass keeps it and this one gives way.

**Consequence:** the people section goes from 189 households and 225 people to 201 and 237;
`households_without_a_dwelling` in the town census moves from 68 to 80 and `housed` does not move,
because none of these twelve is placed anywhere. `letter_list_only` now reaches the visitor's card —
a row of its own on the person and a clause in the section's count sentence — so a letter-list
name and a shopkeeper who advertised his stock can never again read as the same claim. No figure
is drawn (L1).

**The scale question this entry left open has since been answered — see L214.** T-0379 put the
numbers above to the owner and he ruled, on 2026-08-30, HOLD ALL OF THEM: every name these
refusals admit joins the town. So "why twelve and not 1,907" is now a record of how the question
was framed rather than a description of what stands, the twelve are fifteen and then 727, and
L214 carries the change of scale, its share of the town and the gate that binds it.

### L208 — New York House: everything about the building except its storeys and its eaves is ours
**Decision:** the New York House is drawn as a **12.192 × 7.62 m** (40 × 25 ft) clapboarded frame
block, two storeys, unpainted, gable roof at 38°, regular window bays, two stacks, **no gallery**,
its siding dealt from the stock set. Andreas supplies exactly two of those: *"a two-story
building, with eaves to the street"*. Every other value above is the type talking.
**Why:** no source reached gives this building a dimension, a colour, a window, a porch or a
pitch. The footprint is the dataset's stock period commercial rectangle — 40 ft is the frontage
attested for the Green Tree Tavern and for the Western Hotel's front, 25 ft the depth derived from
the Green Tree's attested room module — reused rather than freshly invented, exactly as
`peck_store`, `carpenter_south_water_store` and their neighbours reuse it. **The repetition is the
admission, not an accident.** The one thing the rectangle does claim is the PROPORTION, and that
is documented: `frame_tavern` runs its ridge along the longer axis, so a footprint wider than it
is deep is what puts the eaves, not the gable, on Lake Street. A 25 × 40 ft rectangle would have
turned the gable to the street and contradicted the only elevation fact any source states.
**`gallery: false` is the invention in the negative**, and it is worth naming as one: the front of
this hotel is rendered plain because nobody found evidence either way, not because anybody
recorded a plain front. A two-storey gallery is the kind of thing a description mentions, and none
of the three sources that describe this house mentions one — which is a reason, not evidence.
**What would discharge it:** any dimensioned description, an insurance or tax entry, or a
depiction. `cladding` and `fenestration` are `simplified` rather than absent — clapboard courses
and regular bays stand in the mesh, but neither value drives what is built.

### L209 — "Near Wells" is two blocks, and the free lot chose between them
**Decision:** the New York House stands on **lot 7 of `blk_south_water_franklin`** — the south-tier
lot at the Wells end of the block between Franklin and Wells — centred on that lot's Lake Street
frontage, front wall 1.50 m back from the committed frontage line. It is therefore on the north
side of Lake Street immediately **west** of Wells.
**Why:** Andreas gives the address as *"the north side of Lake Street, near Wells"* and names
neither a corner nor a lot. The north side of Lake Street exists on **both** sides of Wells, and
nothing reached decides between them. The western block is adopted because its Wells-end lot on
Lake is free, while the eastern block's Lake face already carries three dealt roofs — **a reason
about this dataset, not evidence about 1835**, and that is exactly why it is recorded here rather
than argued out on the record.
**The corner is refused, in writing.** Pushing the house east to the Lake and Wells corner would
read better in the scene and would give the two American offices a smarter address. Andreas says
*near* Wells, not *at the corner of*, and a placement inference never sharpens its source (T-0196).
Centring on the Wells-end lot is the least specific placement that still satisfies the words; the
residual is one lot, about 24 m of frontage, which sits inside the georeference's own working
uncertainty of 17.5 m RMS and the record's stated ~30 m.
**What would discharge it:** a source naming the side of Wells, a lot number, or a corner. Any of
them moves the building at most one block east and costs nothing else on the record — the form,
the range, the occupants and the trade are all independent of which block it stands on.
**No `Covers:` token.** The placement is `inferred` and not invented: it is derived from committed
lot geometry and stated to the metre. What is admitted here is the CHOICE between two readings the
source leaves open, which is a navigation decision and has nothing in the data to point at.

### L210 — Six West Division eaves were moved to fit an archetype's door, not a source

**Decision:** T-0272 put the twenty anonymous West Division roofs' eave and roof pitch onto the
family bands the reconstruction specification authors, sampled deterministically per slot,
instead of on one figure per family typed into `tools/generate_west_infill.py`. On six of the
twenty the sampled eave was then MOVED off the value the band alone would have given, by a rule
that is a model's and not a source's, and this entry is that admission.

**Five were raised to a door.** The floor is the height the implemented archetype needs to carry
the door that family's building has, plus its header — asked of the outbuilding archetype's own
door table through `family_bands.eave_floor`, never retyped. `recon_1835_west_011` (A3 privy)
1.952 → 2.084 m; `recon_1835_west_012` (A4 woodshed) 2.047 → 2.189 m; `recon_1835_west_021` (W3
wheelwright shop) 3.247 → 3.269 m; `recon_1835_west_009` (W2 joiner's shop) 3.317 → 3.495 m;
`recon_1835_west_008` (W1 blacksmith shop) 3.564 → 3.598 m. The privy is the same decision the
platted-block parcel already records at **L93**; the three wagon-doored workshops are its twin, a
metre higher because a wagon door is.

**One was redrawn to reach a ridge.** `recon_1835_west_010`, an A1 stable, drew 3.141 m and
stands at 3.371 m, because from 3.141 m no pitch inside the family's own 7:12-10:12 band lands
the ridge inside the family's own 17-24 ft band. Two authored bands disagreed for this plan and
the eave moved rather than the pitch leaving its band (T-0148). The residual, where no eave in a
band can reach its ridge band at all, is reported by `tools/measure_ridge_band.py` and not hidden.

**Every one of the six is still inside its own authored eave band**, so the note printed beside it
— "type-level choice within the {family} band" — is true of the number it sits on, which is the
whole reason T-0272 was worth doing. A family whose entire band sat under its archetype's floor
fails loudly instead of being quietly raised out of its typology.

**What this does NOT license.** It is not evidence that any of these buildings stood, or stood at
this height. Presence, position and footprint remain conjectural under **L92**, every value still
grades `reconstructed`, and nothing here was moved to make a check pass.

### L211 — 101 documented businesses stand on 1 July 1835 because nothing says they closed
**Decision:** every business the newspaper register flags `survival_liberty_required` is
treated as standing at the scene date. Its existence is documented — a dated advertisement
or notice in the *Chicago Democrat* or the *Chicago American* — and its survival to
1835-07-01 is assumed. The assumption is stated HERE and nowhere else: the register carries
the flag, this entry carries the liberty, and no business record is graded `documented` for
a survival nothing witnessed.
**Why:** the corpus is thinnest in the year it most needs to be thick. 189 documented
businesses are present at the scene date and only **88** of them are documented *in* 1835;
the other **101** were last printed between 1833-11-26 and 1834-12-24, a median of 364 days
before the day the town is drawn. Refusing the assumption is the only alternative to making
it, and refusing it empties more than half the documented trade out of Chicago on the
strength of a newspaper run nobody has finished reading — the 1835 issues that would
re-attest most of these houses are still unopened (the `PAPERS` reading tickets). Owner
ruling 3, 2026-08-28: such a business is BUILT, with the liberty stated. The register
already refuses everything that CAN be refused — 13 businesses are excluded by a claim that
contradicts them before the scene date and 4 by an opening announced after it — so this
covers what is left after the evidence has spoken, not instead of it.
**Scope:** `register_1835.businesses[survival_liberty_required]` — 101 businesses, enumerated
by `tools/compile_register.py` from the gazetteer and the committed town, and re-counted by
`tools/compile_liberties.py` on every compile. The number above cannot drift from the
register without `check.sh` saying so, which is the point of writing it down: a scope that
has silently stopped matching its population reads as a measurement and is not one.
**Consequence:** as the register is seeded into the town, half of these reach something a
visitor can see. Measured on the register as it stands on 2026-08-29, **53** of the 101 do —
16 enrich a house already standing, 14 ask for a new building, 23 take a street face — and
**48** reach nothing yet. That split moves whenever an anchor is re-read or two firms are
judged one house, and it is a dated reading rather than a standing claim; the 101 is the
number this entry is held to and the number the gate re-derives. It has now moved three
times for exactly the second reason. This entry was written at 111 the same day T-0345 found
that four of the register's businesses were four readings of Matthias Mason & Co.'s one
blacksmithing notice; T-0400 judged the ten surname groups whose two styles differ only in
the FORM of a forename — whole against abbreviated against bare initial — merging eight of
them and taking the count from 109 to 103; and T-0340 joined the town's only bookshop, whose
sign-name, its partners' firm-name and the shop's own premises stood as separate houses, and
the joined record advertises in August 1835 and needs no survival assumed at all, taking 103
to 101. No movement is a business leaving Chicago; all are shops the register was holding
twice. Every one
of them puts a trade sign, a
card or an occupant into July 1835 on an inference, and a visitor reading such a card is
being told the shop was there when what is known is that it was there the winter before. The
Evidence panel carries this entry so that sentence is available to them; the per-attribute
chips cannot say it, because the thing assumed is not an attribute but a continued existence.
**What is NOT invented:** the business, its trade, its proprietors, its street and its
advertisement are all documented and cited. Only the survival of the concern from its last
printed notice to 1835-07-01 is assumed. Where a claim after the scene date says a firm
dissolved, the register records it (`dissolved_after_scene_date`) and this liberty does not
reach it.
**How to resolve:** read the rest of the 1835 run. A business re-printed in 1835 loses the
flag when `tools/compile_register.py` re-derives, with no edit to this file and none to its
record — so this liberty shrinks by itself as the corpus grows, and the count above is
restated each time it does. It reaches zero when the 1835 papers have been read in full, or
it stops at whatever number the surviving issues cannot reach.
**Ticket:** T-0357. **Related:** T-0354 (how much of the town these businesses may be placed
in at all), T-0263 (the seeding that raises the first of them).
**Recorded:** 2026-08-29.

### L212 — Nineteen documented businesses are seated on reconstructed roofs, and no source puts them there
**Decision:** where the newspaper register can place a business no closer than a platted street,
the business adopts an anonymous reconstructed roof already standing on that street face. The
owner ruled it on 2026-08-29 (T-0354), choosing adoption over a new frontage record with a
conjectural along-street position and over waiting for a corner. Nineteen of the register's 59
`street_only` businesses are seated; `docs/STREET-FACE-ADOPTION.md` is the policy,
`data/research/newspapers/street_face_adoptions.json` the derived table, and
`tools/adopt_street_faces.py --check` re-derives both on every commit. **The seating REACHES THE
BUILDINGS as of T-0417:** `tools/inferred_occupancy.py` hands each adopted roof its `occupants`
block, so the card a visitor opens on that roof names the business rather than showing an
anonymous count-unit. It was 24 for one day; carrying the allocation into the records is what
found that nine of those roofs were yard buildings, which is the refusal below.

**What is not invented:** the businesses, their trades and their streets. Every one of the 19 is
printed in the *Chicago Democrat* or the *Chicago American* at the issue and column its record
cites, and every one names a platted street this model holds — Peter Cohen at the east end of
South Water-street, Miss Bayne's school in Randolph Street, the Chicago Bakery on South Water. The
street is a real constraint and it survives this entry untouched.

**What is invented, and it is the whole of the placement:** WHICH roof on that face. Nothing
reached says where on South Water Street Peter Cohen stood, and the roof he now sits on is an
anonymous count-unit raised by the reconstruction to meet an aggregate roof target. Its existence,
its position and its footprint are exactly what they were before this pass ran and are still
conjectural under **L92**. The pairing is an allocation by a deterministic rule — businesses
ranked by printings, roofs taken in id order — and a rule is not a reading.

**Four things this deliberately does not claim, and each is a field or a gate rather than a
promise.** A lot: every record carries `lot: null` and `claims_lot: false`, and the gate refuses a
record that grows a lot field of any name — the paper's constraint is the face and the lot is the
reconstruction's. A promotion: the adopted roof stays `reconstructed`, and the gate re-reads the
structure's own phase and fails if it has stopped saying so, because the business is documented
and the building under it is not. An along-street position: `order_is_a_claim: false` on every
record. And a neighbour: two businesses on one face stand in no order any source supports.

**The refusals are what keep it honest, and they refuse more than they take.** Forty of the
59 are not seated. Twenty-four name a street — Dearborn, La Salle, Canal, North Water — with no roof
whose platted lot faces it, and adopting a roof that shows the street only a corner side would
have put a door where the plat puts a gable end. Nine are a second heading of a house already
seated on that face, because the corpus prints "Peter Cohen" and "Peter Cohen's store" as two
entries and one man did not keep two storefronts on one street on any evidence here. Seven are short
purely of supply. `python3 tools/adopt_street_faces.py --report` prints every refusal with its
reason and its count, so the ratio is auditable rather than asserted.

**AND A ROOF CAN BE REFUSED AS WELL AS A BUSINESS, WHICH IS WHERE THIS ENTRY LOST FIVE OF ITS
TWENTY-FOUR.** The anonymous parcels deal ANCILLARY roofs as well as principal ones — privies,
stables and woodsheds standing behind a lot — and for its first day this pass counted them as free
supply. Nine documented businesses were seated in outbuildings, Peter Cohen among them, in
`recon_1835_blk_south_water_clark_a3_05`, which is a privy. The rule against it was older than the
pass and enforced elsewhere: `tools/generate_block_infill.py` has refused an occupant on an
ancillary roof since the inferred-household programme, because "a yard building serves the lot it
stands behind, and an adoption is a claim about who lived or worked in a building". Trying to spend
the allocation into the structure records is what ran into it (T-0417). Four of the nine took a
principal roof instead — Harmon, Loomis & Co. moved into a narrow two-storey store — and five had
no unspoken-for roof left on their street, so they join the refusals with that reason counted.

**A known residue, stated rather than absorbed.** Four Lake Street entries — Wm. G. Branchaud,
W. G. Blanchard, G. Blanshard and F. G. Blanshard — advertise one trade within five months and
read as one man under four transcribed spellings. The refusal above matches exact surnames and
caught one of the four; the other three take three roofs for what is probably one house. This
pass will not decide by resemblance what the gazetteer's identity layer has not judged, and
**T-0408** is the ticket that judges it from the page images.

**Consequence:** twenty-four businesses the papers name move from a research file into the town's
own street faces, on roofs that were already standing. **No geometry moves, no triangle is added,
and no building changes grade.** What this entry admits is that a visitor standing on South Water
Street in front of Peter Cohen's store is looking at a building we raised and a name the paper
printed, and that nothing joins the two but this rule.

**How to resolve:** a directory, a tax list, or a lot-and-block address in the corpus would put
any of these 19 on a lot, at which point that business leaves this entry for a placement of its
own — the shape **T-0384** through **T-0387** already take for the businesses whose advertisements
name an anchor. A ruling that a corner side is a street face would move up to twenty-four more into
this entry rather than out of it, and the count above is what would change.

reconstructed roofs' own presence and placement) · **L1** · tickets **T-0354** (this), **T-0262**,
**T-0263**, **T-0375**, **T-0338**, **T-0408**, **T-0417** (spent into the roofs, and the yard
refusal).
**Revised:** 2026-08-30 (T-0416) — **a corner side is now a face, on the owner's ruling of
that day, and this entry covers 29 businesses rather than 19.** The paragraph above ends
"a ruling that a corner side is a face would move up to twenty-four more into this entry
rather than out of it", and that is the ruling. It was asked for with a measurement rather
than an argument: the tool deals every reading of "face" out in full, so the question put
to him was "twelve shops on Dearborn, La Salle and Canal" and not "twenty-four eligible".
He took the corner side and DECLINED the centreline band in the same breath — a corner
building genuinely has a door on each of the two streets it meets, and a band is a
distance from a line that says nothing about which way a building looks. **Ten businesses
seated, not twelve**, and the two the measurement over-counted are the correction this
entry has to carry: refusal 5 refused a roof `data/residents/` seats a NAMED household in,
and the inferred-household programme's 101 households are not there under a name, so its
roofs looked free. The first re-derivation put Elmira Fowler's millinery into one and
`tools/inferred_occupancy.py` raised, exactly as it is built to. The refusal now covers
both layers. **This is the second time spending the allocation is what found the error** —
T-0417 was the first, and nine businesses were standing in privies — and the lesson is the
same one: an allocation nothing consumes is an allocation nothing checks. **What is
invented is unchanged and is still only WHICH roof**: no geometry moved, no triangle was
added, no building changed grade, and a corner adoption's card says it took the tier end
rather than the lot front, so a visitor is not told the plat put a door where it did not.
**And the entry's own subject is still not seated:** Wm. Sabine and John Dave want North
Water Street, which has no roof standing on it under any adopted reading, and its one roof
in the declined band is an inferred household's home — so even the band would have seated
neither. Their answer is frontage (**T-0375**), and **T-0416** records that rather than
closing over it.

### L213 — Four people the papers name with no trade are written as households of one, on a residency test
**Decision:** L206 seated the register's `new_resident` people whose TRADE the papers print, and
L207 the names known only from the post office's letter lists. What is left of that half — 386
people named in a proceedings column, a public card, a shipping notice or an advertisement, with
no trade the register can read — have no anchor at all, and a name printed in a Chicago paper is
not a Chicago resident. So on 2026-08-29 they were put to a residency test derived from the corpus
rather than judged one by one, and four passed it: J. K. Boyer, Thomas Hoit, B. S. Morris and
J. W. Fell. `tools/mint_placed_residents.py` derives the set and re-derives it on every commit;
`--report` prints all 382 refusals with their reasons and `--self-test` fires every rule against
the case it exists for.

**What is not invented: the people, and where the papers put them.** Each is named in the Chicago
Democrat or the Chicago American at the issue and column their record cites, and the corpus gives
each a place inside the town and none outside it. They are graded `attested` on that basis and on
nothing else.

**What is invented, and it is only this: that each is a household.** As L206 and L207, and for the
same reason — `data/residents/` has no way to carry a person except inside one. Each record
carries a single member, `lives_at` null, `works_at` null, no origin, no party size, no family,
and `division: unplaced`. Their occupation reads `none_recorded` — the residents vocabulary's own
word for an absent record, already carried by committed people — because the papers give none; the
absence is the finding and not a hole, and it is written as an absence rather than reasoned from
the company they keep.

**The test, stated so it can be argued with.** (a) The corpus must place the person inside the
town — the bare town, a committed 1835 street, a committed structure — and NOWHERE outside it;
fifteen are refused on a place elsewhere (Ottawa, Detroit, Cook county) and thirty-six on no place
at all. (b) A bare "Chicago" is where the papers say somebody did something at Chicago, which is
not the claim that they lived there, so it needs a second witness and only three count: an address
at street level, print in two or more separate issues, or print in the same claim as two or more
people this reconstruction already holds (the register's own `enrich` finding). Fell came in on
the first, Boyer and Hoit the second, Morris the third; twelve reached that question with none of
the three. (c) The name must be found whole in the transcription, outside every uncertainty
bracket and not cut off by one — 176 are refused there, and the rule exists because the first run
of this pass minted "The Blanshard household" out of the letters `fG. BL NSHARD` and "The Dave
household" out of `JOHN DAVE[S?]`. Thirty-six more carry a trade the residents vocabulary has no
word for and are held for a ticket of their own rather than minted trade-less.

**A limit, stated rather than papered over:** the duplicate guards compare surnames exactly, so
'Blanshard' and 'Blanchard', or 'Eldredge' and 'Eldridge', pass each other untouched and may be
one man under two printed spellings. A fuzzy match was rejected for the reason
`compile_register.py` gives for refusing a fuzzy trade match.

**Where this pass stands in the order, because it changes what it can see.** Three passes now mint
residents out of the register and they run in a fixed precedence, best-evidenced first: documented
(a trade the papers print) ▸ placed (this entry) ▸ letter-list-only. Each skips its own output and
every pass below it, so no derivation is changed by anything any of the three mints. Where two
reach for one family name the higher one keeps it; this pass gave way to L206 three times.

**Consequence:** the Evidence panel's people section goes from 201 households and 237 people to
205 and 241, `households_without_a_dwelling` in the town census moves from 80 to 84, and the four
new rows carry the orphan chip that says no building card can reach them. No geometry moves, no
triangle is added and no figure is drawn (L1).

### L214 — Three quarters of this town's people are a name on a post-office list and nothing else
**Scope:** `residents.persons[letter_list_only]` — 727 people
**Decision:** on 2026-08-30 the owner ruled that EVERY name the post office's lists of
uncalled-for letters yield, and the mint's refusals admit, joins the town. 712 names were
minted on that ruling, beside the 15 L207 already held, and the reconstruction went from 244
people in 208 households to 956 in 920. `tools/mint_letter_list_residents.py` derives the whole
set and re-derives it on every commit; `--gate` proves what it is not allowed to do.

**Why this is a liberty and not a dataset growing.** Nothing here is invented and no confidence
was upgraded to allow it: every one of the 727 is printed by name in a list headed as letters
remaining in the Post Office at Chicago and uncalled-for, at the issue and column its own record
cites. The liberty is one of SCALE. About 76 per cent of the people a visitor can open are now
known from that and from nothing else — no trade, no street, no household, no arrival — against
6 per cent the day before. A reader who counts this town's people is counting a post-office list
with a town attached, and no single record says so, because no single record is wrong.

**What each of the 727 may not have, and a gate proves none of them has it.** A letter waiting at
Chicago establishes that a correspondent believed a person of that name reachable here on that
date. It does not establish that they lived here, kept a trade here, or were here on 1 July 1835.
So each is a household of ONE, `division: unplaced`, `lives_at` and `works_at` unattested,
`occupation` recorded as none, `letter_list_only: true`, carrying `letter_list_returns` — the
dated returns behind it — so a name printed on the scene date can be told from one printed
eighteen months earlier. `--gate` refuses a roof, a trade, a second member, a manifest row that
drops the flag and a structure record that names one of them; `--self-test` breaks each of those
seven assertions and requires the gate to fire.

**What the refusals still take, and they are the only thing between a post-office list and this
town's population.** 1,181 of the 1,908 names in the pool are refused, in order: 454 garbled by
the transcription, 310 whose first evidence falls after the scene date, 243 for a surname this
pass had already minted, 128 because the town already names that family, 22 placed where this
project cannot put them, 12 firms, 12 a surname and nothing else. The count moves with the corpus
and `--scale` re-derives it on any tree; what does not move is that a refusal quietly ceasing to
fire is now worth hundreds of records rather than one.

**The limit L207 stated as a footnote, restated as a property of the town.** The Chicago post
office served the country around the town as well as the town, so an uncalled-for letter is
evidence a writer believed the addressee reachable at Chicago and not proof that anyone slept
here. Refusal 6 catches the 22 the corpus places elsewhere by name; it cannot catch a settler the
corpus never places at all. At 15 records that was a caveat on each of them. At 727 it is a
statement about how this town's population was assembled, and this entry is where it is admitted
as one.

**Consequence:** the Evidence panel's people section goes from 208 households and 244 people to
920 and 956. `households_without_a_dwelling` in the town census moves from 87 to 799 and `housed`
does not move at all, because not one of these people is placed anywhere — which is the ruling's
own condition, measured. The section is SPLIT rather than sorted: the 193 households the rest of
the corpus documents keep the list they had, at the length they had, and the 727 sit under them
in one closed group that says what that evidence is worth before it is opened. That is the
ruling's own test of whether it was implemented well — *a visitor who looks at the whole must be
able to tell at a glance which three quarters are names alone.* No geometry moves, no triangle is
added and no figure is drawn (L1).

### L215 — John Holbrook's store: the count of doors is the paper's, the metres between them are ours

**Decision:** the Chicago Democrat of 10 June 1835 and the Chicago American of 13 June 1835 both
carry John Holbrook's card — hats, clothing, boots and shoes, wholesale and retail, "on South-Water
st. one door from Dearborn street" — and neither says one word about the premises. So the ADDRESS is
read and the BUILDING is invented: a 30 by 25 ft one-storey frame shop, seated one door east of the
Chicago American's own office on the block face all three of these addresses share. Its footprint,
its storey count and its clapboard stock are declared here. Two further inventions are declared here
that a footprint entry would not usually carry, because the ordinal reading is what makes them load
bearing:
**THE DOOR-GAP RULE — the metres, which are not evidence.** The owner ruled on 2026-08-30 (T-0384,
`docs/CORNER-ORDINAL.md`) that "one door from Dearborn street" is an ordinal off the corner, and his
ruling says in terms that *the door count is evidence and the metres are not*. This entry owns the
metres. THE RULE: a front placed one door along from a named neighbour is set **3.048 m (10 ft) clear
of that neighbour's wall**, measured along the face. It is a convention with two reasons and no
source: "one door from" describes a neighbouring front and not a party wall, so the gap may not be
zero; and ten feet is the smallest gap that still reads as two buildings rather than one at walking
distance, which is the scale this reconstruction is looked at from. Applied here it puts Holbrook's
west wall at local ENU E 726.30, and every other number in `position.note` follows from it.
**AND THE SIDE OF DEARBORN.** The phrase gives a count and not a direction. East is taken because
the first premises west is a documented dwelling and the second is off the face entirely, and
because read eastward the three addresses this face's own papers print — the American's office at
the corner, Holbrook one door from Dearborn, Frederick Thomas two doors from the American office —
describe a continuous row with no contradiction, and read westward they describe nothing that
closes. That is a reading of three sources against each other, which is why the position is graded
`inferred` rather than `reconstructed`; but the fork is real and it is recorded here as well as on
the record.
**Why:** every dimension of the building is borrowed from its own neighbours rather than found. The
30 ft front is the parcel's small-shop figure and is what fits between the American office's east
wall and the lot line with both margins kept; the 25 ft depth is `chicago_american_office`'s own
committed depth on this same face, taken because Holbrook advertises a large stock replenished every
fifteen or twenty days and a shop taking fortnightly shipments needs a storeroom behind its counter.
One storey is the smaller claim for premises the advertisements describe only as a counter and a
stock. The alternative to inventing them was to leave a documented trade standing nowhere, and a
door the papers themselves say was occupied reading as empty ground.
**Consequence:** a visitor walking South Water Street east of Dearborn sees three shop fronts in a
row where the committed data previously had two and a gap. The row is the point: read eastward the
three printed addresses describe a continuous frontage with no contradiction between them, which is
evidence about the STREET even where it is weak evidence about any one shop. The Evidence panel
grades the footprint and the storey count `reconstructed` and says on each value that it is
borrowed. **No lot is claimed and none is taken**: the record carries a `lot_claim` block declaring
`claims_lot: false`, `tools/plat_occupancy.py` reads it and leaves the plat's entitlements exactly
where they were, and `tools/measure_corner_ordinals.py` fails if any of that stops being true.
**On the clapboard, and on L148, which this does not edit:** the exposed face of this building's
siding is L148's rule applied to a record written after that entry was — `tools/deal_siding_stock.py`
dealt it, keyed to the construction season and advanced so no frame building within 60 m shares it,
and the tool's own note names L148 as the owner of the invention. L148's Decision counts the named
frame buildings it covers, and with this record standing that count is one higher than the number
written there. It is recorded here rather than by correcting that entry, because this document is
append-only and a later count belongs in a later entry.
**How to resolve:** the page images for either printing would settle whether the advertisements carry
a side of the street. A canal-commission lot record or an assessment naming Holbrook would replace
the count of doors with a lot — and would be the thing that lets this record claim one, which today
it may not. Any measured description of the premises would replace the whole of this entry, and a
second ordinal placement anywhere in the corpus would turn the door-gap rule from a convention used
once into a rule that has to be argued.

### L216 — The one lot-and-block address in the corpus is seated on a roof nothing says is that house
**Decision:** where a newspaper prints a LOT AND A BLOCK — the plat's own language, and the
strongest placement statement this corpus makes — the address is seated on the reconstructed
roof already standing on that lot, and the roof gains the address and nothing else. There is
exactly one such address: G. Spring's For-Sale notice, six printings in the *Chicago
Democrat* between 1834-06-18 and 1834-11-19, "LOT No. 7, in block No. 16, one lot east of
Haddock's Tavern, on Lake street … a large Dwelling-House and fine well". `docs/LOT-ADDRESS.md`
is the policy, `data/research/newspapers/lot_addresses.json` the authored address,
`tools/lot_addresses.py --check` the gate that re-derives it on every commit.

**What is not invented:** the address. Four of the six printings carry "lot 7", "block 16",
"Lake street", the neighbouring tavern and the house itself unbroken, and the two that do not
are named in the ledger with what the column edge took from each. Nor is the block number
invented: T-0358 derived it, and it is the one derived number in that file an independent
source agrees with — the notice's own "on Lake street" and the tavern one lot west of it land
on the block the count reaches from the Wright sheet's numeral.

**What is invented, and it is the step from a number to a roof.** Four lots to a block face is
a reading of ONE block; the lot lines that reading divides a block into are the plat module's
and are drawn from no sheet; the counter-clockwise numbering was read off block 18's crop and
applied to every block by counting. So "lot 7" is a conjectural line bearing a documented
number, and the roof whose centroid falls inside it is an anonymous count-unit the 665-roof
programme raised to meet an aggregate — dealt to the D3 family long before this address
resolved to anything. **Nothing says that roof is that house.** Its existence, position,
footprint and every form value are exactly what they were, still conjectural under **L92**,
and the seating is graded at the bottom tier for that reason: `confidence` is `const:
"reconstructed"` in the schema and the gate re-reads the phase and fails if a documented
address has promoted it.

**The source says LARGE and the fabric does not answer to the word.** The roof under this
address is a 5.36 × 6.38 m one-room cottage. That is a real contradiction between a documented
adjective and a reconstructed massing, and it is recorded here rather than repaired, because
repairing it means re-dealing the block's family mix and re-baking, which is a second
demonstration. The card carries the notice's own words, so a visitor reads "a large
Dwelling-House" beside a small one and can see the seam.

**The well is documented and is not drawn.** The notice's second structure is "a fine well".
The town has no well — no archetype, no committed structure, no yard record — so drawing this
one would raise a new kind of object for the whole scene rather than place a known one, and it
would be the only well in Chicago. The absence is stated on the record instead of passed over,
which is the distinction this document exists for: an omission that says so is not the same
liberty as one that does not.

**Three things this deliberately does not claim, and each is a field or a gate.** A person:
the advertiser is who to apply to for terms, `is_the_occupant` and `is_the_owner` are `false`
in the ledger and refused if they are not, and this house is NOT named for G. Spring — the same
man is the attorney the papers put second door west of Franklin and South Water, and **T-0412**
is the same trap read from the other side. A promotion: the phase stays `reconstructed`. And a
second building: an address landing on two roofs, or two addresses landing on one, are both
refusals rather than allocations, because an address that names more than one building has
placed none of them.

**How to resolve:** a canal-commission lot record, a deed or an assessment naming this lot
would replace the conjectural line with a recovered one and would make the seating a reading
rather than an allocation. Thompson's own lot numerals for block 16, read off a sheet, would
do the same for the numbering. A measured description of the house would end the contradiction
between the word LARGE and the massing under it.

### L217 — The Sauganash's second mass: the plate fixes its height and its span, and this fixes how far it runs back

**Decision:** the Sauganash Hotel (`sauganash_hotel`, frame_1831) gains a second two-storey
mass — a cross wing standing back off its own rear wall at the east end, clapboard like the
block, its ridge running away at right angles at the block's own ridge height, two lights in
its far gable and one in the attic above them, and no stack. **One number in that is invented
and it is the only one:** `cross_wing_depth_m`, how far the wing runs back, set at 8.0 m. The
gable lights, their sills and the attic light are the archetype's, as every opening on this
building's wings has been since **L154**.
**Why:** everything else about the wing is measured, and the measurement is arithmetic on a
banked reading rather than a look at a picture. T-0617 put the near apex of Braunhold's plate
at (648, 350) with one line out of it at image slope −0.318 and one at +0.095.
`tools/sauganash_apex_lines.py` projects each onto the vertical through the vanishing point of
the plane it lies in — the plate gives both horizontal vanishing points and, from their
orthogonality, its own focal length — and both come out **horizontal in the world**, 1.35° and
0.11°, where a 38° rake in the same plane would have been drawn at slope −1.99 against the
−0.318 measured. Two ridges, not a ridge and a rake. Two gable ridges of one wall height and
one pitch stand at one height only if they span the same width, so the wing's SPAN is the main
block's own depth and the archetype refuses to build it at any other; `tools/check.sh` gates
on the finding. What no single sheet can give is a DEPTH — `docs/RESEARCH/sauganash_image_accuracy.md`
row 11 says so, and from the plate's station this wing is behind the main block with only its
ridge showing. So 8.0 m is the owner's own reading of the views, *"almost the same size"*,
taken as the block's 8 m depth, which makes the wing square in plan. It was also chosen to
leave the fenced rear yard its Market Street gateway and its three kept trees: nothing about
that yard is attested either, and a wing sized to fill it would be one guess crowding another.
**Consequence:** a visitor at Lake and Market sees the three-part building all three views
draw — the five-bay block on the street, a second mass of the same ridge height running back
behind its east end, and the log cabin at that same end on the street line — where until now
they saw one 12 × 8 m box with a log wing wrongly stood in front of its face. The wing's ridge
height and its span are readings and carry the record's `inferred`; its length is this entry's
and carries `reconstructed`, so the Evidence panel grades the two apart. Nobody can read the
wing's depth off the mesh as evidence. The rear yard's drawn ground is notched around it and
its east elm moved 2.1 m to keep its stated 2.5 m off a fence that also moved.
**How to resolve:** the individual building rectangles on Hathaway 1834 or Wright 1834 at the
Lake and Market corner would give the whole plan at once and end both this entry and the
frontage measurement it stands beside; Andreas vol. 1 p. 106 ("Eagle Exchange"), unread at
page-image level, is the other standing lead; a second view of this building **from a
different station** — every one held is the same composition — would give the depth directly.

### L219 — Sixty-eight roofs are told who entered their ground by a survey grid nobody traced
**Scope:** `structures.land_owner[constructed_section_grid]` — 68 structures
**Decision:** the Public Land Survey section lines of T39N R14E are CONSTRUCTED rather than
traced, and 68 structures carry a `land_owner` block that rests on them. The construction is
one committed control point — `G1` in `data/traces/gcp/wright_1834_gcps.json`, State &
Madison, whose own note has said since the datum work that it is the *PLSS section corner:
sections 9/10/15/16, T39N R14E* — carried on the plat's own east-west bearing, which Lake,
Randolph and Washington agree on to the sixth decimal, in **nominal one-mile squares**. The
quarters and half-quarters an entry like `E2NE` names are that square halved and halved
again. `tools/resolve_land_tracts.py` builds all of it and re-derives it on every
`tools/check.sh`.
**Why:** the Illinois State Archives register describes 375 sales by legal description and
the structures carry footprints, and until T-0609 nothing joined them — so the register could
say who entered the ground under Fort Dearborn and the walkthrough could not. Putting the
description on the ground needs a survey grid, and this project holds no traced one: no
section-line vector, no second corner, no township plat. It holds one corner. Carrying a
nominal mile from it is the same construction, from the same point and the same bearing, that
**L108** already declared for the United States Reservation's south and west boundaries and
**L182** for Madison's centreline — so no new kind of claim is being made about where the
survey ran, only a wider use of the one already on the books.
**What bounds it, and this is the half that matters.** A nominal mile is not a surveyed mile:
a township's north and west tiers absorb its closing error, and with one corner there is
nothing to measure the drift against. So the grid is carried ONLY across the four sections
that meet at that corner — 9, 10, 15 and 16 — and **213 of the 375 sales are recorded as read
and deliberately NOT put on the ground** for being outside them. Inside them each assignment
is graded by its own margin: a footprint more than 40 m inside its tract, twice the working
horizontal uncertainty of anything traced off the 1834 sheets, is `inferred`; one nearer a
tract line than that drops to `reconstructed`, and the metres are printed on the row. **51 of
the 68 stand at the bottom tier**, and mostly not for geometry: 44 of them are roofs a recipe
dealt to a lot, and nothing on an invented structure may outrank the invention that put it
there — the tract is real, but the claim that THIS roof stands on it is the recipe's. Three of
the remaining seven are the fort's own service buildings, added 2026-09-06 by T-0883, and they
are at the bottom tier for the ordinary geometric reason rather than for an invention behind
them: the wash house stands 12.9 m from a tract line and the shop 39.1 m, both inside the 40 m
the middle tier asks for, on the same reservation ring the homestead beside them sits on. Only
17 documented buildings carry the middle tier, the newest of them the fort's two out
buildings, added 2026-09-06 by T-0881 at 81.1 m and 76.4 m from a tract line — the widest
margins on the reservation ring, because they stand the furthest south of anything on it. Two tracts are not grid squares at all
and are not treated as any: Beaubien's south-west fractional quarter of section 10 is the
reservation ring L108 already derives, and Robert A. Kinzie's north fraction is section 10
clipped to the committed north bank of the main stem.
**Consequence:** a visitor who opens the card on Fort Dearborn's barracks now reads *The
ground was entered by John Baptist Baubian, 28 May 1835* with an `inferred` or `reconstructed`
chip beside it and the whole argument behind `why` — including the three things the row does
not claim (that he still held it, that he lived there, that the entry held). 254 structures in
the original town read nothing at all, because the canal commissioners sold those lots and
this register does not hold them, and one house on Monroe Street reads nothing because the
school section's own subdivision plat is not traced here.
**How to resolve:** a traced section line — the GLO township plat of T39N R14E, or a second
committed corner a mile from the first — would replace the nominal mile with a measurement and
lift the whole population a tier, and would also say by how much the construction was wrong.
The School Section Addition's 1833 plat would separately unlock the 150 rows this entry
refuses.

### L220 — 490 people join the town on the town's own lists, and a household is written round each of them

**Scope:** `residents.persons[civic_mint]` — 490 people
**Decision:** on 2026-09-03 the owner ratified a grading ladder for resident evidence,
quoted in full in T-0514 and in `docs/RESEARCH/resident-grading-policy.md`, and T-0513
spent it: `tools/consolidate_resident_evidence.py --build` reads seven source domains,
clusters them into identities and writes `grading_proposal.json`, which says per identity
what the ladder makes of it. That file was a proposal and nothing in it had been written
onto a card. Measured on `dev` before this pass, only 37 of the 85 men on the 1835 poll
list had even a surname in the residents layer. `tools/mint_civic_residents.py` writes the
rest: every identity the ladder grades `attested` or `inferred` that the town did not
already carry, on the evidence of the civic lists, the parish register, the contemporary
press, the two printed directories with the old settlers' death notices, and the 1840
census. 531 of them, in 531 households of one when this liberty was first written; **490
today**, and the figure has moved twice for opposite reasons. T-0839 took it to 489, because
it found that some of those containers held one man twice. T-0724 took it to 490, because the
compound-surname rule stopped reading `H. Van Den Bogart` and `Dr Henry Van der Bogart` as one
`bogart` — a merge nobody had ruled on, made by taking the last token of a printed name — and
the town gained the card it had been folding away. Whether those two are one man is a reading
somebody owes the page; it is filed as T-0842 and is not assumed here in either direction. The pass
minted a card for every identity the ladder graded and the town did not already carry, and
its test for "already carry" was the name as the source printed it — so Gurdon Saltonstall
Hubbard, who is printed G., G. S., Gurdon S., Gordon S. and G. T., was minted five times
beside the card the town had for him. 42 of the containers were folded onto the person they
named on 2026-09-05, under written rulings in `data/residents/card_merge_rulings.json`;
none was deleted, each is kept whole under `data/residents/merged/` and redirected by
`index.json`'s `merged` table, and the sources they carried are on the survivor. The number
this liberty declares is the number of containers standing, and it will fall again as the
remaining rulings are made.

**The 532nd, and why every other figure below still says 531.** The 531 were minted in one
pass on 2026-09-03 and every count in this entry is a count about that pass, left as it
stands. On 2026-09-05 T-0724 taught the splitter that a compound surname is one surname,
which parted `H. Van Den Bogart` from `Dr Henry Van der Bogart` — two printings the
consolidation had been holding as one man only because both truncated to the surname
`Bogart`, a merge nobody ever ruled on. The minting pass then wrote a household round the
one it had never seen standing on its own. Whether the two are the same man is a reading
somebody owes the page, and it is T-0842's; the liberty here is unchanged in kind and one
larger in size.

**Why this is a liberty and not a dataset growing.** Nothing here is invented and no
confidence was upgraded to allow it: every one of them is named in a record this project
has transcribed, and the person carries that reading AS READ, with its locator, its record
id, its source and the ladder rule that fired, in `civic_evidence[]`, `church_evidence[]`,
`press_evidence[]`, `book_evidence[]` or `census_evidence[]`. The liberty is the same one
L207, L213 and L214 record and it is the only way this dataset can carry a person at all:
**that each of them is a HOUSEHOLD.** One member, `division: unplaced`, `lives_at` and
`works_at` unattested, `occupation` recorded as none, no origin, no party, no family, no
figure drawn (L1). A reader who counts this town's households is counting 490 containers
that were written to hold a name, and no single record says so, because no single record
is wrong.

**What the arrival claims, and what it refuses to.** `arrival` is a BOUND, written
`not_later_than` the earliest record inside the scene year that names the person, at that
record's own precision — a full date where a paper gives one, the year's end where a list
gives only a year. For 99 of the 531 that bound falls after 1 July 1835, because the
earliest source naming them is later than the day this scene models; the validator warns
that the bound straddles the scene date, the note says so in words, and
`present_on_scene_date` is `uncertain` for exactly those people. `present` is written only
where the record BRACKETS the day — the person is named at Chicago at or before 1 July 1835
and named again at or after it.

**What the refusals take, and they are what stands between a transcription and this town's
population.** 6,155 of the 6,686 identities the proposal offers are refused, in order: 4,256
the ladder does not reach at all (an 1839 directory or an 1840 census appearance alone is
never an 1835 resident), 949 whose only scene-year source is a post-office letter list —
the pool of the pass beside this one, `tools/mint_letter_list_residents.py`, which the
owner's ruling of 2026-08-30 already settled — 828 the town already carries, 110 resting on
the 1832 Black Hawk War enrollment alone, 7 whose id is a person's already, 3 the project
has researched and left OUT in `index.json`'s `researched_not_resident`, and 2 firms. The
counts move with the corpus; `--report` re-derives them on any tree.

**The 1832 muster refusal, and why it is written down here.** The enrollment record states
its own ladder — *"An 1832 enrollment is EARLIER evidence and never an 1835 residence on its
own: it places the man in this town in 1832, which is why it dates and corroborates rather
than mints"* — and this pass does not overturn a reading the project has already made from a
rung the consolidation assigns generically. It also keeps the pass away from the 94 rows the
index prints in the INDIAN company with no surname comma at all: those names cannot be read
in a surname-first model without inventing an order for them, and any record touching the
removal is subject to AGENTS.md's standing constraint rather than to a mint tool's judgement.

**The tension with L213, stated rather than buried.** `tools/mint_placed_residents.py` put
the register's tradeless people through a residency test derived from the corpus and refused
382 of them, on the reasoning that *a name printed in a Chicago paper is not a Chicago
resident*. The owner's ladder, ratified a fortnight later, reads the same evidence
differently at rung G1b, and 315 of the 531 minted here are minted on it. This pass applies
the ladder because the ladder is the ratified rule and T-0514 is the instruction to spend
it; the disagreement is not resolved by this entry, it is recorded by it, and the two tests
are both still in the tree and both still gated.

**What the new anchors cost downstream, measured.** The directory crosswalks match a later
entry to a resident on surname plus the FIRST INITIAL of the given name — their own
documented rule, which refuses a surname-only agreement and states its reasoning on every
match. 531 new surnames give that rule more to bind to: it declared 35 merges onto people minted
here, and 23 of those agree on the initial while the full forenames behind it differ — some a
spelling (Absalom against Absolom), some plainly two people (Thomas L. Abbott onto Titus H.
Abbott; Michael onto Mary Hogan). Nothing is hidden by that —
each card shows the entry AS READ, so the discrepancy is on the page rather than under it —
but the rule is looser than it was worth being when the town held 848 names, and T-0667
carries the finding.

**Consequence:** the town goes from 848 households and 872 people to 1,380 and 1,404;
`attested` from 141 to 482 and `inferred` from 731 to 922 — the extra four beyond this pass's
own 531 are what the passes beside it reach once the register is recompiled against a larger
town. `data/residents/` grows from 7.2 MB to 13 MB on disk (2.7 MB of new records over 531 new
files) and `index.json` from 318 KB to 510 KB. No geometry moves, no triangle is added,
and not one of the 531 is placed anywhere: `housed` in the town census does not move at all,
which is the ruling's own condition, measured.

### L221 — What the 1835 town may show of the Indian trade: a catalogue of about 130 articles is admitted as corroboration and refused as a warrant
**Decision:** the American Fur Company's own list of the goods it furnished "for trade of the
Chicago country" — filed verbatim as `bk_afc_018` in
`data/research/books/claims/american_fur_company_hurlbut.json`, roughly 130 named articles from
arm bands and blankets through northwest guns and scalping knives to vermillion, wampum and
whiskey — **licenses nothing to be added to this town**. It may CORROBORATE a word that already
stands on some other ground. It may not WARRANT a new object, a new letter or a new signboard.
Nothing in `data/` was added, moved or relettered on the strength of it, and the audit below is
the whole of what it did change: five commodity words that stood on a generator's feel now stand
on a citation.

**Why the restraint, in three counts, and the third is the one that decides it.**
1. **It is about 1828, not 1835.** Hurlbut printed the catalogue in 1881 and called it
   "fifty-three years ago"; the arithmetic is this project's and he may have drafted the essay
   earlier. Between that year and the scene date lie the 1833 Treaty of Chicago and a removal
   that ran through the summer the scene is set in. A stock list is the most perishable kind of
   evidence a trade leaves — it is what was in the store that season.
2. **It is a district, not a shop.** "The Chicago country" is the outfit's whole ground of
   distribution, supplied through Chicago rather than sold across a counter on South Water
   Street. Nothing in the list is placed at an address, and this project's rule for goods is that
   the FACT is one question and WHICH FRONTAGE is another (`data/yard/town_trade_goods.json` §
   `existence`). The catalogue answers neither half here: it does not say a Chicago shop held
   these things in 1835, and it names no shop at all.
3. **The company was gone and the trade was small.** `bk_afc_005`: in 1828 Gurdon S. Hubbard
   bought the American Fur Company's entire Illinois interest, seven years before the scene, so
   whatever trade apparatus stands here in 1835 is a private business and not an outpost of a New
   York corporation. `bk_afc_013`: Astor sold out in 1834. And the size argument arrives twice
   from two mouths — `bk_afc_003`, Hurlbut: Chicago was "the port and point of a very limited
   district of distribution"; `bk_afc_012`, **Hubbard himself**, the man best placed to overstate
   it: "this place never had been preeminent as a trading-post, as this was not the Indian
   hunting-ground." The best-informed witness this project holds says the thing was never much.

**The three tests, and they are cumulative.** Before any object, mark or board in this town may
name, depict or imply the Indian trade it must pass all three:
- **AT CHICAGO.** A source that puts the goods in this town, at an address or at a named
  business. "The Chicago country" does not pass. A district-wide outfit list does not pass.
- **AT THE SCENE DATE.** A source that reaches 1835, or a documented business standing on
  1 July 1835 whose own attested description carries the trade. 1828 does not pass on its own.
- **NO PERSON, NAMED OR DRAWN.** AGENTS.md § *Standing constraint — 1835 and Indigenous history*
  governs, and it is not relaxed by a barrel or a signboard. The removal of the Potawatomi is
  the most historically significant event of the target year and requires consultation, not
  inference. **L1** already refuses every human figure; this refuses the trade's iconography as
  well — nothing in this town letters, models or pictures the people the trade was with.

**Does the town show LESS after this? The audit says there is nothing to take away, and that is
the honest answer rather than a comfortable one.** Every asset that could carry the trade was
listed and checked. What was found:

- **34 business signboards** (`data/signage/town_business_signboards.json`, 8 further frontages
  refused a board in writing). **Not one board in this town letters the Indian trade, a fur, a
  pelt or the American Fur Company.** The one that could have — `robert_kinzie_store`, whose
  keeper Andreas lists under "Indian Traders" and whose storehouse chicagology has "dealing in
  groceries and Indian goods" — reads **R. A. KINZIE / Dry Goods & Groceries**, and its own
  `sign_text_from` states the reason in as many words: the record "will not stand behind" the
  Indian trade at the scene date. That decision was taken before this ruling existed and it is
  what this ruling would have required. It stands, sourced.
- **155 marked casks and cases at 27 trading frontages** (`data/yard/town_trade_goods.json`, 106
  barrels and 49 crates, 102 commodity stencils, 26 house brands, 27 shipping marks — L166 is the
  fence the words live inside). **Six of the 155 stand at the town's one trading house**,
  `jb_beaubien_homestead`, and they carry FLOUR, SALT, POWDER, TOBACCO, the case word HARDWARE
  and the house's own brand. **POWDER, TOBACCO and HARDWARE appear nowhere else in the town.**
- **Nothing else exists to audit, and the absence is the finding.** No pack, bale, peltry, fur
  press, canoe cargo, trade blanket, capote, wampum, gorget, arm band, ear bob, looking glass,
  vermillion pot, northwest gun, scalping knife or tomahawk is drawn, lettered or recorded
  anywhere in `data/` outside the research corpus. No warehouse frontage is attributed to the fur
  trade. `robert_kinzie_store`'s own record says it "models a standing store and makes no claim
  about what was on its shelves." **The town shows no Indian-trade apparatus at all**, so the
  answer to *should it show less* is that it already shows none, and the size argument at
  `bk_afc_003` and `bk_afc_012` is satisfied by a town that never built the thing.

**The one thing the catalogue did change, and it is evidence rather than geometry.** The trading
class's four stencil words were chosen by feel. `tools/generate_yard_goods.py` said so:
*"Kept to the provisions and the two dry stores every frontier counter held"* — a period
plausibility argument with no source under it, which L166's own fence (*"a commodity word out of
the trade's OWN attested description"*) could not actually meet for this one frontage, because
Beaubien's trading house has no attested description of its stock. It has one now. **All five
words are in the company's own book for this country**: *flour*, *barrel salt*, *gunpowder*,
*tobacco*, and for HARDWARE the *half axes*, *covered copper kettles*, *nails*, *fine steels*,
*gun flints*, *kettle chains*, *pen knives* and *stirrup irons* the list itemises. So the words do
not move; the reason under them does, from a guess about frontier counters to a citation of
`bk_afc_018`, and both the generator and the record now say which. **This is corroboration
working in the only direction it is allowed to work** — it justified nothing new and it improved
the standing of something already there.

**What is still invented, plainly, and this ruling does not launder it.** That Beaubien's
trading house had anything at all standing outside its door on 1 July 1835; that any of those six
objects was marked; which of the five words landed on which cask; and that the trade class is
`inferred` at all — Andreas has Beaubien building a new residence and a small trading post
alongside the old factory building, which is where `dwelling_and_trading_house` comes from. The
catalogue is 1828 evidence for a WORD, never for a BARREL. The whole layer is still taken away at
`reconstructed` in the confidence view.

**One appearance of the company's name, audited and kept.** `bk_afc_005`'s note argues that "the
words 'American Fur Company' should not appear anywhere in the 1835 scene". They appear once: as
an `aka` on `jb_beaubien_homestead`, *"the American Fur Company factory building"*, which the
popup prints under the building's name as **also**. It is kept, and here is the distinction that
keeps it. Andreas documents it as the building's ORIGIN — the factory building erected by Capt.
Bradley and bought by Jean Baptiste Beaubien in 1817 — so it is a sourced statement about a
structure's past standing in a research card, not a lettered claim that a New York corporation
traded on that ground in 1835. **What is refused is the name on a board, a cask, a card's trade
line or a label.** An origin a source states may be read; a business the sources deny may not be
implied.

**What would move any of this.** The Michilimackinac or Illinois outfit's own books for a year
near 1835 rather than 1828; Hubbard's accounts after he bought the Illinois interest; a Chicago
merchant's day-book, invoice or insurance description naming stock at an address; the Chicago
Democrat's advertising columns read for a trader's own advertisement; or an Indian Department
licence or annuity account naming goods delivered at Chicago in 1834–1835. Any of those would
pass tests one and two. **Test three is not a research gap and does not move on evidence** — it
moves on consultation, per AGENTS.md.

### L222 — A documented address re-deals the family under it: the one lot-and-block notice says LARGE, and the town's first H1 answers the word
**Decision:** the anonymous count-unit seated by the town's one lot-and-block address is
**re-dealt out of the D3 one-room cottage band and into H1, "Larger one-and-a-half-story
house"**, because the source that fixes the address also describes the building on the lot and
this project's roof contradicted it. G. Spring's For-Sale notice — six printings in the
*Chicago Democrat* between 1834-06-18 and 1834-11-19, four of them legible whole — reads "LOT
No. 7, in block No. 16, one lot east of Haddock's Tavern, on Lake street … There is on said lot
a large **Dwelling-House** and fine well". **L216** seated that address on
`recon_1835_blk_south_water_dearborn_d3_03`, a 5.36 × 6.38 m one-room frame cottage — the
smallest dwelling family the 665-roof programme deals — and said in as many words that the
contradiction was recorded rather than repaired because repairing it was a second
demonstration with a bake behind it. **This is that demonstration, and it supersedes L216's
fourth paragraph and nothing else in it.** The roof is now
`recon_1835_blk_south_water_dearborn_h1_03`, 8.03 × 9.96 m, one and a half storeys.

**What is invented is unchanged, and so is the grade.** That any building stood on this ground,
that this count-unit is the house the notice advertises, and every dimension of it are
conjectural exactly as they were under **L92**: "lot 7" is a conjectural line bearing a
documented number, four lots to a block face is a reading of one block, and the
counter-clockwise numbering was read off block 18 and counted outward. The seating stays at the
bottom tier — `confidence` is `const: "reconstructed"` in the schema and
`tools/lot_addresses.py --check` re-reads the phase and fails if a documented address has
promoted the roof it lands on. **What changed is only which invention stands there**: one
bounded by the source instead of one contradicting it.

**Why H1 and nothing above it.** The band is chosen by the lowest rung that answers the
notice's own two words. `data/reconstruction/1835_family_archetype_crosswalk.json` labels D6
and every D family below it a *cottage* and D7 a *Small* two-storey house; H1 is the first the
crosswalk itself calls **larger** and calls a **house**, at 24×30–28×38 ft against the D3
band's 16×20–18×24. The notice says large and says nothing about storeys, paint, trade or
wealth, so nothing above H1 — not H2's merchant house, not H3's boarding house — may be read
out of it. Taking the lowest rung that answers the adjective is the restraint that keeps this
from being a licence to build the best house a word will bear.

**No total moves, and this is a re-deal rather than an overspend.** The 665-roof programme
apportions H1's eighteen roofs to the DISTRICTS and not to any block — "a per-unit family mix
is an apportionment of that district's remainder, not a claim about any block" — so the south
district's remainder held eight unbuilt H1 before this run and holds seven after it, with the
displaced D3 going back the other way, thirteen to fourteen. The block still builds six roofs,
five principal and one ancillary, against the same headroom of six, on the same lots. The
argument is T-0102's and **L143**'s, made again on different evidence.
`tools/reconcile_665.py` re-derives it and `tools/check.sh` runs that derivation.

**The household is not re-homed and no person is claimed.** The inferred carpenter's household
`hh_inf_carpenter_south_17` lived on this roof before the re-deal and lives on it after; the
occupancy note is the one the inferred-household programme wrote, no name is claimed and no
figure is drawn. Nor does the re-deal seat the advertiser: `is_the_occupant` and `is_the_owner`
stay `false` in the ledger, and this is still not "G. Spring's house" — **L216**'s third
refusal is untouched.

**The town's first H1 is this one.** The family was dealt eighteen roofs in July 1835 and
instantiated none of them, so the first larger house this reconstruction raises stands where a
documented notice says a large dwelling-house stood. That is the argument for spending the slot
here rather than anywhere else the schedule could have put it.

**What this does NOT rule.** It does not license an address to move, resize by hand, re-form,
promote or people the roof it lands on — `docs/LOT-ADDRESS.md`'s four refusals stand and are
assertions in `tools/lot_addresses.py --self-test`, and the family band is the ONLY thing a
source's description may reach. The well is still not drawn (**L216**, T-0592). And the rule is
written into `docs/LOT-ADDRESS.md` § *When the notice describes the building* so the next
lot-and-block address inherits it rather than re-arguing it.

**How to resolve:** a deed, an assessment or a canal-commission record naming lot 7 of block 16
would replace the conjectural line with a recovered one; a measured description of the house
would replace the band with a dimension and end the reliance on an adjective altogether.

### L223 — Seven houses stand on a street a directory printed eight years after 1835
**Scope:** `residence_back_projection.positions[placed]` — 7 households
**Decision:** where no source of the scene year says where a person's house stood, a
**street** printed as that person's residence — the volume's own `res` or `bds` — in
Fergus's Chicago directory of 1839 or 1843 may be read backwards and carried as the
household's street **face**. The placement is graded `reconstructed`, the note says how
many years it was carried, and the policy is `docs/RESIDENCE-BACK-PROJECTION.md`.
**Why:** this is L218's mechanism aimed at the other question, and `docs/ADDRESS-BACK-
PROJECTION.md` clause 2 refused it by name so that it would be argued rather than
absorbed. The argument is that a home is not a shop in two places. A residence needs **no
attested trade**, where a business does — everybody the town holds lived somewhere in it,
so an absent occupation says nothing about whether a man had a house — and that departure
is most of the yield: 44 of the 48 residence addresses on the layer belong to people the
1835 papers give no trade, and five of these seven placements are such people. Against
that, a home is carried on a **weaker** argument than a shop: a shopfront is capital sunk
into one street's trade and a lodging is a month's rent.
**Consequence:** seven households stand on a face on the authority of a volume printed
four or eight years after the scene. Twenty of 825 households carried a real `lives_at`
before this pass and twenty carry one after — the faces are text on a card and not a
placement of anybody in the town.
**What is NOT claimed, and this is the load-bearing half:** no lot, no roof, no door
count, **no `lives_at`**, and — unlike L218 — **no point, ever**, not even where the
volume prints a corner. Every residence entry that prints one prints it against a street
NUMBER from a grid Chicago did not have in 1835, so the corner is how an 1843 volume tells
its reader which of two hundred Clark Street doors it means, and reading it back would be
reading a finding aid as a survey. The 41 refusals are on the record beside the seven, so
the arithmetic is visible and not just the successes.
**Where it reaches a reader:** the Evidence panel's household card, as text. Nothing is
drawn — the same admission **L2** makes for the fauna layer.
**How to resolve:** a source inside the scene year that says where somebody slept. The
1835 poll and tax lists are closer to 1835 than a directory is, and any one of them that
houses one of these seven supersedes this entry under the policy's clause R3 without an
argument.

### L224 — A house the paper measured, on a corner the paper did not
**Decision:** `lasalle_lake_house` — the 16-by-30-foot dwelling the *Chicago Democrat*
offered for sale on the corner of LaSalle and Lake — stands on the **north-east** quarter of
that crossing, on the Lake Street frontage of `blk_south_water_lasalle` lot 1, with one
storey, a hall-and-parlour plan, three bays, one chimney, a 40-degree gable, a 2.75 m eave
and no paint. Every one of those is invented. **Its footprint is not**, and that is the
whole point of the record: 9.144 × 4.8768 m is 30 × 16 ft exactly, printed, and it is graded
`attested` while everything around it is graded down.
**Why:** L36's *How to resolve* has been asking for this for a month — "the route left is a
to-let or an insurance notice in an issue still unread" giving a dimension for a building on
these blocks. This is that notice, and it is for a house rather than a store, so it does not
resolve L36; it stands beside it as the first Chicago dwelling in this dataset whose plan
came off a page instead of out of an archetype. **The corner is the price.** The notice names
the crossing and no side, exactly as Andreas names Lake and LaSalle and no side for
`old_bank_building`, so the quarter is a one-in-four choice and the four candidates are about
40 m apart — twice the georeference's own error. The quarter was chosen on **ground**: three
of the four corner lots already carry committed roofs (`old_bank_building` and
`recon_1835_south_d4_009` south-east, `inf_teamster_dwelling_south` and two anonymous roofs
south-west, `recon_1835_blk_south_water_wells_d3_04` north-west) and the north-east is the
one free lot the 665-roof programme records for its block, so building there displaces
nothing. That is a production reason and it buys no confidence.
**Consequence:** a visitor stands at a crossing where the building on one corner is the right
size and on the wrong corner, and the confidence view says so — the footprint chip reads
attested, the position chip reads reconstructed, and the two disagreeing on one building is
the honest picture. **The orientation is the second invention and it is separately stated:**
which of 16 and 30 feet runs along Lake is not printed, and `form.gable_orientation` carries
the reading (30 ft of front on Lake, single-pile 16 ft depth, eaves-front as the 1835 form)
as a `record_only` value rather than as a silence in the polygon.
**What is NOT claimed:** no occupant, no owner and no household. P. Pruyne signs the notice as
its **vendor**, and T-0412's rule is that a vendor's for-sale notice places the seller
nowhere; he is not carried into this building in any field, and the house stands empty rather
than be dealt a family.
**How to resolve:** any printing naming the side of either street settles the position outright
and the move costs nothing. The 1834-35 town lot records for blocks 16 and 17 of the Original
Town, or a deed following the June 1834 sale, would settle the corner and give the house an
occupant at the same time.

### L225 — The word the draughtsman thought worth writing is the one thing on this barn the model does not build
**Decision:** `fort_dearborn_big_barn` stands west and a little south of Fort Dearborn with a
plain gable roof. The plan that puts it there letters it **"Big Barn with Cupola"**, and the
cupola is **not built**. The record carries it as `form.cupola`, graded `attested` — a source
states it in so many words — with `geometry: "absent"` beside the value, so the omission is on
the building's own card rather than in a reviewer's head.
**Why:** the `outbuilding` archetype has no cupola and cannot acquire one cheaply. A cupola is
a size, a set of louvres or lights, a roof of its own and a station along a ridge, and this
building's ridge runs at a pitch that is itself inferred from period practice rather than
measured off anything. That is four inventions stacked on an inference in order to render one
word. The barn is honest with a plain gable and a record that says what is missing; it would be
dishonest with a cupola this project designed.
**Consequence:** a visitor sees a large log barn beside the garrison garden and does not see the
one feature that made an 1830 engineer bother to name it. The `Evidence` panel says so. Anyone
who later gives this archetype a cupola should come back here first — the parameters wanted are
in this entry, not in the mesh.
**What is NOT claimed:** nothing about the cupola's form. Its size, its glazing, its louvring
and where it sat on the ridge are all unstated by both witnesses and are unstated here. A
second plan of this fort, a post return, or the return of Harrison's 1830 original — what is
readable today is Andreas's 1884 re-engraving of it — would replace this entry with geometry.

### L226 — Two buildings the fort's engineer named, and nothing else on earth describes
**Decision:** `fort_dearborn_wash_house` and `fort_dearborn_shop` stand east and south-east of
Fort Dearborn's pickets. **Where they stand and how big they are is read off a plan. What they
are made of, how high they are, what shape their roofs are and where their doors are is
invented**, and every one of those attributes is graded `reconstructed` on both records, so a
visitor turning the reconstructed tier off sees the two buildings' fabric go with it. The same
grade covers **`fort_dearborn_big_barn.barn_1830.form.loft`** — a hay loft nobody attests, on a
barn two witnesses do. And the wash house carries a **`ground_contact: approach_not_modelled`**
declaration: one corner of it stands 0.45 m clear of the modelled terrain.
**Why:** the Harrison plan of 1830 is a plan. It letters *Wash house* and *Shop* against two
drawn buildings and it says nothing about either one's elevation, because no plan does. Gurdon
Hubbard corroborates the wash house's class, its side of the fort and what was done in it —
*"rude wash-houses … in which the men and women of the garrison conducted their laundry
operations"* — and gives it one adjective, `rude`, which is not a material. He does not mention
the shop at all. So there are two buildings whose position this project can defend to a few
metres and whose walls it cannot defend at all, and the alternative to inventing the walls was
leaving two named buildings off the model for a fifth year. `RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER, NOT A
FAILURE` (AGENTS.md) is the ruling that says build them and grade them down.
**What was invented, item by item.** The wash house: `plank` construction (reasoned from `rude`
and from a wet trade wanting air through its walls, which is reasoning and not evidence), a
shed roof at 20 degrees, a 2.3 m eave, a man door, and which wall it is in. The shop: `log`
construction, a gable at 34 degrees, a 3.0 m eave, a man door, its side, and no paint. Every
figure is the `outbuilding` archetype's own size-aware default or the 34 degrees every other
Fort Dearborn record here carries; none of them is a reading.
**Consequence:** a visitor walking east out of the fort's south gate meets two small working
buildings on ground that was empty, and the confidence view tells them the difference between
the two claims being made — the footprint chips read `inferred`, the wall chips read
`reconstructed`. At the wash house they also meet a 45 cm step they cannot take, because the
building sits on the shoulder where the ground begins to fall to the beach and nothing in this
model builds the sill, blocks or bank of sand that would have met it there.
**What is NOT claimed:** which trade the shop was. A post of this size kept a smith and usually
a carpenter and it would cost nothing to write one in; neither is written, because the plate
says *Shop*. Nor is the wash house claimed to be the only one — Hubbard says wash-houses,
plural, and one is drawn, and the record carries the disagreement rather than resolving it.

### L227 — One water cart, at the one point in the sentence that carries a location
**Decision:** `data/yard/town_water_cart.json` stands **one** two-wheeled cart with a
hogshead mounted at local east 1220.0, north -262.4 — the foot of Randolph Street — facing
the water on Randolph's own bearing, unhitched, unmanned and unmarked. That a cart stood
there on 1835-07-01, whose it was, and what the cart and the cask looked like are all
invented. **What is not invented is that the trade existed and where it went to the water:**
Andreas's Water Works section (`town_findings_andreas_v1#c013`) describes the vehicle —
*"two wheeled vehicles, upon which hogsheads were mounted"* — and names the place, *"having
driven into the lake, generally at the foot of Randolph Street"*, and brackets the era at
both ends off the same page, the town's one public well of 10 November 1834 (`#c012`) and
the Chicago Hydraulic Company, not chartered until 18 January 1836 (`#c014`). July 1835 sits
inside it.
**Why:** `docs/RESEARCH/wells.md` closed the well question by finding that this town's
documented answer to water was not a well but a cart, and left the cart undrawn as its own
demonstration. The position is **derived, not chosen**: the committed `randolph` centreline,
extended on its own bearing, crosses the committed heightfield's z = 0 waterline at east
1224.1 and the traced 1834 shoreline at east 1223.0 — two independently committed surfaces
agreeing to 1.1 m — and the cart stands 4.1 m back from that line so its shaft tips lie on
the wet sand. The bank falls about 1 in 7.3 over the 19 m above the waterline, which is a
slope a cart can be driven down; that is a check on the reading, not an argument for it.
**Consequence:** the town gains the object its own water supply ran on, at the one point in
the whole sentence that carries a location, and gains nothing else. **The count is the
liberty.** The source is plural about the men — *"the watermen"*, *"private enterprise"*,
*"according to competition"* — so more than one cart worked this town and how many is
unknown. One is drawn because the PLACE is drawn once; it is not a statement that the trade
had one cart, and the record says so in `rule.count`.
**What is NOT claimed, and this is most of the entry:** no second cart · no cart or barrel on
any street of the town, because *"their journeys around town"* names no street, no route and
no hour · **no barrel at any customer's door**, though the sentence attests the fixture
plainly, because it identifies not one door and there is no aggregate to deal from — no
ordinance requires a water barrel, no assessment lists one, and five to ten cents the barrel
says the customers were some households and not all of them, so a barrel dealt to every door
would misdescribe a paid trade as a public utility · no waterman, no team, no pail and no
leathern hose (**L1**) · and no worn cart track, because a track is terrain and the committed
heightfield is derived and gated, and cutting ruts into it to illustrate a sentence would put
an invention inside a surface whose whole value is that it is not invented.
**And the model contradicts the source about the water itself, which is recorded here rather
than resolved:** Andreas says *the lake*, and on this project's committed 1834 surfaces the
water at the foot of Randolph is not the lake — land runs to east 1224, water from there to
about 1305, the **sand bar** stands dry at about +1.23 m from 1320 to 1470, and the open lake
begins only beyond east 1478, 254 m further out. So the cart stands at the old southward
channel behind the bar: the river-fed water the same sentence has the settlers turning away
from. Three readings are open — that *"the lake"* is loose for the water at the end of
Randolph, that the old channel was closed or fordable by July 1835 (Wright draws it
narrowing and nothing in this repository dates it), or that the carts crossed the bar and the
street name marks where they left the town. The record picks none.
**How to resolve:** a dated account of the old southward channel's state in 1835 settles the
water. A city or county record of licensed watermen, or a newspaper advertisement for one,
would give the trade a count, a name and possibly a stand — and would turn the cart from
`reconstructed` into something argued.

### L228 — A plural label, two drawn blocks, and everything above the ground invented
**Decision:** `fort_dearborn_out_building_a` and `fort_dearborn_out_building_b` stand about
160 m south of Fort Dearborn's pickets, where the 1830 Harrison plan letters **Out Buildings**
against a pair of solid blocks. **Where they stand, how big they are and how they are turned is
read off the plate. What they are made of, how high they are, what shape their roofs are and
where their doors are is invented**, and every one of those attributes is graded
`reconstructed` on both records, so a visitor turning the reconstructed tier off sees both
buildings' fabric go with it.
**Why:** T-0881 was opened believing this was the wash house's problem in reverse — *a plural
label the plate draws once*. Measured, it is not: the label is plural and the plate draws TWO
blocks, 224 px and 69 px of solid ink, 7.0 m apart, with the outer fence line running between
them. So there are two buildings whose position this project can defend to a few metres and
whose walls it cannot defend at all, on ONE witness rather than the wash house's two — Hubbard
describes the fort's well and its wash-houses and never mentions out buildings. The alternative
to inventing the walls was leaving a labelled pair off the model for a fifth year.
`RECONSTRUCTED IS A TIER, NOT A FAILURE` (AGENTS.md) is the ruling that says build them and
grade them down; this entry is the price of it, and the price is higher here than at L226
because there is no second witness to check the first against.
**What was invented, item by item.** Both buildings: `log` construction, a roof, its pitch, an
eave height, a man door, which wall the door is in, and no paint. (a) carries a gable at 32
degrees on a 2.4 m eave; (b) a shed at 20 degrees on a 2.1 m eave. Every figure is the
`outbuilding` archetype's own size-aware default. None of them is a reading, and `log` in
particular is recorded as INVENTED rather than as an inference from the garrison's practice —
the wash house next door earns `plank` from Hubbard's word *rude*, and there is no equivalent
word here.
**What is measured and is NOT invented:** the two centres, the two sizes and the two bearings,
all of them second moments of the drawn ink after a 3 x 3 erosion that deletes the fence line
crossing both blocks. The method is on the records because an eye-read bounding box would have
carried the fence into the building.
**Consequence:** a visitor walking south from the fort's gate meets two small log buildings on
ground that was empty, the larger with a gable and the smaller barely bigger than a privy. The
confidence view tells them the difference between the two claims: the footprint chips read
`inferred`, every wall chip reads `reconstructed`.
**What is NOT claimed:** what either building was for. `Out Buildings` names what a building is
not — not the barn, not the shop, not the wash house, all three of which this same plate letters
separately — and a post's out buildings are privies, wood sheds, stores and pens. Nor is it
claimed which of the pair stood inside the outer fence and which outside: the drawn line is two
to three pixels wide, which is a metre on the ground at this scale, and both blocks touch it.
Nor is the pair claimed to be all of them — the label is plural over two, and a third that the
engraver did not draw would not be visible to this reading.
