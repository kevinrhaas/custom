# The 1835 reconstruction plan — how the four bands come together

**Owner direction, 2026-09-17.** After the research spend is confirmed, analyse the known
population, reconstruct the missing residents and households, finish and reconstruct the
businesses, then build every missing structure so that *"every person in Chicago has a place to
live and a place to work"* — every invented element marked `reconstructed` with the reason, so a
later attested or inferred finding can replace it. This page is the map of the tickets that do
it; the tickets are the contract. Order is `tickets/QUEUE.md`; nothing here re-ranks it.

## The three files everything converges on

| file | written by | read by |
|---|---|---|
| `data/reconstruction/1835_reconstruction_order_book.json` | T-1166; filled by every reconstruction tool | every band; the "Reconstructing the town" card |
| `data/reconstruction/1835_placement_policy.json` | T-1195 | seating, building, fabric, frontage and yard tickets; the face/end/fabric gates |
| `data/reconstruction/1835_address_book.json` | T-1198, T-1199 | the build tickets; "Go to" on every card |

## The rules that do not move

- **Three tiers, per attribute** (T-1158): `attested` cites a source; `inferred` reasons from
  evidence about this thing; `reconstructed` is invented within a stated model, carries a
  `basis`, a `seed` and a `replaceable_by`, and is recorded in `docs/LIBERTIES.md`. Nothing is
  promoted. A null is `unknown`, never `reconstructed`.
- **The order book is the quota.** A reconstruction tool fills a bucket through its own
  `--build` and cannot overfill it; two builds are byte-identical.
- **Real names before invented ones** (T-1159, T-1172): every name the corpus printed
  and withheld is offered first, under its own read name, with its evidence limit.
- **The standing constraint, as re-ruled 2026-09-17** (AGENTS.md): Native and Métis people,
  households, businesses and camps ARE reconstructed, evidence-bounded, only through T-1177,
  every record `review_required` + `touches_removal`, review by Native scholars still sought
  before release; Black residents, families and Black-owned businesses are identified on a
  `community` filter; no human figure is drawn (L1); the August gathering is not staged.
- **Documented zeros stay zero** (the bank, the lottery office, the lyceum of the State census).
- **The frame budget moves consciously or not at all** (AGENTS.md § the frame budget; T-1154):
  every build ticket measures before it pushes and says which it did.
- **Substitution, not deletion**: `substitute_reconstruction.py` retires a reconstructed person,
  firm or roof when an attested/inferred one matches its `replaceable_by`.

## Sizing

Fifty-nine tickets, each one run (`S`/`M`), owner-requested, inserted between RESEARCH SPEND and
SOUTH THROUGH TIME. Sections over fifteen tickets are lettered sub-bands (RESIDENTS A/B/C,
STRUCTURES A–E) so different agents can take a sub-band; the queue order within a section is the
dependency order. Build tickets are `needs_bake` and hand a successor on, T-0028's shape.
