# The borderline roster — the names the research read and withheld

DERIVED, T-1159, by `tools/export_borderline_roster.py --build` from the T-1143 ledger and the resident layer, as of 2026-09-18. Do not hand-edit: `--check` re-derives this page byte-for-byte and `tools/check.sh` runs it.

The research spend was, correctly, conservative. This page does not overturn one refusal of it. A refusal was a ruling about EVIDENCE and it stands — what changes is that the reconstruction band is now shown the corpus's own names first, each with its evidence limit stated, so it names real people before it invents any.

**Nothing here is minted.** No card, grade, presence or ledger disposition is written by the tool that builds this file.

## What the roster holds

| | count |
|---|---:|
| rows | 15226 |
| ledger units considered (every non-`asserted` unit) | 23693 |
| of those, units naming no person | 9384 |

## By class

| class | rows | who | what reconstruction may do |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `R1_in_window_uncertain` | 804 | A card exists, its source is inside the window, and its presence on 1 July 1835 is `uncertain`. | Fix presence `present` at tier `reconstructed`, basis = the dated appearance plus the population model's persistence rate. |
| `R2_in_window_single_source` | 309 | One appearance inside the window, no card, the ledger withheld it as a single source or on insufficient identity. | Mint a reconstructed resident under the read name. |
| `R3_1834_return_or_muster` | 29 | A name on the 1 April 1834 post-office return (T-1153) or the 1832 Black Hawk muster enrolled at Chicago, with no 1835 corroboration and no card. | Mint reconstructed, presence bounded by the persistence rate. |
| `R4_surname_only_census` | 432 | A census reading that gives a surname this town already holds and no person of its own — the 1830 surname-only refusals and the 1840 heads. | May supply a FAMILY (spouse and child bands) to an existing head at `reconstructed`. Never a new head. |
| `R5_later_only_backprojectable` | 53 | A later-only name — the 1839 directory, the 1840 census, the old-settler rolls — whose own biography dates an arrival before 1 July 1835. | Mint reconstructed with arrival at the biography's date. |
| `R6_native_metis_black` | 139 | A Native, Métis or free Black person a source names in or near the town inside the window, whatever the ledger disposition. | Mint at the ladder's grade the evidence allows, else `reconstructed`. Always `review_required` for Native and Métis rows; `community` set. Owned by T-1177. |
| `R0_ineligible` | 13460 | Outside Chicago, the Bear Creek marriages (T-1129), the declared `researched_not_resident` names, post-scene arrivals with nothing to back-project from, and names this town already carries. | Never. |

## Twenty worked examples — five per class, R1 to R4

Five rows of each class, in the roster's own order, with the reason each name was withheld from the town. These are the rows a reader should check the rules against.

### `R1_in_window_uncertain` — 804 rows

| name as read | dated | source | why it was withheld |
|---|---|---|---|
| A. A. M'Grigg | 1834-10-22 | `hh_mgrigg_a_a` | The layer holds this household and no source follows it to 1 July 1835, so its presence stands `uncertain`. Reconstruction may fix it `present` at tier `reconstructed` against the persistence rate. |
| A B Sasoton | 1834 | `hh_sasoton_a_b` | The layer holds this household and no source follows it to 1 July 1835, so its presence stands `uncertain`. Reconstruction may fix it `present` at tier `reconstructed` against the persistence rate. |
| A. Beegle | 1834-07-16 | `hh_beegle_a` | The layer holds this household and no source follows it to 1 July 1835, so its presence stands `uncertain`. Reconstruction may fix it `present` at tier `reconstructed` against the persistence rate. |
| A Filer | 1835 (a window over the scene date, so no day before it) | `hh_filer_a` | The layer holds this household and no source follows it to 1 July 1835, so its presence stands `uncertain`. Reconstruction may fix it `present` at tier `reconstructed` against the persistence rate. |
| A. M. Wing | 1834-07-02 | `hh_wing_a_m` | The layer holds this household and no source follows it to 1 July 1835, so its presence stands `uncertain`. Reconstruction may fix it `present` at tier `reconstructed` against the persistence rate. |

## What this page does NOT claim

* **`R6` is a recall rule, not a verdict.** It is assigned by a declared term list read over the reading's own words, so that no evidence limit becomes the reason a community goes unbuilt. Every R6 row names the term that put it there; T-1177 owns the judgement and the review.

* **An `R0` row is not a person disproved.** It is a name this roster will not offer: already carried, outside Chicago, later-only with nothing to back-project from, a surname with no person, or owned by an open ruling.

* **Kin named in PROSE are out of reach, and that is a stated gap.** The rule for kin a review-flagged household names and no card carries is implemented and finds 0 today: every structured `kin` row on those eight households resolves to a household this town holds. It cannot reach a person who is named only inside a note — J. B. Beaubien's first wife Mah-naw-bun-no-quah is the case the tree states in as many words ('not a person in this dataset and no row is written for her'). Naming her here is the finished answer; guessing at prose with a pattern would not be.

* **`R4` never mints a head.** Under T-0507 an 1840 household is a SHAPE for a head that 1835 evidence already carries, never a person minted into 1835 on census counts alone.
