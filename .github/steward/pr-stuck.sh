# THE STUCK-PR REPORTER (T-1368). It merges nothing, pushes nothing and resolves
# nothing. Its whole job is that a pull request no automation in this repository
# can move is never SILENT about it.
#
# IT REPORTS TWO SHAPES. The first is the deadlock below. The second (T-1510) is a
# PR whose `gate` has COMPLETED with a failing conclusion while the steward run that
# owns the branch has finished — the one state with no owner at all in this repo, as
# the lap does not gate, `merge-ready` merges only `clean`, and the run is over.
# Measured 2026-09-21 on #1616 and #1618: both runs completed SUCCESS around the
# minute their own gate went red, and both PRs sat until a person read the logs. It
# names the failing steps, because having to open the logs is most of the cost.
#
# THE DEADLOCK IT REPORTS, stated as the cycle it is:
#
#   1. The PR is `dirty`, so GitHub cannot compute a merge ref for it.
#   2. chicago-4d-check.yml gates on `pull_request`, and a `pull_request` run needs
#      that merge ref — so the gate never starts and the PR carries ZERO check runs.
#   3. `gate` is a REQUIRED check on `dev`, so GitHub never calls the PR `clean`.
#   4. .github/steward/merge-ready.sh merges only on `clean`, deliberately, so it
#      passes over the PR every time.
#   5. .github/steward/pr-lap.sh prints `REAL CONFLICT — left alone` and stops,
#      which is CORRECT: it will not hand-merge a file no tool owns.
#
# Nothing in that loop advances. Measured twice on 2026-09-19 (#1495, #1497) and
# four more times on 2026-09-20 (#1587, #1585, #1584, #1590) — every one needed a
# person, and #1590 was a GREEN pull request that no automation could merge,
# purely because `dev` moved four times under it. Both 2026-09-19 PRs merged
# themselves within minutes of a human pushing the merge, which is the proof that
# the rest of the automation is sound: the only thing missing was a person being
# TOLD.
#
# WHY LOUD AND NOT GATED — the ticket offers both and asks for the reading to be
# written down, so here it is. The other option was to dispatch the gate for the
# branch (`workflow_dispatch` is already on chicago-4d-check.yml). It was rejected
# on merit, not on cost: a dispatched run gates the BRANCH, not the merge result,
# and it attaches a `gate` check run to the PR's head sha. That check would
# satisfy a REQUIRED check with a verdict about a tree that is not the one that
# would land — the branch as it stands, without `dev`'s last several merges in it.
# And it still would not merge: `dirty` is not `clean`, whatever the checks say.
# So gating a conflicted PR buys a green tick that means less than the empty space
# it replaces. A reported PR is worth more than a falsely-gated one.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES TO TOUCH, and each refusal is a fault this ticket names:
#
#   * `hold`. The owner's park switch. A held PR is `dirty` with zero check runs
#     and looks EXACTLY like the deadlock from outside — #1533 and #1576 were both
#     mistaken for it on 2026-09-20. Labels are read before anything is declared.
#   * Drafts. The steward's salvage step opens one for a run that died before its
#     PR; it is not a queue member.
#   * A PR WHOSE OWNING RUN IS STILL ALIVE. #1499 was `dirty` with zero check runs
#     and looked identical to the real thing; its run was still going, and it
#     rebased onto `dev` twice, re-derived, pushed and cleared ITSELF. A fix that
#     labels or comments on a mid-run PR is a fault of T-1368 in its own words,
#     because such a PR commonly resolves itself and colliding with a live run
#     costs more than waiting. The branch's `claim/t-nnnn` marker names the run;
#     this asks GitHub whether that run is still going.
#   * A PR whose head is younger than STUCK_MIN_AGE_MIN. Every PR is `dirty` for a
#     while after a merge into `dev` — that is T-0857 and it is the normal state of
#     this queue, not a fault. The lap is what clears it. Shouting at a PR the lap
#     has not reached yet would make this reporter noise, and noise is how the
#     previous signals were lost.
#
# REST, NEVER GraphQL, for the reason pr-lap.sh and merge-ready.sh both give at
# length: `gh pr` and `gh issue` are GraphQL, the steward PAT's GraphQL budget is
# the one that runs out, and on 2026-09-14 it ran out while REST sat untouched.
# Every call below is a REST path.
